 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> is planning to ask the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to scale back the congressional pay raise scheduled to take effect next week, even as <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members were lining up overwhelmingly against the increase, a congressional source said Wednesday. The $ 45,500 pay raise _ a 51 percent hike _ will take effect next Wednesday unless both the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote to block it. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, plans to propose that the increase be scaled back to 30 percent, said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity. A 30 percent raise would hike the current congressional salary from $ 89,500 by $ 26,850, to a total of $ 116,350. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> plans to seek a vote on approving the lower raise on Feb. 9, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Thursday editions. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members indicated in an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey that they want a vote on the sensitive issue. Survey results put additional pressure on <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to abandon a carefully orchestrated strategy of taking no vote until after the raise automatically takes effect next Wednesday. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said Tuesday he would hold a vote if that was what lawmakers wanted. The speaker announced he was circulating a questionnaire privately to determine whether <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members really wanted a recorded vote. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s tally was not made available Wednesday. However, an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> informal survey of nearly a third of the 435 House members showed about 88 percent of those responding wanted a vote on the pay raise. Meanwhile, a survey of the entire <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> released Wednesday by opponents of the pay raise showed 62 percent saying they would vote `` no'' if the issue came to a vote. Under the law, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and other top federal officials will get pay raises of about 50 percent on Feb. 8 unless both chambers reject it. Rank-and-file congressional salaries would go from $ 89,500 to $ 135,000, under the recommendation submitted by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and supported by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, has promised a vote in his chamber this week. Surveys show the pay raise would be handily rejected there. House Democratic leaders, with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> consent, had adopted a strategy of avoiding a vote until after the deadline and then softening the political blow of the substantial pay raise by passing new ethics rules including a ban on lawmakers accepting speaking fees. The strategy was based on the opinion that <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members supported the raise but would find it politically impossible to vote for it. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who had been taking most of the political heat on the issue, changed that strategy on Tuesday. His survey was designed, in part, to demonstrate that it was not <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> alone who favored the pay increase. `` Over the past several weeks, I have heard from many members on both sides of the aisle. I have a pretty good idea of how they feel,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. `` They support ` regular procedure''' _ which would mean committee hearings and a legislative schedule that would make a vote impossible before the Feb. 8 deadline. But when asked if he would permit a vote should members surprise him and demand one, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, `` If the members want it, yes, of course'' The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> contacted 143 congressional offices and found 92 members publicly supporting a recorded vote on the pay raise. Only six said they were against it and seven were undecided. There was no response from 38 offices. It should be noted that advocates of the pay raise have been reluctant to publicly indicate their support, for fear of the political fallout. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s spokesman, said it would be wrong to use any informal surveys to predict the results of the speaker's private survey. However, another top leadership aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity, pointed out that the speaker's survey could compound the political problem if the results are at odds with those from media surveys. Several lawmakers who were following the leadership strategy of keeping silent on the issue privately expressed aggravation at the speaker's new tactic. `` This is like a war in which the general says to take the hill, you turn around, and find the general's gone,'' said a Republican member who spoke on the condition of anonymity. If a vote were scheduled, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members overwhelmingly would reject the pay increase, according to a survey released Wednesday by several groups opposed to the increase. The survey said 270 House members, or about 62 percent, said they would oppose the raise if it came to a vote. Forty-seven, or about 11 percent, said they would support the raise; 75 members, about 17 percent, declined to state a position, and 41 members, about 9 percent, declined to respond. The survey was conducted by <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION>, a consumer advocacy group founded by <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>; the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxpayers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, a non-partisan organization of fiscal conservatives; and <ORGANIZATION> Coalitions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative organization headed by activist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON>. After the survey was released, Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Carper </PERSON>, R-Del., said he too was against the raise, even though the survey had listed him as undecided Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, was also listed as undecided, but has been publicly opposed to the raise for more than a week. `` A failure to vote on this issue would be a fundamental breakdown of democracy,'' said <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Claybrook </PERSON>, president of Public Citizen. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> opponents of the pay increase, at a hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the current system of allowing pay increases to take effect without a vote was hurting <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' public image `` What must they think of us, when we run from accountability, as cockroaches run from bright light?'' said Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, R-N.H. Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION> told the committee that, `` People all over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are saying, ` They're a bunch of crooks'.'' But committee member <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, said the raise was needed, especially for judges and federal officials. `` What does it cost government to have incompetent people at the top?'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> asked. With the future of the pay raise uncertain, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators were moving ahead Wednesday with their separate but similar efforts to draft ethics legislation to bar honoraria and restrict other outside income.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may be getting his ducks in a row on the federal budget, but he certainly does n't want any of his budget lines to turn up as ducks. That's because a duck by any other name in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> these days is a tax increase. And <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials insist there'll be no ducks _ new taxes _ in the budget plan <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sends <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 9. This duck business started when budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> wrote a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> reaffirming <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s intention to resist new taxes. On whether the administration might hide a tax under another name, <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> suggested that would n't wash. Most Americans, he suggested, know that `` if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck.'' That's an old line, but <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> gave it new currency. Now it has joined the lexicon of other budget cliches, mentioned almost as frequently these days as that mythical budget `` table'' that items are always described as being off or on. As in, nothing's `` off the table.'' Or everything's `` on the table.'' `` Not to mix metaphors, but ducks are off the table,'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself has picked up on the duck talk. At his first news conference, he was asked whether a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> proposal for a depositor fee to assist troubled savings-and-loans might violate his anti-tax stand. `` I would refer you to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>,'' the president responded. `` He's the guy that defined that very well up there with the duck test on the Hill.'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> repeatedly used the duck analogy during his confirmation hearings. He was presented at one point with a mock trophy by committee Chairman Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>. It consisted of three bright yellow toy ducks and the label, `` if it quacks, it's a tax.'' White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> threw yet another ingredient into the duck soup _ a rose. Asked at a news conference whether he thought the savings and loan fee was a tax, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> responded obliquely: `` Yesterday's rose is tomorrow's rose.'' When he did not elaborate further, he was asked: `` A rose is a rose?'' and `` It passes the rose test?'' `` Let's put it this way,'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said. `` Yesterday's duck is tomorrow's duck.'' Actually today's duck is not yesterday's duck, so far as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is concerned. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s duck of yesteryear was not a tax increase but a Sandinista. When running for re-election in 1984, then-Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> caused something of a stir in a campaign speech at <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> as he portrayed the Sandinista government in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as Marxist. `` If you walk like a duck and you quack like a duck and you say you're a duck, you're a duck,'' he said. But so far, the new <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has n't reported any conversations with tax ducks.

<HEAD>Mixed-up Wiring, Plumbing in 17 Airliners Prompts Blanket Order</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 700 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> jetliners operated by every major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline must undergo a comprehensive inspection for cross-wiring and cross-plumbing in their safety systems, after problems were discovered in 17 aircraft. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administraton </ORGANIZATION>, in issuing the `` airworthiness directive'' late Tuesday, also noted that <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is studying its design, production procedures and testing of airliner emergency systems to see if changes are needed. The newly ordered tests are not expected to disrupt airline schedules and can be completed anytime over the next 3 -LCB- weeks while the airliners are undergoing routine maintenance. The order affects 741 newer jetliners flown by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers. It applies to all <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s, 747s, 757s and 767s built after Dec. 31, 1980. Most foreign airliners using the planes also are expected to comply, although the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has no jurisdiction over them. `` The comprehensive -LRB- directive -RRB- will require functional testing of the engine and cargo compartment fire detection, warning and extinguishing systems, both electrical and plumbing to insure that crossed wiring or plumbing does not exist,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> announcement. No accident or emergency has resulted from faulty wiring or plumbing found in airliners in recent weeks after the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> issued limited directives applying to only specific systems in certain types of aircraft. But the foulups, including cross-wiring, cross-plumbing, incomplete wiring and other problems, could have caused shutdown of the wrong engine in the event of fire, activation of the wrong sprinkling system in a cargo hold or lack of any response in emergency systems. The concern arose with speculation that the pilot in a Jan. 8 British <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> 737 crash that killed 44 people in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> may have been deceived by faulty wiring into shutting down his only good engine. Cause of the crash is still under investigation. The crash led to similar inspection orders in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Airbus 320s also were included in the British order, although problems have been found only in <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> aircraft. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said Tuesday night that the directive is based on service bulletins <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has been putting out in recent months and years. Service bulletins are sent out each time a problem of some sort is found with a model of a plane to all carriers using that model and to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>. Checks of planes are voluntary after a service bulletin is issued. But if the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> sees a pattern in the bulletins, it is likely to issue a directive, making checks of the airliners mandatory. `` It's a preventive and precautionary check,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said the latest order, which gives airlines 25 days to comply, would not disrupt regularly scheduled flights. He said planes whose systems were already tested under previous orders need not retest under the new order. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> said `` a lot of the'57 and'37 stuff already has been done.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> estimated the inspections would cost airlines a total of $ 222,000. Airline analysts say, however, that actual cost of FAA-ordered inspections is generally two or three times higher than the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> estimates. It said the order is a `` precautionary measure'' triggered by newly discovered problems with three 757s and a 737. <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said he did not know which airlines reported the latest cases of faulty wiring. On one plane, an overheat indicator would have shown a problem in the wrong engine. In two others, fire extinguishers would have been triggered in the wrong engines. In the fourth, an incomplete circuit would have prevented a fire extinguisher from firing. The first cross-wiring directive applying only to two 737 models found no problems. A second triggered by reports of cross-wiring in two 757s, resulted in discovery of five more miswired aircraft. Earlier directives followed discovery of improperly installed plumbing in two 767s. The inspections exposed four other aircraft with similar problems that, in the event of a fire in one of two holds, would have routed extinguishing fluids to the hold that was not burning. The inspections would cover 472 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s, 33 Jumbo 747s, 123 757s and 113 767s, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Authorities have discovered the bodies of six people who were shot in the head with a shotgun near a trailer compound, and one of the residents has been charged with two of the deaths. The body of a man found Tuesday in the rusted hull of a car in a junkyard near the three-trailer compound appeared to have been shot twice in the back of the head at close range, said Assistant State Medical Examiner Dr. <PERSON> Vasudeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kshirsagar </PERSON>. The condition of the body indicated that the victim had been dead several months, <PERSON> Kshirsagar </PERSON> said, adding that the five others appeared to have been killed in a similar manner. Police believe the body is that of 20-year-old <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schillings </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, who came to the compound to live last spring and was reported missing last summer. On Monday, the body of 22-year-old <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> was found on the site about 30 feet from the car, authorities said. The junkyard is about 200 yards east of the compound, where the first two bodies were discovered Jan. 8. `` We have a consistent pattern. It was a shotgun. It was consistent with the other cases,'' said <LOCATION> Kanawha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>. If all six bodies are linked to the same killer, it would be the worst series of deaths in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> attributed to the same person. Authorities said 19-year-old <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Southern </PERSON> <PERSON> McCallister </PERSON> is being held without bond on charges of murdering brothers <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanson </PERSON>, who lived with <PERSON> McCallister </PERSON> at the compound in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Albans </LOCATION>, a town of 15,000 people 15 miles west of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. Prosecutors said <PERSON> McCallister </PERSON> has confessed to the brothers' murders Police found the body of the Sansons' sister, <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON>, at an abandoned motel across the street from the compound on Jan. 21. Another victim, <PERSON> McCallister </PERSON>'s grandmother, <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, 69, was found in her nearby home. `` We hope this ight wrap up the investigation from the standpoint of looking for people,'' <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> said. The sheriff's department declined to say whether <PERSON> McCallister </PERSON> would be charged in the other deaths or to speculate on a motive. However, authorities said all the victims lived at the compound, which is now abandoned, and Price and Schillings had dated <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Researchers Show Fast Method for Robot Depth Perception</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Want to see how some robots of the future may find their way around? Hold a finger in front of you and stare at it. Now shake your head, still focusing on that finger. Objects behind your finger appear to move in the same direction as your head, while those in front of it move in the opposite direction. Using that principle, researchers have demonstrated a fast method for depth perception in visually guided robots, which should help them navigate around objects more quickly, a scientist says. A robot at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state trains a pair of cameras on an object to gauge the distance to it, said <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>, a computer science professor at the university. The distance measurement is updated 30 times a second, <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said, so `` it potentially allows you to move at high speed.'' Current robots guided by visual feedback can move only slowly because of the time it takes them to judge the location of objects in their path, he said Tuesday. <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorpe </PERSON>, research scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> Robotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie-Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> robot is the first to combine several previously known concepts into such a high-speed system. The cameras are mounted on a motor-driven platform that allows them to move up and down or side to side. The platform is mounted on the end of a large industrial robot arm, allowing the platform to move over a range about 12 feet in diameter at speeds up to about one yard per second. Currently, a human directs the cameras to a reference point, but eventually that will occur automatically, <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. The work shows it is easier for computers to calculate distance to objects if the images come from moving cameras than if the cameras are stationary, he said. The research also demonstrated a way for the pair of cameras to remain locked on an object while it moves toward the robot, an ability called vergence, he said. The work was led by <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> and colleague <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has asked anti-apartheid activist <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> to disband her group of teen-age bodyguards, which has been accused of kidnapping and engaging in gang feuds. Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> and community leaders in the black township of <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> support disbanding the group, known as the <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> soccer club, saying it hurts the campaign to end white minority rule. Several newspapers have reported that continuing allegations that the youth group has engaged in unlawful behavior have become a source of friction between Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and her husband <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s best-known black leader. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has been imprisoned since 1962 for his <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> activities. `` Winnie ca n't afford to have the <LOCATION> Mandela </LOCATION> name dragged through the mud by associating with these people,'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> newspaper Business Day reported Tuesday. At the <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> headquarters of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebina </PERSON> said Tuesday that the message about <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> was sent to Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> after discussions among the organization's leaders The youths, who generally wear track suits, often accompany Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> to public gatherings. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> last week said she had disbanded the group because of `` state harassment.'' But several of the youths were present Saturday when she attended the funeral of a slain activist. While guarding Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, the youths occasionally have threatened journalists and others. In July, the <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> family home in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> was destroyed in a fire set by a gang of black high school students who had been feuding with <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> members. <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> also has been accused of abducting four youths from a <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> church. One of the four still is missing. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and others have alleged the kidnapped youths may have been sexually abused by a church clergyman. About 150 <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> community leaders met last week to investigate the abductions, and later urged that <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> be disbanded. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, widely viewed abroad as a hero of the fight against the white minority government's policy of racial separation, has become entangled in several controversies in recent years. She has endorsed `` necklace'' killings, whereby black activists set alight gasoline-soaked tires placed around the necks of so-called government collaborators. She also has been criticized for building the mansion in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, although she has never moved into it.

<HEAD>Many People Missing out on SSI Benefits</HEAD>

 Almost half of the nation's senior citizens who may be eligible for Supplemental Security Income benefits are not enrolled in the program, according to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION>. SSI provides monthly cash payments to eligible low-income people who are 65 years and older, blind or disabled. The maximum federal SSI benefit this year is $ 368 a month for an individual and $ 553 a month for a couple. Some states supplement the payments with their own funds. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> estimates that 36 percent of SSI recipients receive state supplements. The study, conducted for <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> ICF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a research and consulting firm, said its finding was consistent with other surveys that have put the <ORGANIZATION> SSI </ORGANIZATION> participation rate at about 50 percent. Another study conducted for <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> found that one-third of the eligible older people who are not receiving <ORGANIZATION> SSI </ORGANIZATION> benefits have never heard of the program, and many others are misinformed about eligibility requirements.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> panel has set new guidelines on how often people need dental X-rays, saying its goal is to eliminate any unneeded radiation exposure. Children with healthy teeth may need dental X-rays no more than once every year or two, and dentally healthy adults once every two or three years, the panel said. The guidelines, reported in the current issue of the Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, were prompted by concern among some experts about the frequency of dental X-rays, both overuse and underuse. `` Although the radiation risk from a dental X-ray is extremely low, our goal is to eliminate any unneeded radiation exposure,'' <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said in statement Tuesday. `` Until these guidelines were developed, there were few concrete criteria a dentist could use in deciding when X-rays were needed,'' he said. Young also stressed the flexibility of the guidelines, saying, `` These are not hard and fast rules. In deciding whether an X-ray is needed, the dentist must use clinical judgment in evaluating the patient's needs.''

 The `` First Lady of <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>'' has been chosen as the first female grand marshal of the St. Patrick's Day parade in its 226-year history. And <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> <PERSON> Cudahy </PERSON> _ who accepted the honor with smilin' Irish eyes, not tearful ones _ says it's about time Mrs. <PERSON> Cudahy </PERSON>, 66, had been passed over in favor of a man in three previous years before she was elected Tuesday night to lead the 200,000 marchers in the nation's largest and oldest St. Patrick's Day celebration Afterward, she said <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> women have too often been left standing in the wings while men took center stage. `` Like everything else, men run it but women do all the work,'' she said of past parades. `` When I march up there, ladies and gentleman, girls and boys will remember my mother and your mother and all the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> women who came over here and did so much,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Cudahy </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Cudahy </PERSON> and the other nominee, 61-year-old <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Holt </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, were on stage in front of 600 people in a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> ballroom when the vote was announced. Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, a school teacher, hugged and kissed the winner. Mrs. <PERSON> Cudahy </PERSON> is known as the `` First Lady of Irish Radio'' for her `` Irish Memories'' program, which moved last August to WNWK-FM after more than 40 years on <ORGANIZATION> WEVD </ORGANIZATION>. `` This achievement was really your achievement,'' she told the delegates. The vote was narrow, 256 to 233, but the crowd seemed unanimous in its delight at seeing a woman chosen to lead the March 17 parade up Fifth Avenue. `` I guess we are a chauvinistic race,'' said delegate <PERSON> Noah </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingston </PERSON>. `` I suppose the European races in general are. We've always just went along with the status quo But the times have changed and it's long overdue really.'' `` It's about time,'' said <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonnell </PERSON>, a member of the Ancient Order of Hibernians. `` The women in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> used to hold a high place before the English invaded.'' The delegates who picked the grand marshal were chosen from about 200 affiliated organizations that march in the more than 40-block-long parade, which usually attracts more than a million spectators. The organizations include the Ancient Order of Hibernians, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Counties </ORGANIZATION> and schools and fraternal organizations. Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said her name would not be on the ballot again. `` They kept saying, ` Next year,' and I said, ` No way,' `` she said. Although Mrs. <PERSON> Cudahy </PERSON> was widely expected to win this year, she said she `` just could n't believe it'' when the votes were tallied. But she accepted the honor with dry eyes and said she will be `` representing all the women of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> who came over as immigrants.'' `` I'm not the crying type,'' she said. `` I guess I'm not reacting like a woman, but I'm so happy.''

 President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>, who completes a turbulent first month in office today, is trying hard to vanquish a legacy of ethnic violence and chart a more peaceful course for his island nation. Since taking over Jan. 2, he has freed more than 1,400 political prisoners and lifted tough emergency laws that were imposed 5 -LCB- years ago in an effort to control an insurgency by minority Tamil extremists. Political rivals credit <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> with shrewd moves. `` He had to do something startling with the looming general elections,'' scheduled for Feb. 15, said <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponnabalam </PERSON>, leader of the opposition All <ORGANIZATION> Ceylon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Despite <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s efforts, an extremist group whose members are of the Sinhalese ethnic majority has stepped up attacks aimed at thwarting the vote. Police say The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> killed 600 people in January alone. A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, termed the figure `` a bit far-fetched'', but declined to say how many people he thought had been killed. For <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>, who served as prime minister under former president <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>, the parliamentary elections will be vital since his plans could be stalled if his <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> does not gain a parliamentary majority. `` The period to come is -LRB- <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s -RRB- greatest challenge,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bultjens </PERSON>, a veteran Sri Lanka-watcher and a political science professor at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Feb. 15 is his most urgent hour.'' In the year leading up to the Dec. 19 presidential election, Sinhalese extremists killed more than 800 people, mostly government officials, supporters and police, authorities said. Most of the victims were Sinhalese, who comprise 75 percent of the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island's 16 million people and dominate the government, which the front says has made too many concessions to the Tamils. During his election campaign, <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> took pains not to blame the Sinhalese guerrillas for the violence. Instead, he made fervent appeals to the front to lay down arms and join mainstream politics. But <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s `` gamble failed,'' said another Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` The Sinhalese extremists are bent upon violence and will not heed appeals.'' Despite the violence, <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> will fulfill campaign promises to help the poor, said <PERSON> Ranjan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wijeratna </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> plans to give $ 75 monthly to 1.4 million families that live in extreme poverty. The annual per capita income of nearly half the country's population is well below the national average of $ 360. Some of <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> campaign promises that have already materialized: 3,500 Indian soldiers were withdrawn and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> agreed to consider <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s promise to change the Indian-Sri Lankan peace accord into a friendship treaty. The July 1987 accord, an attempt to end the Tamil insurgency, allowed Indian troops onto the island to disarm Tamil guerrillas. But <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s attempt to play peacemaker for its southern neighbor met with resistance from Tamil militants and at least 600 Indian soldiers have been killed. About 44,000 Indian soldiers remain in the country. The Tamil separatist war has claimed about 8,500 lives, most of them Sinhalese civilians.

<HEAD>Majority Of Koreans Oppose Abolishing Adultery As Crime: Survey</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A slim majority of South Koreans oppose abolishing a law under which people convicted of adultery can be sentenced up to a year in jail, according to a survey released today. These South Koreans feel that if penalties for adultery are revoked, illicit sex will increase and public morals will decline, the <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Applied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said its survey indicates. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> has said it will ask the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to abolish the law, but the institute said 51 percent of those polled oppose the move to drop adultery from the criminal codes. The private research institute said 60 percent of the 752 women surveyed and 42 percent of the 756 male respondents wanted to keep the law. The survey was conducted Jan. 18-20 in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Pollsters said 53 percent of the respondents in their 20s also felt adultery should remain a crime. When those in favor of abolishing the law were asked their reasons, 66 percent said adultery was an individual concern, not a matter for the government. Twelve percent said the law does n't keep spouses faithful. Seventy percent who wanted to keep the law said promiscuity and immoral sexual behavior would increase without it. Sixteen percent said wives would be hurt by losing a legal handle to check indiscretions committed by husbands. Forty percent said men would benefit more than women if the law were changed and only 11 percent said women had more to gain. Nearly half of those polled, 46 percent, thought adultery was on the rise and 25 percent said it was increasing at an `` alarming rate.'' No margin of error was given for the survey.

 The dollar resumed its strong gains against the Japanese yen today, while share prices plunged on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as the dollar's rise discouraged investors, dealers said. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 13.80-point gainer Tuesday, lost 220.62 points, or 0.70 percent, closing at 31,360.68. The index started downward in early trading after the dollar's higher opening in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Kiyoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Iwasaki </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest brokerage `` Since the majority of investors have been concerned over the index's rapid rise recently, they began concertedly selling as prices went down,'' he added. A major influence on the Nikkei, he said, was a decline in financial issues. Today's trading, dominated by sell orders, was active, with volume on the first section estimated at 1 billion shares. On the foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at 130.40, up 1.27 yen from Tuesday's close of 129.13 yen. The dollar opened at 130.58 and ranged between 130.20 yen and 130.67 yen. The dollar had gained a total of 2.21 yen last Friday and Monday, but fell 0.60 yen on Tuesday before climbing again.

<HEAD>Herpes Virus Becomes Resistant to Common Antiviral Drug</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The appearance of viruses that can escape the herpes drug may be an early sign that a new class of medicines designed to wipe out viruses will be outwitted by its foes, just as bacteria-killing drugs have been, researchers say. Disease-causing herpes viruses that are resistant to the widely used drug acyclovir have been seen in AIDS patients, who have little natural ability to ward off microbes. Resistant viruses have not been found in otherwise healthy people who take the drug for ordinary outbreaks of genital herpes sores. Researchers disagree over whether the resistant viruses will spread into the general population. `` We see no lack of efficacy of acyclovir in normal patients. I do n't think it should be a concern at all,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, a senior scientist at <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which produces the drug. However, Dr. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said the current situation may parallel the development of penicillin in the 1940s. `` For the last 40 years, it's been a battle between the organism and the drug to see which can outwit the other, and it's been a series of new drugs to try to overcome bacterial resistance,'' <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> said in an interview. `` Viruses have never presented that problem up until now, but it would n't surprise me that during the next 40 years we see the same kind of phenomenon developing in virology.'' Two reports on drug-resistant viruses are being published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. In one of the studies, doctors described the cases of 12 AIDS patients who developed severe herpes infections that did not respond to acyclovir. One co-author, Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, estimates that one in 1,000 AIDS patients has acyclovir-resistant herpes. In the other study, doctors reported two AIDS victims and one leukemia patient who had overwhelming cytomegalovirus, or CMV, infection that could not be treated with ganciclovir, a still-experimental antiviral drug. Researchers believe that resistance occurs through natural genetic mutation. A strain of the virus emerges that has genes making it impervious to a drug. Then the resistant strain multiplies and spreads through the victim's body while all the other forms of the virus are killed off by the medicine. An estimated 30 million Americans are infected with the genital herpes virus, known as herpes simplex virus type 2. Most of them never develop any symptoms. But for the minority with recurring genital sores, acyclovir is the only treatment, although others are being tested. Cytomegalovirus infects an estimated 60 percent to 90 percent of Americans and rarely causes illness in otherwise healthy people. However, in those whose disease defenses are weak, the virus can attack organs through the body, resulting in blindness or death. Ever since acyclovir's introduction seven years ago as the first widely available antiviral drug, some virus researchers have worried that the herpes virus would evolve into forms that could elude the medicine and still cause disease. `` What we had feared for many years would happen now appears to be happening, at least in the AIDS population,'' said <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>. Dr. <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>, a co-author of one of the studies, said he expects drug-resistant viruses to complicate treatment of organ transplant patients. They must take immunity-lowering drugs to keep their bodies from rejecting their new organs. Since the drug-resistant viruses have not been seen in healthy people, doctors can not be sure whether the viruses will become a problem for the general population. `` One concern is that someone with AIDS could give one of these resistant viruses to someone else, and then it could become established in the normal population,'' said <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crumpacker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Beth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, another co-author of the research, said he doubts this will happen. `` I have been aware of most of the cases of resistance that have occurred, and it is an unlikely event,'' he said. `` It is not occurring in the normal population that we have been watching.''

<TEXT>
 A judge today acquitted a prominent supporter of <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> of rebellion, saying his takeover of a provincial government during a 1987 coup attempt was not violent enough to merit conviction. But Judge <PERSON> Maximiano </PERSON> <PERSON> Asuncion </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Dulay </PERSON> to 10 months in prison and fined him the equivalent of $ 50 for trying to strangle the governor and holding other officials and employees of <PERSON> Quirino </PERSON> province during the Aug. 28, 1987 coup attempt, in which 53 people were killed in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. It was the most serious of about a half-dozen coup attempts since President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> rose to power in a February 1986 revolt that sent <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> into exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. Records of the case show that <PERSON> Dulay </PERSON> and about 50 rebel soldiers and police barged into the capitol building in the Qurino provincial capital of <LOCATION> Cabarroguis </LOCATION> and announced a takeover of the local government. But in acquitting <PERSON> Dulay </PERSON> and four other defendants, <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION> said that announcing a takeover and appointing new officials `` are not sufficient to hold them liable for the crime of rebellion.'' `` To constitute rebellion, there must be some sort of public uprising which is absent in the instant case,'' said the judge. `` And when we say public uprising, there must be men engaging in war against the forces of government.'' `` In order to commit the crime rebellion, there must be public uprising and taking of arms against the government,'' the judge added. <PERSON> Dulay </PERSON> has been in jail since March 1987 _ longer than his sentence. But <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION> did not order Dulay's release because he faces charges of murdering two supporters of Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> during the February 1986 presidential election. <PERSON> Dulay </PERSON> was in jail in <LOCATION> Quirino </LOCATION>, 100 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, pending trial on the murder charges when the coup attempt began. Some of the soldiers and policemen who preceded him to the capitol building during the brief takeover were his prison guards. During the trial, prosecutors presented witnesses who described how <PERSON> Dulay </PERSON> wrung the neck of Gov. <PERSON> Renicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Delizo </PERSON> and yelled: `` Goddamn, you will die, I will kill you.'' <PERSON> Dulay </PERSON>, who was dressed in military combat fatigues, then put a gun to <PERSON> Delizo </PERSON>'s head, the witnesses said. <PERSON> Dulay </PERSON> and his armed followers next herded <PERSON> Delizo </PERSON> and others into the governor's office and held them there until midnight, when it became clear in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> that the coup attempt had failed. <PERSON> Dulay </PERSON> acknowledged that he grabbed <PERSON> Delizo </PERSON> by the neck but claimed that was merely for `` psychological effect.'' He also said it was not he was who tried to takeover <PERSON> Quirino </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dulay </PERSON> headed the provincial chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Quirino </LOCATION>. He and his followers were accused of murdering two civilians campaigning for Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Quirino </LOCATION> during the 1986 election which both Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> claimed they won. <PERSON> Dulay </PERSON> was arrested shortly after <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> left, but escaped from a suburban <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> military prison. He resurfaced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but was expelled back to <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> on March 18, 1987. Last June, armed men attacked the stockade at <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s Camp Crame, where <PERSON> Dulay </PERSON> was held, in what the military said was a bid to free him. The group failed to free <PERSON> Dulay </PERSON> but looted the garrison's armory

<TEXT>
 Armed with cash and cameras, foreign trekkers by the thousands are scouring the hills of northern <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> for unspoiled tribal people, turning the region into `` a human zoo,'' critics say. Thai officials, <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> missionaries and others interviewed say these increasingly popular treks by Western Europeans, Americans and Australians are hastening the erosion of traditional culture among 500,000 tribal people already reeling under rapid modernization. Villagers are selling their colorful costumes, jewelry and other heirlooms or exchanging them for jeans and other Western goods offered by trekkers. And intruding brusquely into village life are some Westerners who, as former tour operator <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> recalls, `` run around with their breasts hanging out.'' `` Nothing is free now. Their traditional hospitality has been corrupted,'' says American missionary <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Morse </PERSON>. `` Before they would offer food and lodging to strangers. Now they no longer accept people for who they are. They have become hardened, less open.'' According to the government's tourist authority, tribal trekking has grown from a handful of hikers in the 1970s to more than 100,000 last year. Most sign up with tour companies in this major northern Thai city, then make their way by jeep, bamboo raft, elephant, motorcyle or foot to the hill villages of the Akha, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON>, Hmong, <LOCATION> Lisu </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lahu </PERSON> and other tribes. The trekking companies capitalize on the region's natural beauty and the lure of the exotic and notorious _ the area is part of the so-called Golden Triangle of opium fields and warlord armies. `` Padaung hill tribes now available,'' reads one typical advertisement, which has prompted critics to charge that the tribal people are being marketed like animals on a safari or in a zoo. Young, a longtime <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> resident of northern <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, says trekking agencies vary greatly. Some, he says, educate clients about local cultures while others may offer an `` opium experience'' and provide opportunities for `` authentic'' photographs by getting tribesmen to smoke their opium pipes or engage in courtship rituals. Some trekkers have died of drug overdoses. Violence and robbery against tourists _ once unheard of _ are on the rise as cultures clash and cash is haphazardly injected into primitive economies. <PERSON> Suppakit </PERSON> <PERSON> Apasil </PERSON>, director of the government's tourism office in <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Mai </PERSON>, says part of the trouble stems from lack of controls over the mushrooming agencies and the trekking industry, which brings $ 5 million annually to the city. <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Mai </PERSON> has 110 agencies, some no more than a table in a restaurant catering to backpackers, offering tours that range from $ 6 to $ 100 and guides whose knowledge of tribal languages and lore varies as widely. The government has no regulatory powers but provides would-be trekkers with a list of warnings and recommendations and helped organize a <ORGANIZATION> Jungle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, an association of about 50 trekking outfits that attempts to raise standards. <PERSON> Wanat </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruksasri </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, lists tourism among factors changing hill tribe life. Other factors are greater road access, population growth, an influx of lowlanders and the impact of foreign and Thai development agencies. `` See real primitive hill tribes in the Thai jungle, if you're looking for an intensive and unforgettable experience,'' announces one trekking company But some who sign up are in for a disappointment. After a long walk through deforested hills, trekkers may well come upon a village where the natives watch television, drive Japanese pick-up trucks and wear jeans purchased from previous trekkers.

<HEAD>Administration Reluctantly Supports Cutting Deduction on Debt</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto WX9</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is giving qualified support to cutting the tax deduction for interest on debt incurred in leveraged buyouts, saying it prefers fairer tax treatment of traditional forms of raising capital. `` If you're going to make a change _ and clearly we're not suggesting one _ we would suggest that you look in the area of perhaps limiting interest deductions and using that money to give a break to corporate owners of stock,'' Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> told the tax-writing <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said the `` driving force'' behind the LBO phenomenon is that companies can avoid a 34 percent corporate income tax rate by raising capital through debt rather than stock. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also has been attempting to find a way through <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> regulations or a legislative proposal to make the tax treatment of stock-equity and bond-debt financing more equal. `` The LBO problem would disappear with a level playing field,'' he said. `` But so far we have n't been able to come up with a way to do it.'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> also suggested that the best action might be inaction. `` We have a habit of correcting things just as they are about to correct themselves,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. `` If we wait a little longer, this thing is not going to gobble us up.'' But <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> conceded the administration is concerned about the rapid rate with which companies are going into debt to launch takeovers or defend against them through stock buybacks _ both often financed by high-interest junk bonds. Rep. <PERSON> J.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, likened <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s qualified endorsement of taxing interest on takeover-related debt to `` a kiss through a veil'' and criticized him for not coming up with specific suggestions or data on the impact of the buyouts on the federal treasury. With a `` that depends'' answer, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> evaded a question on whether President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s desire to reduce the capital gains tax would only encourage more buyouts since shareholders would have to pay less tax on the 35 percent to 45 percent above-market prices they often get in the transactions. Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., said it is ironic the outcry for congressional action to curb takeovers `` has become deafening'' in the past 16 months In 1987 the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had approved similar legislation to limit the tax deductibility of interest on junk bonds and other borrowing used in financing takeovers. But it suffered a quick death in negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> after then-Treasury Secretary and now Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> tried to blame the bill as the cause of the October 1987 stock market crash. Since then, the size of companies being taken over through junk bonds has increased several times. And instead of just plants closing and workers losing jobs, owners of more traditional long-term, investment-grade bonds in the companies being acquired have seen the value of their holdings diminished in some takeovers. For example, holders of some $ 5 billion in long-term bonds in <ORGANIZATION> RJR-Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, lost $ 1 billion overnight when credit agencies downgraded their rating upon the announcement of the company's takeover by <ORGANIZATION> LBO </ORGANIZATION> specialist <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> and other lawmakers also have questioned whether many of the newly restructured companies will be able to make the interest payments on their much higher debt and avoid bankruptcy if and when a recession `` I have a feeling that we're looking at a <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale that's showing zero and then we have an eruption of 7 or 8 on the scale and it's too late,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, using a major earthquake as a metaphor

<HEAD>Watergate Jury Selection a Model for North's Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Watergate cases of the mid-1970s could provide a road map for selection of a jury in <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial that will not be biased by pretrial publicity, legal experts say. `` I would say Watergate is your best guide. From what I can understand the Iran-Contra hearings wo n't exceed publicity of that,'' says Professor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenhalgh </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. There are important parallels between the prosecution of the leading Watergate defendants and <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s case, <PERSON> Greenhalgh </PERSON> said Tuesday. Most notably, he said, the trials in both instances were preceded by congressional hearings that attracted vast television audiences. A federal appeals court upheld the Watergate convictions, saying the defendants' rights were protected by the careful questioning of prospective jurors to guard against prejudice from pretrial publicity. `` That's what -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> is doing now,'' <PERSON> Greenhalgh </PERSON> said. `` He has a road map. And if he's following it I think he'll be all right.'' Professor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> agreed. `` We have an imperfect system that stumbles through,'' he said. `` It's not an impossibility to get a jury'' in the North trial that will be unbiased. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> also said it is easier to guard against prejudiced jurors in federal cases because the judges generally do the questioning in empaneling jurors. In the state courts, he said, the quizzing is done by the lawyers on each side. As <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial began Tuesday, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said there may be problems finding an impartial jury as required by the Constitution because so many people have seen or read of North's testimony in congressional hearings. Only 16 of the first 54 prospective jurors indicated on questionnaires that they were n't exposed to <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s congressional appearances, the judge said. North, a former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide, testified to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> investigating committees in 1987 under a grant of limited immunity. The immunity grant meant the congressional testimony itself could not be used to prosecute <PERSON> North </PERSON>, although independent counsel <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> was free to develop the same information independently. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial on charges of lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, shredding evidence and conspiring to commit tax fraud comes after intense publicity, and the judge said the spotlight will remain on throughout the trial. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he will rule Wednesday on how much exposure to such publicity ought to be allowed before a possible juror is disqualified. North himself has contributed to the attention his trial is receiving. In recent months, he has been giving speeches for $ 20,000 fees. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has made it clear that pretrial publicity is not necessarily fatal to a fair trial. The justices' most recent ruling on the issue was in 1984 when, by a 6-2 vote, they reinstated the murder conviction of a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> high school teacher for raping and strangling a student. The court stressed in that case that the conviction came years after the offense occurred, allowing ample time for the community's sense of outrage to cool Justice <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, writing for the court, said the trial judge has broad discretion to decide whether prospective jurors are biased. `` Under our system it is that judge who is best situated to determine competency to serve impartially,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. The high court in 1961 provided some guidelines for permissible pretrial publicity. Justice <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, writing for the court then, said it is not necessary for jurors to `` be totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved.'' He said requiring them to know nothing would amount to an `` impossible'' standard.

 Ranchers armed with blankets and shovels helped more than 100 firefighters battle a prairie fire that raced through the Panhandle Tuesday, consuming 8,000 acres of grassland, farm buildings and at least one home. Firefighters said a 25-foot wall of flames was fueled by winds gusting in excess of 45 mph as it made its way across <PERSON> Morrill </PERSON> and Garden counties for more than eight hours into Tuesday night. No injuries were reported. Some hot spots were still burning late Tuesday night, but authorities said the fire was under control by about 8:30 p.m. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Loxterkamp </PERSON>, <PERSON> Broadwater </PERSON>'s assistant fire chief, said minimal damage was reported because few buildings exist in the area. `` This is all ranch country.

<HEAD>Advertisers Unfairly Targeted in War on Drunken Driving, Groups Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 There is no proven link between alcoholic beverage advertising and drunkenness, say broadcasters and advertisers who contend they're being made scapegoats in the war on drunken driving. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION>, along with major advertising industry groups and alcoholic beverage makers, on Tuesday said recommendations by a <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Surgeon General's workshop that restrictions be placed on alcohol ads were a well-meaning but constitutionally unsupportable attack on commercial speech. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertising </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> said the workshop recommendations `` are clearly unconstitutional and discriminatory because of a lack of evidence showing any link between alcoholic beverage advertising and consumption, let alone abuse.'' `` We're really concerned that censorship of truthful advertising is contagious, and we would be on a slippery slope, and all sorts of product advertising would come under fire,'' <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said. Restricting ads does not get at the root causes of drunkenness _ a problem that must be approached by expanded public education, the groups said. At a news conference, industry representatives attacked the recommendations presented to Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> in December by a workshop on drunken driving. The broadcasters and advertisers said they were writing to <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> to urge him, as one official put it, to reject `` these hasty and misguided proposals.'' The NAB and the advertising industry declined to participate in the workshop last year, claiming it was stacked against advertisers' interests Advertising of alcoholic beverages on radio and television totaled $ 931 million in 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> NAB </ORGANIZATION> said. The industry representatives Tuesday said they stood ready to increase their campaigns against alcohol abuse. <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said he hoped <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> would recognize the anti-drunkenness efforts being made by the advertising industry and `` not to get into a confrontational mode but to try to solve this problem by talking.'' `` Banning alcohol advertising and marketing will have no effect on the drunk driving problem other than to provide false satisfaction that something is being done,'' NAB President <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fritts </PERSON> said in a statement. `` Research shows that the first step toward solving the tragedy of drunk driving is to make drunkenness socially unacceptable,'' <PERSON> Fritts </PERSON> said. `` Attempts to scapegoat any one element of society are counterproductive and, in the workshop's case, totally without merit.'' However, the presidential <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drunk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Driving </ORGANIZATION> reported in December that teen-agers testified during public hearings `` with near unanimity'' that advertising encourages adolescents to drink. The commission said drunken driving was the No. 1 killer of teens. The federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> said 23,632 people were killed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1987 in vehicular accidents in which alcohol was involved. The workshop's recommendations to <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> included banning alcohol ads and promotion and sponsorship of public events where the majority of the audience is under the legal drinking age; elimination of advertising that portrays activities that are combined with alcohol use; banning sponsorship of athletic events by the alcoholic beverage industry; and blocking the use of celebrities who have a strong appeal to young people in alcohol advertising and promotion. <ORGANIZATION> NAB </ORGANIZATION> representative <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> NAB </ORGANIZATION> had recommended to <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> that: _ Broadcasting's ongoing public service announcements campaign `` should be broadened and developed to make the public aware that getting drunk is socially unacceptable. _ An education campaign should be developed to explain the difference between taking a drink and getting drunk _ Individuals `` can and should be trained and educated to recognize an impending intoxication in others _ and trained to intervene effectively. _ `` Families must be taught that education about drinking practices begins at home.'' _ Incentives should be promoted to encourage anti-drunkenness efforts <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> would have no immediate comment on the comments by the broadcasters and advertisers. He said <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> would review the panel's recommendations and public comments and then issue his own views

<HEAD>1989 Begins with Higher Prices Received by Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's farmers began 1989 on a price upswing that saw them receiving more for their cattle, hogs, tomatoes and wheat, according to preliminary January figures by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. On the average, prices that farmers got for raw products increased 1.4 percent from December to January, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday As always, there were losers as well as gainers, with grapefruit, oranges, peanuts and strawberries commanding lower prices. But even so, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s overall price index was up 12 percent from a year earlier. New quarterly figures showed prices paid by farmers to meet expenses rose 1.2 percent from October and averaged 6.1 percent more than a year ago. Higher prices for feeder stock, including pigs and cattle, along with higher calf prices accounted for most of the rise since last fall. In a related report, the board said preliminary figures showed last year's corn production, which was shriveled nearly a third by drought and heat, had a value of more than $ 13 billion, an average of $ 2.60 per bushel. That was down from almost $ 14 billion in 1987, when the crop averaged only $ 1.94 per bushel. The value is <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s estimate of how much a crop is worth, whether a farmer sells it for cash or feeds it to livestock. Soybeans were valued at almost $ 11.9 billion, an average of $ 7.70 per bushel, compared with $ 11.3 billion and $ 5.88 in 1987. Wheat was third at $ 6.63 billion and $ 3.70 per bushel, compared with a 1987 value of $ 5.5 billion and $ 2.57 per bushel. According to the preliminary January price figures, based mostly on midmonth averages, the index for livestock and livestock products as a group rose 1.9 percent from their December average and was up 6.8 percent from January 1988. The department's all-crops price index for January rose 0.7 percent from December and was up 20 percent from a year earlier. Prices of food grains were up 3.2 percent from December. Wheat prices rose 14 cents per bushel from December to $ 4.08 in January, the highest since March 1981. Rice dropped 8 cents per 100 pounds to $ 6.52 per hundredweight. Prices of commercial vegetables rose 8.2 percent from December, with tomatoes and sweet corn leading the increase. The all-fruit price index dropped 6.8 percent from December but still averaged 16.2 percent more than in January 1988. Oranges dropped to $ 6.20 per box from $ 6.50 in December but were up from $ 5.64 a year earlier. <PERSON> Grapefruit </PERSON> declined to $ 3.72 per box from $ 4.71 in December and $ 5.63 in January 1988. Although the projections are subject to change, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> economists say that net cash income of farmers may be in the range of $ 48 billion to $ 58 billion this year, compared with a near-record of $ 57 billion in 1988. That is the difference between cash receipts and cash expenses during the calendar year. Department economists say cash expenses are expected to rise moderately in 1989 with expanded crop acreages and costlier production items. Food prices in 1988 rose an average of about 3.7 percent, and <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> analysts say another increase of 3 percent to 5 percent is likely in 1989.

 <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ An <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> survey shows that wind damage to land in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> is up sharply from the relatively moderate losses of a year ago, mostly because of the 1988 drought. Wilson Scaling, chief of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Soil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday nearly 2.2 million acres were reported damaged in November and December, up more than 80 percent from 1.2 million acres in the same two months of 1987. `` A lot of the damage is a result of drought,'' Scaling said. `` The reasons vary by area, but major factors are lack of -LRB- crop -RRB- residue and poor vegetative cover _ both caused by a lack of moisture.'' Scaling said more than 80 percent of the land reported damaged was cropland, the remainder primarily rangeland. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> accounted for more than 30 percent of the erosion damage in November and December with 664,128 acres. Scaling said that in addition to the damaged land in November and December, nearly 19 million acres were `` in condition to blow,'' with five months still remaining in the critical wind season. November and December are the first two months of an annual seven-month season when winds are highest and the soils are driest in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>. Surveys were made in 541 counties of the 10-state region. Although the 1987-88 season began with relatively light damage, it picked up as moisture conditions worsened. When the season ended last May 31, more than 13 million acres had been damaged, the second-largest acreage since <ORGANIZATION> SCS </ORGANIZATION> began records in 1935. The most widespread was in 1955 when about 16 million acres of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> land were damaged by wind. Another bad year was 1980-81 when 12.5 million acres were damaged. According to the survey, the state-by-state breakdown comparing damaged acres in November and December with the damage during the same two months of 1987-88, included: _ <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, 28,795 acres damaged this season and 17,070 in 1987-88 _ <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, 135,550 and 31,520 _ <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, 510,875 and 304,023 _ <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, 54,405 and 74,590 _ <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, 51,100 and 3,300 _ <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, 188,200 and 230,000 _ <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, 68,480 and 31,288 _ <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, 112,250 and 69,400 _ <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, 664,128 and 250,220 _ <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, 346,754 and 190,885

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will put off legislation tightening congressional control over covert intelligence actions and instead rely on the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's good faith to keep lawmakers informed about such activity, says Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> made the offer Tuesday to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s new secretary of state, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, at a meeting designed to open doors to the administration and lay the groundwork for bipartisan cooperation on foreign policy. In return, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> promised him that the administration `` will abide by the letter and the spirit of the law'' that requires the president to give <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> timely notice of planned covert actions overseas. That law has been a sore point in congressional-administration relations, especially since the Iran-Contra affair, when President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> failed for more than 10 months to tell <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> designed to win freedom for American hostages. `` It was the intent of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that ` timely' should mean hours, or days at most, not weeks or months,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. Legislation that grew out of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' Iran-Contra investigation was introduced last year to erase the law's ambiguity over what constitutes `` timely'' notice by placing a firm 48-hour notification requirement on the president. The bill's primary sponsor, Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, said he had no problem with <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s pledge so long as the White House voluntarily honors the 48-hour standard in all but the most extreme circumstances where notice is impossible. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed the measure last year, but it was pulled from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> calendar late in the year after <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> ran into accusations that he had improperly publicly disclosed a covert <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> operation in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee inquiry into <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s conduct remains open. `` There is no point in opening old wounds if we can start afresh and act on a mutual assumption of good faith,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> also set up a bipartisan task force to meet with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and arrange regular consultation between the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on foreign policy matters, trying to head off the confrontations that dogged relations between <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House. The task force he created includes <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Fascell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Beilenson </PERSON>, D-Calif. Republican members are to be appointed by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>. Their job will be to meet with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> periodically to find ways to build trust and overcome longstanding disputes with the executive branch, including the circumstances under which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces will be deployed and the notification issue in covert operations cases He said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is seeking a mechanism by which the two branches can work out diputes over the War Powers Act and avoid the constitutional collision over congressional and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> authority that can occur when the president deploys <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops. `` We've begun a process which may be constructive,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, one which he hopes will `` reduce the level of confrontation that has sometimes marred our relationships in the past couple of years.''

 An unwed couple expecting their third child `` are creating children for the welfare rolls,'' a federal judge said in blocking their request to overturn an agency's ban on housing unmarried couples. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagueux </PERSON> also suggested that <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Dagnese </PERSON> leave the family so that <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Arsenau </PERSON> and the children could meet the <ORGANIZATION> Woonsocket </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>'s regulation, said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> chapter. The couple, who have lived together six years, filed a federal lawsuit two weeks ago saying the authority's decision to deny them emergency housing violated their rights to `` freedom of association, family privacy and equal protection of laws.'' The couple were seeking a preliminary injuction Tuesday. No trial date has been set. `` Under our policy, boyfriends are not allowed, and they are not part of the family,'' said <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Lafond </PERSON>, the housing authority's executive director The agency's attorney argued that the couple could neither show a husband and wife, nor a common-law relationship, said <PERSON> Lafond </PERSON>. But it was <PERSON> Lagueux </PERSON> who said the relationship was adulterous and against the state's public policy, according to <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> chapter is assisting the couple. `` Here is a couple in an illicit relationship, who are creating children for the welfare rolls, while others who qualify for housing are shunted aside,'' the judge said Tuesday. `` Would n't the court look silly asking the authority to foster these people and allow them to continue an illegal relationship?'' <PERSON> Dagnese </PERSON>, who has been separated from his wife for almost a decade, is awaiting completion of his divorce, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. They have a 3-year-old daughter and a year-old son and are expecting a child in March. `` I have to tell my kids that this is not their father because we're not married?'' <PERSON> Arsenau </PERSON> asked. `` They're still his kids and he's still their father.'' `` There's no difference. You're still together,'' <PERSON> Dagnese </PERSON> said. `` The only difference is a piece of paper.'' The couple was ordered to leave their rented apartment Dec. 15 because of safety hazards in the building, said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. The agency denied them emergency shelter soon thereafter. <PERSON> Arsenau </PERSON> had the opportunity to request an informal hearing to discuss the situation or to complain to a formal grievance panel after her application was rejected, but did neither, the housing agency director said. <PERSON> Arsenau </PERSON>, who is bedridden because of her pregnancy, testified she and the children have been sleeping in the living room of a friend's apartment <PERSON> Dagnese </PERSON>, who recently lost his job with a dairy company, usually sleeps in his car or with other friends, she said.

 Several major campaign promises by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> are likely to be missing or significantly scaled back in the budget proposal he will make to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> next week, administration officials say. Campaign pledges for a major expansion of Medicaid and increased funding for several education programs are among those likely to fall victim to concern about the federal deficit, said the officials, who spoke Tuesday on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does plan to propose several tax breaks, the officials said, but the scope of a proposed capital-gains rate cut remains undecided. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has long advocated a reduction in the capital gains tax _ the tax on profits from the sale of homes, stocks and other assets _ to a maximum of 15 percent. But senior aides said <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> officials are having a hard time coming up with a formula, and the final proposal could call for lower rates for one category than for another. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign promises on education including a $ 500 million National Merit scholarship program, an expansion of the Head Start program and a $ 50 million increase in school experimentation may be pruned back considerably, the officials said. They also said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign proposal to expand Medicaid coverage to more lower-income Americans and to allow low-paid workers to purchase it is being given a low priority in budget preparation talks. Budget constraints make fulfillment of such promises unlikely, the officials said. `` The two have to be reconciled,'' said a senior White House official who insisted upon anonymity. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has promised to propose a budget that does not contain a tax increase while meeting the Gramm-Rudman law requirement for reducing the deficit to $ 100 billion or less. The officials said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget, to be unveiled Feb. 9 when he addresses a joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, will include these proposals: _ A child-care tax credit of up to $ 1,000 per child for low-income families, generally those earning less than $ 10,000 a year _ New tax incentives for oil and gas exploration, likely coupled with a call for removal of all remaining price controls on natural gas, now affecting about 40 percent of production _ A proposal for tax-free `` enterprise zones'' to be established in some inner city areas to promote commercial growth, a program championed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nominee for Housing and <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> secretary, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> Administration officials are still wrestling with terms of a package to help bail out troubled savings and loans, and it appeared likely that some variation on a proposal for an increased fee for deposit insurance would be part of the new <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> budget plan. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself has said that a proposal for a reduced capital-gains tax rate will be part of his Feb. 9 rewrite of the $ 1.15 trillion budget President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> submitted last month for fiscal 1990. However, sources say there is still disagreement over exactly what form the tax cut should take. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other advocates of a lower capital gains tax say it would boost the economy by increasing business investment. Opponents say it would be a tax break for the rich that also would worsen the federal deficit. Capital gains are currently taxed at the same level as other income, at 15 percent, 28 percent or 33 percent, depending on overall income. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would like to lower the rate to a flat 15 percent. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> claims that, instead of costing the government money, such a move would spur investment and generate up to $ 4 billion a year in new revenue. However, many leading economists, including the bipartisan <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, say lowering the tax would have the opposite effect _ reducing revenues and further worsening the deficit. That's because some capital gains _ such as the profits raised from the sale of private homes or objects of art _ are unlikely to be funneled into business investment. Under existing law, homeowners can generally escape the capital gains tax by plowing their profits into another home, and there is a one-time exemption from the tax for homeowners over age 55.

<HEAD>Memory of Ill Son Led to 40 Years of Help for Children's Hospital</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A father's memory of being worried sick about his injured son but too poor to pay the hospital bill inspired a newspaper column that has raised millions of dollars over the past 40 years to help care for needy youngsters. The father _ and the columnist _ was <ORGANIZATION> Bill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. He is now 76 and retired, missing one kidney and forbidden to smoke his beloved cigars after open-heart surgery. `` God, I miss'em,'' he says. But Gold still likes to tell funny stories, and he still cherishes his favorite charity. He and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Levey </PERSON>, who succeeded Gold in writing the daily column eight years ago, were hosts at a thank-you party Tuesday night for some of the thousands of readers who answered their appeals for donations to Children's Hospital over the years. Among the guests was <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Biermann </PERSON> of suburban <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, who spent five months in the hospital in 1964-65 as a 13-year-old undergoing extensive brain surgery. <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON>, who is confined to a wheelchair, recently mailed <PERSON> Levey </PERSON> a $ 7 check, `` which I hope will help in a small way.'' Also at the party was <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, 8, who will undergo his 15th operation at Children's next Monday for multiple birth defects. `` We've spent our life savings on surgery,'' said his mother, <PERSON> Dianna </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> of Silver Spring, Md. `` If we ever get him through this, we'll contribute freely. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> say the private, non-profit facility in northeast <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> provides $ 25 million in free medical care each year to children whose parents are too poor to pay the full costs of treatment. Without $ 4.5 million in voluntary donations last year, officials said, the hospital would have shown a deficit. Gold's column, `` The District Line,'' a chronicle of hometown happenings that never make Page One, first appeared in the Post on Jan. 13, 1947. Not long afterward, a woman wrote to advertise some giveaway pets and enclosed a dollar `` for your favorite charity.'' Gold searched the city for a worthy cause. He said he was impressed by <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, partly because it was chartered in 1860 _ before the Civil War _ to provide medical care for `` indigent children of every race and creed.'' <PERSON> Gold </PERSON> said he recalled an earlier time, when he was the hungry young news director of a <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> radio station and rushed his 2-year-old son to the local children's hospital. It was so dilapidated it had been condemned by the fire marshal, he said. Standing in the similar disrepair of Children's Hospital 40 years ago, <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> said, `` it was very easy to remember when I did n't have two quarters to rub together and was afraid my kid had a fractured skull. It made me feel that this is where I belong.'' The column has raised some $ 6 million for the hospital since then. Looking back, <PERSON> Gold </PERSON> said he'd make the same choice today. `` I know of no other place where they take the child first, make sure he's cared for, and then ask the parents whether they can pay,'' he said. Although he's on `` everybody's sucker list'' and must turn down some charitable appeals, <PERSON> Gold </PERSON> said `` it's very difficult to say I need this money more than Children's Hospital. Anyone who ca n't respond to the needs of sick children is a pretty sad character.

 Authorities have discovered the bodies of six people who were shot in the head with a shotgun near a trailer compound, and one of the residents has been charged with two of the deaths. The body of a man found Tuesday in the rusted hull of a car in a junkyard near the three-trailer compound appeared to have been shot twice in the back of the head at close range, said Assistant State Medical Examiner Dr. <PERSON> Vasudeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kshirsagar </PERSON>. The condition of the body indicated that the victim had been dead several months, <PERSON> Kshirsagar </PERSON> said, adding that the five others appeared to have been killed in a similar manner. `` It was a shotgun. It was consistent with the other cases,'' said <LOCATION> Kanawha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>. Police believe the body is that of 20-year-old <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schillings </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, who came to the compound to live last spring and was reported missing last summer. On Monday, the body of 22-year-old <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> was found on the site about 30 feet from the car, authorities said. The junkyard is about 200 yards east of the compound, where the first two bodies were discovered Jan. 8. If all six bodies are linked to the same killer, it would be the worst series of deaths in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> attributed to the same person. Authorities said 19-year-old <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Southern </PERSON> <PERSON> McCallister </PERSON> is being held without bond on charges of murdering brothers <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanson </PERSON>, who lived with <PERSON> McCallister </PERSON> at the compound in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Albans </LOCATION>, a town of 15,000 people 15 miles west of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. Prosecutors said <PERSON> McCallister </PERSON> has confessed to the brothers' murders Police found the body of the Sansons' sister, <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON>, at an abandoned motel across the street from the compound on Jan. 21. Another victim, <PERSON> McCallister </PERSON>'s grandmother, <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, 69, was found in her nearby home. `` We hope this ight wrap up the investigation from the standpoint of looking for people,'' <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> said. The sheriff's department declined to say whether <PERSON> McCallister </PERSON> would be charged in the other deaths or to speculate on a motive. However, authorities said all the victims lived at the compound, which is now abandoned, and Price and Schillings had dated <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON>.

 A man who got stuck inside a church chimney died slowly as his body cooked during a two-day period, police said. `` We do n't know if he suffocated from carbon monoxide or if the heat got to him. The heat could have gotten to between 1,200 and 1,500 degrees, so it had to have been a horrifying death,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Andress </PERSON>. `` His body did n't burn.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is naming Undersecretary of State <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where he will grapple with touchy trade and defense issues. <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON>, 51, is the highest-ranking foreign service officer in the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. If confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, he will succeed <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leader who was the ambassador for a record 11 years before retiring last November at age 85. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s selection of <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> was confirmed Tuesday by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who declined to be identified, after reports of the pending nomination circulated in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Three other diplomatic selections also surfaced: <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> for the sensitive job of Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> to be Undersecretary of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON> to be <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> is a Democrat who broke with the majority of his party to support <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the Nicaraguan rebels. <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> is currently assigned to the Inter-American bureau. <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON>, deputy national security adviser, was a candidate to succeed <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON>. <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> is a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and was the ranking Asian specialist on the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff in 1978-1979, during the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration. He has held a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> post as well, serving as deputy assistant secretary of defense in 1979-80. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> are at a crucial stage, with pressure building in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to have the Japanese increase their contribution to the country's defense. Another problem in the relationship is the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit of $ 57 billion caused by an influx of Japanese products. Under former Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> played a key role in dealing with Soviet authorities on regional disputes in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. And <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON>, in a memorandum to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> on July 2, 1986, counseled him to oppose former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s surreptitious plan to send <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in an effort to free American hostages. `` This seems scarcely a propitious moment to send arms to <LOCATION> Teheran </LOCATION> and it has never been clear the Iranians we are dealing with are going to possess any clout in a post-Khomeini <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> wrote. An imposing 6-footer, <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> has a quiet demeanor and low-key style. Twenty years ago, he served in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> as a visiting professor of international relations at the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and from 1972 to 1974 he was a special assistant in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy there. <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> is a graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Carleton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He is married and has three children. He is expected to be succeeded in the job of undersecretary of state for political affairs by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimmet </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is breaking precedent by not naming a career diplomat to the No. 3 job at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, but <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>, a former foreign service officer with 37 years' experience, is to be nominated Deputy Secretary of State. <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> is a former ambassador to the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and has politically conservative views. <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON>, on the other hand, is a Democrat who shifted from skepticism about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the Contra rebels to supporting the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's program. A Democratic <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> source, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said the choice had been made because <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> was a moderate who could appeal to both Democrats and Republicans on divisive Central American policies, and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in particular. <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> would succeed <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> in the post. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> was an ardent champion of the Contras who clashed with Democrats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> over what many considered to be misleading testimony about the secret <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> program to finance the Nicaraguan rebels with funds solicited from foreign governments. Meanwhile, a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> source said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was expected to name <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON> ambassador to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON>, a former ambassador to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, also has served in a variety of foreign posts, including in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>.

 Turks and Germans nod politely to each other on the streets of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s predominantly <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> neighborhood, but a current of mistrust sometimes runs beneath the outer friendliness. That uneasiness seems to have intensified now that a far-right party which suggests foreigners do not belong in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has won seats in the city's legislature _ its first electoral victory on the state level. Turks and other non-Germans living in this city are worried by the Republicans' sudden emergence as a serious political party. `` The Republicans did not win so many seats in the legislature, but we are very concerned they could become stronger in the future,'' said <PERSON> Zafer </PERSON> <PERSON> Oeztuerk </PERSON>, a university student from <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> has a reputation for a liberal attitude toward the non-Germans who stream into the city, and many Berliners took to the streets to express dismay after the Republicans captured 7.5 percent of Sunday's vote, or 11 of the legislature's 134 seats. An estimated 15,000 people protested outside City Hall on Monday, demanding the outlawing of the 5-year-old party, whose national chairman is former <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> SS soldier <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoenhuber </PERSON>. Many conservative West Berliners, however, say they have nothing against foreigners but believe it unfair to give non-Germans jobs and apartments when the city has a housing shortage and 11 percent unemployment. Analysts think the Republicans were able to pick up so many votes because the governing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> have failed to address their conservative constituents' concerns about the growing number of foreigners _ mostly Turks _ who are competing with Germans for jobs, housing and social services. `` It appears that the vote for the Republicans was more of a protest vote,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoess </PERSON>, a political scientist at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> told the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgenpost </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. An estimated 262,000 foreigners live in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, a city of 2 million residents surrounded by <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. More than half are Turks. Many of the Turks live in Southeast 36, a section of the huge working-class <LOCATION> Kreuzberg </LOCATION> district that a visitor might mistake for <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION> if not for the German cars and tavern signs advertising local beers. Women draped in traditional shawls ply the sidewalk outside drab shops and ethnic food stores, bantering with clerks and customers in Turkish. Turks who live in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> say they were shocked when they heard the Republicans had won seats in the legislature, and angrily defend their right to live in the city. `` We could n't believe this happened,'' said <PERSON> Tuncay </PERSON> <PERSON> Yueksel </PERSON>, who runs a Turkish bakery. `` I am a German, and so are my wife and children. We belong here,'' he said in fluent German. <PERSON> Yueksel </PERSON> said Germans and Turks live alongside each other in Southeast 36 and get along well, a feeling echoed by a German man at a neighborhood cafe. But a middle-aged German grocer said `` there are too many foreigners'' She said she had voted for the Republicans. `` This neighborhood was once all German, but they started moving out when Turks started moving in. We've become foreigners here, in our own neighborhood,'' she said. `` Look, I am certainly not a Nazi, and the Republicans are not Nazis either. I was only a child when <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> was in power, but I know those were bad times,'' said the woman. `` But the Republicans were saying the right things. It's not right when foreigners collect social assistance that we provide with our taxes.'' The woman refused to give her name, saying, `` That could be bad for my business.'' The election has unified <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s non-Germans. `` I think it's really odd that so many conservative Germans travel to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> for their vacations, get their suntans and then return home saying the Turks have to go,'' said <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Assal </PERSON>, a young Egyptian taxi driver. He also rejected suggestions that foreigners are stealing jobs from Germans: `` The foreigners who come here have to take jobs the Germans do n't want,'' said <PERSON> Assal </PERSON>. `` It's rare that you find Germans lining up for work as maids, dishwashers and domestic servants. Those jobs are left to the foreigners.''

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is trying to finance its reforms with loans from the West while postponing tough decisions needed at home to curb its budget deficit, says the author of a new book on the Soviet economy. Author <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON> has joined a chorus of skeptics, including many on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, who worry that Western banks and governments are extending credits to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> without reviewing the strategic implications. <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON>'s new book, `` The Coming Soviet Crash: <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s Desperate Pursuit of Credit in Western Financial Markets,'' includes a detailed analysis of published Soviet budget data She concluded that <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> accountants have been fudging the country's economic figures for years, steadily reporting budget surpluses when in fact there were growing deficits. The Soviets finally admitted to a budget deficit last October. The foremost spokesman in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the issue, Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, has cautioned that giving the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> easy credits could undercut <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests and harm rather than help the reforms of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Nevertheless, said <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON>, under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> the Soviets have turned increasingly to the West for financing. As part of the reforms, the Soviets are publishing many previously secret economic statistics, but <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON> and others question the data. One respected Soviet economist, for example, has said the deficit is three times higher than the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has acknowledged. Last August, in a prospectus for its first foreign bond issue, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> government said it had a budget surplus, putting the figure at 3 billion rubles, or $ 1.8 billion. `` It was revealed three months later that the Soviets had been running a deficit for years,'' <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON> said. The revelation, she said, did not prompt a protest from the Swiss bank that sponsored the loan or from those who bought the issue. The continued cloudiness of Soviet financial figures does not augur well for the West as the Soviets seek to join such Western financial institutions as the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, which require `` transparent'' reporting in which no numbers are hidden, <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s onslaught of financial maneuvers seems to have left the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> dazed,'' sh wrote. Although the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has increased its international borrowing, the credits do not come close to covering the deficit, meaning that the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> has simply printed more money to cover the gap. Prices remain under government control, however, disguising or at least postponing an inflationary spiral. And, <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON> said in a <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> presentation this week, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has not taken one of the major promised steps of his `` perestroika'' campaign to restructure the Soviet economy, a price reform that would eliminate subsidies on many commodities. For the West, the greatest concern is that the Soviets are borrowing money abroad while postponing tough political decisions at home. `` The correlation between <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reign in the Kremlin and the escalation of Soviet borrowing activities in Western financial markets is striking,'' wrote <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON>, a researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> Hoover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Within two years after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took power in March 1985, Soviet debt to the West shot up from about $ 25 billion to over $ 37 billion, an increase of 50 percent,'' she wrote. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, in a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> column on Jan. 6, cautioned that `` the notion that Western governments can help Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> through cheap credit is ... flawed.'' `` Reform means making tough choices _ butter not weapons, efficiency not useless output, consumption not forced saving. The real reformers know this. They also know it means higher prices, less job security and harder work today in exchange for the promise of a better life tomorrow,'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said. Continuing shortages of basic goods and revelations about the Soviet budget deficit have tempered optimism about that better life. Soviet Finance Minister <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gostev </PERSON> last October estimated the budget deficit at 35 billion rubles, about $ 58 billion at current exchange rates. Another well-known Soviet economist, <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON>, last week said that the actual deficit was nearly three times <PERSON> Gostev </PERSON>'s estimate, about $ 165 billion, or 11 percent of the gross national product By comparison, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government deficit runs at about 4 percent of GNP. Other Soviet officials have been more optimistic. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Korolev </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>, wrote in Pravda on Monday that the GNP grew 5 percent last year and was 13.3 percent higher than in 1985. The government announced this month that Soviet GNP in 1988 totaled 866 billion rubles, or $ 1.4 trillion. That was less than half of the 1985 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GNP </ORGANIZATION> of $ 3.8 trillion.

 An American ballet premier, scheduled for the third night of the Feld Ballet's Jan. 31 to March 12 season, was pushed up to opening night because of an injury to a dancer. So the Joyce Theater audience on Tuesday saw `` Petipa Notwithstanding,'' choreographed by <PERSON> Eliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Feld </PERSON> to composer <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>'s 1964 `` In C.'' The minimalist music set the dancers to relentless motion and had a physical effect on this viewer, too. The throat closed and nails were chewed. Stages of viewing went from admiration for the dancers' skill and stamina to a wish for it to end The dancers, in white leotards with black lines and dots, did n't look like people To a steady 4-4 beat, they began moving across the stage, heads dangling forward like rag dolls. The music changed to clang-clang, first heard over bells then over a drone, and the dancers reached up and out, to draw air toward themselves, like robots on a fantasy assembly line. The choreography followed the music. When the beat was fast, the dancers were frantic. But even when the men were jumping up in unison and scrabbling under their armpits, there was something static about the whole thing. <PERSON> Marius </PERSON> <PERSON> Petipa </PERSON>, choreographer of `` The Sleeping Beauty,'' mentioned in the title, is considered the originator of classical ballet. Arts need to move forward and modern music must surely inspire choreographers in new directions. This viewer, who found `` Petipa Notwithstanding'' neither attractive nor exciting, is n't appreciating this new direction yet <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemanski </PERSON>, one of six dancers scheduled for `` Intermezzo No. 1,'' sustained a lower back injury, causing that dance to be replaced. The evening began with <PERSON> Feld </PERSON>'s 1970 `` The Consort.'' It begins in a courtly way and moves into earthier peasant fare. The women tuck up their skirts. The men change fitted jackets for homespun and toss the women in the air and down in a dance that becomes quite sexy just before the curtain falls. It ended with <PERSON> Feld </PERSON>'s 1986 `` Skara Brae'' set to traditional Scottish, Irish and <PERSON> Breton </PERSON> airs. Following its season at the <ORGANIZATION> Joyce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Feld </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ballet </ORGANIZATION> company will perform in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Storrs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Hempstead </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, N.H; <LOCATION> Orono </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Easton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A bipartisan federal commission that must come up with ways to cut the government's $ 150-billion-a-year deficits is finding agreement out of its grasp even with the deadline for producing a final report just four weeks away. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which met Tuesday, indicated that Republicans were differing over a draft proposal some of their members were circulating, and that Democrats might end up filing their own report. `` I think it's going to be very hard for us to agree on anything, without going to jail,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Minn </LOCATION>., a commission member and ranking <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> lawmaker on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON> was referring to a court ruling issued earlier this month that ordered the 14-member commission to hold its sessions in public. Many panel members have complained that without closed-door meetings, it has become hard to discuss politically touchy subjects such as new taxes or spending cuts. Former Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, appointed to the commission by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said Republican staff aides had composed a plan that embraced <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s flexible freeze _ limiting spending increases to the rate of inflation while requiring no new taxes. He would not discuss the specific program changes advanced in the plan. <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> said he liked the idea. And <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> co-chairman of the panel, predicted that ultimately, <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> and the panel's seven Republicans would `` support the flexible freeze as drawn up by the president.'' Others said no such majority consensus was in sight. Panel member Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters, `` The implication that Republicans are unanimously behind something I do n't think is true.'' And <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, the Democratic lawyer who co-chairs the commission with <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, said there are `` substantial differences'' among Republicans. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> also said a minority on the panel might put out a dissenting report. `` I would think there's a good chance that might be the case,'' <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> said after Tuesday's meeting. The views expressed Tuesday made it seem ever less likely that the panel, created in late 1987 to find a bipartisan, long-range solution to the government's colossal red ink problem, would accomplish its goal. Tuesday's hour-long session focused on the nation's savings and loan crisis, and on the multi-billion dollar surpluses built up each year for future Social Security benefits. Critics say the Social Security surpluses are making the deficit appear smaller than it really is. Earlier this month, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> told the commission to have its report ready by March 1, rather than six months later as the law establishing the panel would have allowed. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> advanced his flexible freeze plan during the presidential election campaign. Under the proposal, overall federal spending increases would be held to the rate of inflation, with increases in some programs and reductions in others. With the booming economy <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> predicts, government revenues would grow at an even faster rate and the budget would be balanced in a few years without tax increases, he has said. Critics have argued that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s expectations for the economy are too optimistic, and chided him for not mentioning specifically which programs would face cuts.

<HEAD>US Expects Rebels to Lay Siege to Kabul After Soviets Withdraw</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Afghan rebels are likely to lay siege to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> after the last Soviet troops quit <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and could bring the pro-Moscow government down within weeks, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official says. The `` choke'em'' tactics are designed to force the city's defenders to surrender or to defect once their Soviet military support is gone, the official said Tuesday In the past few weeks, the Soviets have bombed rebel positions throughout the country, partly in an attempt to keep the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> dispersed and to protect a continuing convoy of food and fuel supplies to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. `` When the last Soviet soldier steps across the border they know in their heart of hearts it's going to unravel,'' said the official, who spoke only on condition he would not be identified. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, already burdened by more than 1 million refugees from the provinces, has only enough fuel and food to last for a few days, the official said. The rebels, who will continue to receive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms through <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, plan to keep `` tightening the noose'' around <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and other urban centers, using a `` siege magnified'' strategy, the official said. The aim is to try to persuade the city's defenders to surrender or to defect, but many of them are `` of the hard-core type,'' including members of the <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> secret police, and will stay and fight because there is little chance of amnesty, the official said. `` So it will be difficult,'' he said. `` The crystal ball is murky. At one time we were talking of them lasting 6 to 12 months, and then 3 to 6 months. Estimates vary. But it's going to be sooner rather than later. `` If that strangle effect works, and I see no reason why it should not, the government could unravel very quickly, in a matter of weeks, not months.'' The Soviet troops are departing under a Feb. 15 deadline set in the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords of last April. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Monday accused the Soviets of engaging in a `` scorched earth policy'' of bombing rebel positions as the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> exits. The official said the Soviets claim to be retaliating for a rebel blockade of food and fuel convoys, but were bombing positions as far away as 30 miles to the east of the main supply route. `` So far as we can tell, the resistance has been fairly restrained about interfering with supplies,'' he said. `` There has been some interdiction, but not to the extent that the Soviets suggest.'' However, the official said, `` the interference is going to grow if they do n't quit this stupidity.'' He said one aim of the bombing, missile and artillery attacks is to punish <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Massoud </PERSON>, a rebel leader in the <LOCATION> Panjsher </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> east of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, who has refused to promise not to interdict food and fuel shipments to the capital. Most of the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> leaders agreed last November under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure to permit the Soviets to depart without interference. `` By taking this bombing action, the Soviets run the risk of the resistance not letting them withdraw more or less in peace,'' the official said. With tensions rising, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> closed on Monday and the remaining diplomats and security guards were flown out of the country. One reason, he said, was to prevent Afghan officials from seeking asylum there as political refugees. On the other hand, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> are consider an application from former Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghaffar </PERSON> <PERSON> Lakanwal </PERSON>, who defected last November on a trip to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Last week, the official said, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sent a formal note to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> instructing them to deny visas to anyone attached to the pro-Moscow government of President <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 An Argentine supply ship that ran aground off <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> sank Tuesday in heavy seas and high winds, the government said, and there was concern oil in its hold could leak and damage the environment. The sinking of the 400-foot <ORGANIZATION> Bahia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paraiso </ORGANIZATION> followed warnings from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> that the unspoiled <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> could face ecological disaster if the 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel aboard the ship were to spill. No injuries were reported in the sinking. Tourists aboard and the crew had been evacuated from the vessel, which was 600 miles south of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION>, the tip of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Salvage efforts had been hampered by 50 mph winds. The double-hulled oceanographic ship sank at about 10 p.m., the government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Telam </ORGANIZATION> said, citing a navy communique. <ORGANIZATION> Telam </ORGANIZATION> did not say whether the ship broke up or if diesel oil spilled when it went down. The depth of the water in which the ship sank was not immediately known. The ship had been carrying supplies including jet fuel, gasoline and canisters of compressed gases to the Argentine Esperanza station near the tip of the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement released in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The ship ran aground Saturday about two miles from <LOCATION> Palmer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> research facility on the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, the continent's tip. It sustained a 35-foot-long gash in its hull, and some of the 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel began leaking, washing ashore near <LOCATION> Palmer </LOCATION> station. The fuel killed some krill, a tiny shrimp-like creature that is a vital part of the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> food chain, and has affected penguins, sea gulls and giant petrel birds, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> statement said. There were no immediate details about the extent of damage to the wildlife in the pristine surroundings. Agency spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Renerie </PERSON> said Tuesday before the ship sank that the leak, which was threatening penguins and other wildlife, had stopped. `` Scientists are concerned that some research search projects may already have been affected by the leak,'' a foundation statement said. It said two Argentine salvage vessels were expected to arrive Thursday or Friday. Before the sinking, Argentine officials had discounted a spill. <ORGANIZATION> Telam </ORGANIZATION> quoted Argentine navy sources as saying: `` The fuel it carried, both for itself and the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> stations, was in steel drums so a spill is practically impossible.'' The 316 people aboard the ship when it ran aground, including 82 passengers and 234 crew members, were rescued by power boats and taken to <LOCATION> Palmer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>. The passengers and most of the crew were taken by cruise ship to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shetland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, from which they were airlifted to the South American mainland Sunday. But 104 crewmen remain at the station, said <PERSON> Renerie </PERSON>. Because the station is equipped for only 40 people, food has been rationed to two meals a day, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> statement said.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> is planning a fast-paced swing to possibly more than a dozen <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> capitals this month in an attempt to strengthen contacts in the beleaguered alliance. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> described the tour on Tuesday as as `` a very complicated arrangement'' that could take the new secretary to 14 cities in five days. It would be <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s debut tour abroad as President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief adviser on foreign affairs. The visit comes as tensions are rising within the alliance on developing a response to Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s disarmament overtures and the military cutbacks announced by his <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> allies Another major issue is the dispute over the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contribution to the alliance and pressure for Europeans members to pick up more of their own defense costs. Recent surveys have shown <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s so-called `` charm offensive'' to be highly effective in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, with fewer citizens there viewing the 40-year-old alliance as necessary in light of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leader's public relations offensive. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> intends to meet with `` as many of his <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> colleagues as possible'' and wants to do so in each of the foreign minister's home capitals because the new secretary attaches a very high priority to the sessions. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is scheduled to accompany President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> for a day-long meeting on Feb. 10, as well as to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for the Feb. 24 funeral of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> and the one-day visits that weekend to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> intends to sandwich the European tour between the <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> swing, the spokesman said. The alliance is composed of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 She had come thousands of miles and her journey was nearly over. One last barrier separated the young <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> woman from her husband in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But the <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> was too swift and too cold _ too great an obstacle for a small woman in a flimsy rubber raft _ and she died in its icy waters on Jan. 5. As many as four others may have died with her. The tragedy below <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> has provided shocking testimony to what federal immigration officials have long known: that the swift 40-mile-long river between <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has become a northern crossing point for growing numbers of illegal aliens. Little is known about the young drowning victim, whose body was found in the river near the town of <LOCATION> Lewiston </LOCATION>. Investigators have determined that she was in her 30s, carried two suitcases and a passport that did not belong to her, and had come from a small town in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. Like many others, authorities said, she apparently entrusted her fate to a smuggling ring that brought her to <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, and then was to bring her to her husband in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON>, regional director of the federal <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said his agents have identified half a dozen organized rings involved in smuggling people across the border. One ring is thought to have brought in more than 250 Chinese last year. Police in <LOCATION> Lewiston </LOCATION> caught five <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> immigrants last summer who apparently had crossed the border in a rubber raft. `` When you have a group of wet Chinese walking around the streets of <LOCATION> Lewiston </LOCATION>, you're going to attract some attention,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Peruzzini </PERSON>, head of an INS anti-smuggling unit. <PERSON> Peruzzini </PERSON> said the aliens were natives of <LOCATION> Fukien </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> who had made their way from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> and then <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> with the aid of a New York-based smuggling ring. Their destination was <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION>, where they would have tried to find work as laborers, he said. <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON> said the leaders of the smuggling rings, called arrangers, are usually based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and sometimes smuggle drugs or other contraband. The arrangers have an elaborate system of contacts in cities in several countries. `` You just do n't tell a person in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to buy a plane ticket and leave it at that,'' <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON> said. The arranger will provide false passports, escorts, safe houses in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, the means of getting across the border. The methods vary: Aliens sometimes are squeezed into the trunks of cars or false compartments in tractor-trailers, inched across the towering superstructures of bridges or put in flimsy boats. Fees of more than $ 2,000 per alien make it a lucrative business, <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON> described aliens transported illegally across the border as victims of the smugglers. `` They do n't realize the risks involved. They are simply being preyed upon because of their desire to improve their economic situation,'' he said. Unlike many illegal <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> immigrants who cross the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> with the intention of returning home, those crossing the turbulent <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> channel want to stay in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> permanently, officials said. `` But for the fact they ca n't qualify for an immigration visa, these people pretty much fit the mold of legal immigrants in years past,'' <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON> said. `` For the most part they are honest, hard-working people whose only desire is to better themselves,'' he said. `` If given the opportunity, they'd probably make great Americans.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Niagara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is continuing a search of the river for the bodies of any other passengers in the raft that held the young Malaysian woman. Authorities do n't hold out much hope for finding any bodies until spring, when the ice covering the shoreline melts. Nor do officials expect to hear from the young woman's husband, who risks deportation if he steps forward to retrieve his wife's body Authorities are trying to locate her family in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> so the body can be returned home.

<HEAD>Shuttle Managers Debating Whether To Replace Discovery's Turbopumps</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Meeting starts after 3 p.m. EST</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> says it probably will have to replace at least two suspect turbopumps whose failure could touch off a fatal explosion aboard Discovery, and the repairs could delay the shuttle's liftoff indefinitely. Shuttle managers scheduled a late afternoon meeting today to discuss the three turbopumps, which became questionable when <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> discovered tiny cracks in one of Atlantis' pumps following that shuttle's December flight. The space agency had been aiming for a Feb. 23 liftoff, but a series of technical delays not related to the pumps has erased that date. The agency said it does n't have a new date. The technical problems have postponed Discovery's rollout to the launch pad, originally set for Jan. 26, a total of eight days, with the move now set for Friday. Officials said engineers are likely to replace at least two of Discovery's three turbopumps, delaying the launch for weeks or months. If new pumps have to be installed, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> must decide whether it can roll Discovery to the pad and do the work there along with other operations. Post-flight inspection of Atlantis' engines disclosed two tiny cracks in a bearing assembly in one of three high-pressure liquid oxygen turbopumps. Engineers believe they were caused by stress corrosion resulting from moisture trapped inside the bearing during the manufacturing process, but they are uncertain how the moisture penetrated the metal. Officials became concerned when they found that two of Discovery's turbopumps underwent the same manufacturing process as the cracked one. The turbopump, which transforms the shuttle's liquid oxygen propellant into gas, operates at extremely high temperatures and speeds, and its failure could set off an explosion that could destroy the spaceship. The cracks on Atlantis were too small to cause trouble, but if such cracks widened and split the bearing assembly, it could be dangerous, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials said. In the past, turbopumps have been replaced while a shuttle is horizontal in a processing hangar. But Discovery is vertical, attached to its solid fuel booster rockets and external fuel tank. Technicians have been rehearsing procedures for the more difficult vertical replacement. Officials believe replacing two turbopumps would take at least two weeks, and that replacement of all three could delay the launch indefinitely. If the launch is delayed too long it would affect the next Atlantis mission, which is to dispatch the <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> probe to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> after a liftoff scheduled April 28. Discovery would have to be off the only shuttle launch pad by about March 14 if the April date is to be maintained. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has given Atlantis and <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> priority over the communications satellite in Discovery's cargo bay, so if the Discovery launch slips too much, it will be put off until later in the year. That's because there is only a 25-day period starting April 28 when <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> will be in position to receive a probe from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. After that period expires, it will be two more years before the planet will be aligned properly with <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>.

 Families gathered in a chapel at K.I. <ORGANIZATION> Sawyer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> after learning of the crash of a KC-135A tanker plane in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the third air accident in four months involving <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> personnel. Of the 19 people who died in Tuesday's crash at <ORGANIZATION> Dyess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION>, seven were crew members from <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, 10 were passengers from <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> and two were passengers from <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION>, authorities said. Names were withheld pending notification of families. The news hit hard at <LOCATION> Sawyer </LOCATION>, a small northern <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> base where nearly 1,900 families live. `` We're a very small, tight-knit community,'' said a base spokeswoman, <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>. `` Part of the anxiety is knowing that these are the people you trained with, went to school with, and work with.'' `` It's pretty quiet here. The mood is not good,'' <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said from the <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> NCO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, where she works. `` They've got the news on in the back, and everyone is sitting back there, just watching and listening and not talking.'' `` I think everyone's going to know somebody who was on that plane,'' said <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, whose husband is stationed at <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>. `` My husband wanted to go on that mission. Now I'm glad he was n't picked. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> personnel have been involved in two other crashes, including the explosive crash of another KC-135 trying to land at <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wurtsmith </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Oscoda </LOCATION> on Oct. 11. Six Wurtsmith crew members died in that crash. Ten <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> personnel aboard were able to leap clear of the burning plane. The tanker had been ferrying <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> personnel to Wurtsmith so they could inspect the base's nuclear facilities. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> has completed its investigation of that crash, but the report is not ready for public release, said Major <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, a SAC spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> Barksdale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION>, La.

 <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowfer </PERSON> was in tears when she called <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Hennin </PERSON> with the news that she'd miscalcuated the size of her foundation and realized it would cost nearly $ 1,000 more to build her <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> home. Not to worry, said <PERSON> Hennin </PERSON>, co-owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Shelter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Cowfer </PERSON>'s former instructor. He consoled her, patiently explained how to correct her blunder and even drew diagrams and mailed them to her. Within a few months she was done: three bedrooms, two baths, passive solar heat and a Jacuzzi, and all for $ 55,000 _ about one-third market value. `` They not only give you the information, they give you the confidence,'' <PERSON> Cowfer </PERSON> said. `` You do n't need building experience.'' For 15 years, <PERSON> Hennin </PERSON>, his wife <PERSON> Patsy </PERSON> and several other instructors have taught students how to tackle the forbidding task of building a home _ at less than half the cost of buying the finished home or hiring someone to build it. People who build their own homes are more satisfied, <PERSON> Hennin </PERSON> said. Less hurried than a contractor, the do-it-yourselfer will examine every aspect of the building process and make carefully considered decisions. `` Contractors do n't shop around'' and generally do not match solutions to specific problems, he said. The contractor `` simply does it this way because that's the way they've always done it.'' More than 14,000 students from around the world, including novices who barely knew which end of the hammer to hold, have attended the school located in a 120-year-old brick building in this coastal town north of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. The students range in age from 18 to 70 and have included lumberjacks, doctors, Madison Avenue executives, carpenters, engineers and architects. Students can choose the 15-week, one-day-a-week session for $ 450 per person or $ 725 per couple, or opt for compressed sessions of two or three weeks for slightly more money. Classes are limited to 40 students. All students learn how to survey a lot, pour a foundation, design and build every inch of a house. They also receive instruction in the concept of heat, the physics of materials, engineering, framing and financing. The information `` was presented in such a way that it was non-intimidating,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Miers </PERSON>, 34, who is spending $ 50,000 to build a house valued at $ 140,000 in <LOCATION> Raymond </LOCATION>. `` It was presented in a relaxed fashion.'' Mistakes are n't ruinous, <PERSON> Hennin </PERSON> said, because `` there is n't anything in a house that is n't forgiving. That's comforting for students who also quickly learn that the mistakes they make are much less costly than if a contractor were building the house. `` When a contractor walks into a store, he does n't ask what the price is. He just assumes he's getting the wholesale cost,'' but the price may be lower elsewhere, <PERSON> Hennin </PERSON> said. `` Contractors do n't shop around.'' For example, a shelter institute student can make insulated glass windows for about $ 3 per square foot, whereas a contractor is likely to pay $ 10, <PERSON> Hennin </PERSON> said. All the lumber to build a house rarely would be over $ 4,000, he added. The Hennins, both 45, began their business in 1974. <PERSON> Hennin </PERSON>, who had just finished law school and had some prior building experience, was hired to help build a house for a friend. Soon he had other offers to build, and his wife's interest in home construction surfaced. `` We had a choice of building houses for the rest of our lives or getting involved in another way _ teaching people,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hennin </PERSON> said. Housing styles have changed over the last 15 years. After the simple, box-style homes that marked the days of energy conservation and the back-to-the-earth movement of the early and mid-1970s, underground homes became popular. Those now have been replaced by elaborate designs more reflective of the 1980s: prosperity, sophistication and self-indulgence, Mrs. <PERSON> Hennin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roxie </PERSON> <PERSON> Westbrook </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, are building a passive-solar country house on the outskirts of the nearby <ORGANIZATION> Henry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cowell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Redwoods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, complete with a hot tub and more gadgets and fixtures than they had in the older homes they owned. `` There's nothing cheap in it,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Westbrook </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` When it's a choice between quality and going for quality, we go for quality.'' Others prefer a home that is unadorned. <PERSON> Miers </PERSON> and his wife left <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> with the romantic notion of building a home that embraced their 1960s values _ the desire to be independent, energy-efficient and frugal. But despite changing tastes, Mrs. <PERSON> Hennin </PERSON> says most people are joined by a creative urge and a determination to take control of their lives. `` It's a grabbing of life, rather than letting life roll you over,'' she said. `` If houses cost so much, it's your responsibility to figure out a way for them not to cost so much.''

<TEXT>
 Some 30 years ago an explosive drama by a unknown young black woman defied the odds, the experts and the money men to open on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansberry </PERSON>'s `` A Raisin in the Sun,'' which starred <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Poitier </PERSON>, went on to win critical raves, and stablished itself as a cornerstone in Amnerican theater. While the story of a black <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> family's move from the ghetto into a white neighborhood has been produced thousands of times and has captivated millions of theater patrons and moviegoers worldwide, <PERSON> Hansberry </PERSON>'s original play has never been seen in its entirety. However, a new, uncut production will be broadcast by <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 1. It stars <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Glover </PERSON> and <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Rolle </PERSON>. It is the year's first production in the `` American Playhouse,'' now in its eighth season. The new production will include nearly an hour's worth of restored material, including themes of feminism, African nationalism and black pride. `` Nothing that was cut was cut to censor the play,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemiroff </PERSON>, the late playwright's husband and literary executor. `` Pressures were enormous to keep the play as tight and streamlined as it could possibly be.'' When the play opened on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION> in 1959, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON>, writing for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, called it `` an impressive first play, beautifully acted ... relieving and wonderfully caustic comedy.'' Directed by <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, it ran for two years and received the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Drama Critics Award for best play. It is the story of a family whose prospects for the future brighten considerably when misfortune strikes. The death of <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Younger </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON> leaves his wife with a $ 10,000 life-insurance policy and the problem of how to use it. Her son, a chauffeur, wants the money to start a new business, and her daughter needs money for medical school. Another option, the wife sees, is buying a new home for the family. In one restored scene a neighbor comes in with a newspaper story about the bombing of a black family's house after they had moved into a white neighborhood. `` This obviously shows the danger the Youngers are facing at the curtain,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, director of the PBS production. `` It makes clear that for all the joy and affirmation of the family's inner triumph at the end, it is anything but a traditional happy ending. The scene was cut from the Broadway production to save the added cost of another actor's salary. It took producer <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> nearly two years to find a co-producer and the money to stage the production. Even with the money in hand, Broadway theaters were not willing to rent to the new production until it had proved itself out of town, <PERSON> Nemiroff </PERSON> said. But once on stage, the shortened play _ which with an uncany prescience foresaw the rise of black pride and nationalism in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> _ became a hit with both blacks and whites. `` Never before in the entire history of the American theater had so much of the truth of black people's lives been seen on the stage,'' the late author <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> wrote. While not autobiographical, `` Raisin'' had its origins in <PERSON> Hansberry </PERSON>'s own childhood experiences in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in the 1930s when her family moved into a white neighborhood. They were evicted from their home by an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> court, but her father, a prosperous real-estate broker and banker, fought the case to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which outlawed the restrictive covenant. After trying her hand at painting and determining she had no talent, <PERSON> Hansberry </PERSON> moved to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1950 where she concentrated on her writing, but made little effort at publishing, and earned a living with a number of odd jobs. Although she wrote extensively, she completed only two plays during her brief life, `` A Raisin in the Sun'' and `` The Sign in <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Brustein </PERSON>'s Window.'' She died of cancer in 1965 at the age of 34. <PERSON> Nemiroff </PERSON>, who married <PERSON> Hansberry </PERSON> in 1953, has devoted much of his life since her death to editing and shaping her works into publishable form, including the well-received `` To Be Young, Gifted and Black'' and `` Les Blancs.'' <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> DeWindt </PERSON>, a teacher, director and associate producer of the PBS production of `` Raisin,'' said that aside from the restoration of the original material, this newest version differs from many previous productions in one important respect. `` Every moment is motivated by love, as opposed to it being a competition between people,'' he said. `` In other productions it was more a fight to see who was more powerful. The message is much clearer and much more universal. If it had n't been done that way, it would have been just another play about who is more powerful than who.'' Rose and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Susskind </PERSON> produced the movie version in 1961. Directed by <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrie </PERSON>, it starred <PERSON> Poitier </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> <PERSON> Dee </PERSON>, <PERSON> Claudia </PERSON> <PERSON> McNeil </PERSON>, <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Sands </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Gossett </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 One holy man walked naked among his disciples, offering sacred ash, blessings and cardamoms as consecrated host. Not far away, another holy man delivered a sermon while dressed in a saffron robe. `` Why move naked?'' the second said. `` You can reach God dressed.'' A third, who pitched his tent nearby, told his group: `` Dress does not matter. Ways do not matter. ... Be pure, be good and you will reach heaven. You need no guru.'' They were Hindu holy men at the <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION>'s biggest congregation, the `` <PERSON> Kumbh </PERSON> <PERSON> Mela </PERSON>,'' which began here recently in <LOCATION> Allahabad </LOCATION>. The three holy men, each with different views, were examples of the diversity of a religion believed to have been practiced since the third millennium B.C. They also showed that <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION>, with 330 million gods and goddesses, can be confusing even to Hindus. The religion claims a following of 730 million people in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. For comparison, the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> claims a following of 850 million. An estimated 500,000 holy men and their followers started camping at <LOCATION> Allahabad </LOCATION> on Jan. 14, for a seven-week congregation, or fair, during which 30 million to 40 million pilgrims were expected to take dips at the `` Sangam,'' the confluence of the three rivers most sacred to Hindus _ the <LOCATION> Ganges </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Jamuna </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Saraswathi </LOCATION>. The `` Sangam,'' which takes it's name from a mythical fight between gods and demons over a pot of nectar, is held every 12 years when <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION> enters Taurus and the Sun and the Moon are in <LOCATION> Capricorn </LOCATION>. `` You ca n't explain <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION>,'' said M.P. <PERSON> Asthana </PERSON>, who has attended four earlier fairs. `` It is a way of life, where karmas -LRB- the results of deeds -RRB- are most important. Even to an average Hindu, the faith is so confusing.'' He added: `` No one can explain how we got to acquire and where are our 330 million gods and goddesses.'' Believers worship images and statues of gods and goddesses as well as live animals, including rats. In <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION> every god has his steed, or vehicle, and the rat is the vehicle of Ganesha on whom the elephant-headed, master-of-ceremony god rides. <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION> postulates that everyone goes through a series of rebirths, or reincarnations, that eventually lead to <LOCATION> Moksha </LOCATION>, the spiritual salvation that frees one from the cycle of rebirths. `` With each rebirth you can move closer to or further from eventual moksha,'' said <PERSON> Asthana </PERSON>, who is the spokesman for the state government of <LOCATION> Uttar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION>, in which Allahabad is a major city. `` The deciding factor is one's karma. Bad actions result in bad karma, which leads one to lower incarnation and a step further from salvation. `` But if one's actions have been good he or she will reincarnate on a higher level and be a step closer to eventual freedom from rebirth.'' Coming to <LOCATION> Allahabad </LOCATION> has special significance for Hindus and tens of thousands come daily to take holy dips at the <LOCATION> Sangam </LOCATION>, believing doing this during the auspicious planetary conjugation will wash away all the sins of a lifetime and release them from the cycle of births and rebirths. `` It is like appearing directly before God for confessions,'' said <PERSON> Jagannath </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwevedi </PERSON>, the chief adminstrator of the fair. `` No one knows how bathing will wash off sins, but the belief is so great that no logic stands.'' Before taking the dip, pilgrims offer milk and marigolds to the rivers in a purification ritual and later throw water with their hands toward the sky, believing that some drops will reach their ancestors in the heaven. `` Now, this sounds like a total nonsense, but people do it,'' said the 56-year-old <PERSON> Dwevedi </PERSON>. `` It is the age-old belief. It is above logic.'' Nagas are the naked recluses of <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION> and they have their own logic. `` Nakedness ends all dichotomy in human life,'' said one, refusing to give his name. `` We were born naked and therefore should remain naked and die naked.'' Fifty-two different religious groups put up sprawling tent homes at the fair. Each has its own way to reach God. Most of them constantly smoke marijuana. They say it helps them meditate and become closer to God. `` This makes <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION> unique,'' said <PERSON> Asthana </PERSON>. `` There is no restriction on how you reach your goal _ salvation.'' Only vegetables appear on the fair's menus because devout Hindus are vegetarians and eating beef is taboo. Hindus worship the cow.

 For three days, a 73-year-old man sat stuck in a garbage can up to his armpits on his front porch, dressed only in a nightshirt while temperatures dipped into the 20s. Now that he has been found dead, the community is left with a troubling question: Why did n't somebody help <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamm </PERSON>? `` It was pretty strange,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> R.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Liepins </PERSON>, who discovered <PERSON> Hamm </PERSON> on Jan. 25. `` We depend on people telling us if they see something unusual in the neighborhood so we can check it out. That did n't happen here.'' A postman and a 11-year-old newsgirl saw him sitting in the can on the enclosed porch, several feet from the door, but neither realized he was in trouble. `` He waved to me and I acknowledged just like I'd done hundreds of times before,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vane </PERSON>, the postman. `` It was a nice day and I just assumed he was sitting there reading the paper and smoking a cigar, just like always,'' Vane said Monday. As he walked away, however, he thought something did n't look right, but he said he did n't go back to take a second look. `` In retrospect, I feel bad about what happened, but I really did n't think anything was wrong,'' he said. The newsgirl told her mother, <PERSON> Liepins </PERSON> said, but the woman thought her daughter was exaggerating or seeing some kind of reflection. The girl told her the same thing the next day and finally, after the girl and her 13-year-old brother insisted, the woman went to <PERSON> Hamm </PERSON>'s home two blocks away, looked at the man through the locked door on the enclosed porch and called police. `` I'm just kicking myself for not taking this more seriously,'' she told the <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Union </ORGANIZATION>. Since talking about the incident, the family has received death threats and prank phone calls, <PERSON> Liepins </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hamm </PERSON> lived on a corner lot in a middle-class, residential neighborhood in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>. At a funeral service Monday at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monica </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, Father <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaudio </PERSON> told friends and relatives that they had to continue to have faith despite <PERSON> Hamm </PERSON>'s `` senseless death ... in a ridiculous situation.'' His son <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said the family did not want to talk with the media, but he characterized reports in the local media about his father as `` highly inaccurate and absolutely ghoulish.'' Some neighbors described <PERSON> Hamm </PERSON> as an eccentric and a drinker. Others said he was lonely and appeared to be depressed. <PERSON> Liepins </PERSON> said investigators found open whiskey bottles in the two-story, wood-frame house. Authorities have speculated that <PERSON> Hamm </PERSON> suffered a heart attack and slumped into the can after resting on its edge. Or, they say, he may have fallen into the can and then suffered the heart attack. Dr. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> medical examiner, said <PERSON> Hamm </PERSON> died of a heart attack, but it's not possible to determine when it happened. <PERSON> Liepins </PERSON> said the door to the porch was locked and he had to break a basement window to get into the house. He found some money and other valuables, so police do not suspect any foul play. `` The thing that really gets you,'' <PERSON> Liepins </PERSON> said, `` is imagining yourself in that position and not being able to get help.''

<HEAD>British Government Offers To Buy AK-47s, Which Become Illegal Today</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government is offering to buy Kalashnikov assault rifles and other high-powered guns that become illegal today under a new firearms law. Owners have until April 30 to apply for the $ 265 payment, Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said Tuesday. The sum is based on the price such rifles fetched at auction before parliament took up the measure in September 1987. Under the new law, the penalty for possessing a prohibited weapon is up to five years in jail or a $ 3,500 fine. The Firearms -LRB- Amendment -RRB- Act was introduced after <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> killed 16 people as he strolled through the small town of <LOCATION> Hungerford </LOCATION> in August 1987 before taking his own life. It bans the private use of high-powered self-loading rifles like the Kalashnikov, which <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> used in the massacre, and other weapons including short-barreled, smooth-bore guns. Fully automatic weapons are already prohibited in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The government payment applies to owners who acquired the newly banned weapons before September 23, 1987. Calls in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for greater restrictions on the sale of semi-automatic weapons have increased since last month's shootings in a <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, elementary school yard <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> killed five children and wounded 30 people with a Kalashnikov AK-47 assault rifle before ending his own life, police say.

<HEAD>Two Men Jailed for Trapping A Fox In Its Lair</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRKENHEAD, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the first successful prosecution of its kind in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, two men were sentenced to a month in jail for causing a fox to suffocate after trapping it in its lair. Some spectators applauded after <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pruden </PERSON>, 27, and <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, 27, were sentenced Tuesday by magistrates in this north central city near <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pruden </PERSON> and <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION>, were also banned for two years from keeping any animal. The Royal Society for the <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animals </ORGANIZATION>, which filed the complaint against the two men, argued that the fox was made captive when the men blocked two holes to its lair. The two were found guilty on Jan. 3 of causing unnecessary suffering to a captive fox. It was the first time anyone was found convicted of such a crime, despite years of anti-fox hunting efforts by animal rights activists. Animal rights groups have battled for years to disrupt `` blood'' sports such as fox hunting. They have laid false trails for hounds, bought grounds used for deer hunts. Once, two men desecrated the grave of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s greatest fox hunter, the Duke of <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> is urging the Peruvian government to investigate the murder of a journalist and do more to safeguard other threatened members of the press. The respected London-based organization, in a message to President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> on Tuesday, called violence against journalists a `` gross violation'' of their right to work. The institute's director, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Galliner </PERSON>, wrote that the institute is `` extremely concerned'' at the lack of any investigation into the murder of <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bustios </PERSON>, 34, a local correspondent for the <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> news magazine <ORGANIZATION> Caretas </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bustios </PERSON> and another journalist, 27-year-old <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rojas </PERSON>, were shot by gunmen in November while traveling by motorcycle on the outskirts of the Peruvian city of <LOCATION> Huanta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rojas </PERSON> was seriously wounded. `` Furthermore, we deplore the recent increase in violence against journalists in general,'' the message says. `` Whilst we are aware of the current complex situation in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, we would remind you that such attacks are a gross violation of the right of journalists to gather information and the right of people everywhere to receive information,'' it says. `` We strongly urge an immediate and rigorous enquiry into the murder of the <PERSON> Caretas </PERSON>' correspondent and that your government acts at once to ensure that journalists may pursue their work without interference or fear of their physical safety,'' it says. Peruvian officials said they had not determined whether <PERSON> Bustios </PERSON>' murder was carried out by the Shining Path insurgency, a Mao-inspired group which has been fighting to overthrow the government for eight years, or a new anti-rebel death squad called the <ORGANIZATION> Rodigo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Franco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> Both groups have threatened journalists in and around <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>, the birthplace of the Shining Path, 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Huanta </LOCATION>.

 The family of a boy who died two years after a bus accident left him comatose committed suicide in grief and left its assets to `` traffic accident victims who live like vegetables,'' police said today. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hi-yun </PERSON>, 50, director of a <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> field office, his wife and 22-year-old son were found dead by <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s chauffeur and sister-in-law Monday in the family's apartment, police said `` We have decided to follow our son, Kyu-tak, because our lives have been miserable since he died,'' police quoted a suicide note left by the family as saying. `` We expect social charity organizations to use all our assets for those traffic accident victims who live like vegetables.'' Kyu-tak was a high school freshman three years ago when he was hit by a city bus near school. He never regained consciousness and died Nov. 17. No value could immediately be placed on the family's assets, which include a two-story building and a plot of land in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, police said.

<HEAD>Smiling, Waving Soviet Soldiers Depart Kabul, `Glad To Be Leaving'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHARON HERBAUGH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet soldiers smiled and waved as their convoy left <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> for home today on the strategic <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>, an Afghan government spokesman said. Heavy shelling could be heard just up the road. At dawn, the convoy moved through a checkpoint about two miles from the capital, en route to the Soviet border 250 miles miles away, said an <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman who identified himself only as <PERSON> Hamad </PERSON>. The spokesman said the convoy, mostly made up of trucks carrying up to 50 soldiers each, took 50 minutes to pass through the checkpoint. `` They were happy to be leaving. They were smiling and waving,'' he said. <PERSON> Hamad </PERSON> said artillery fire heard about six miles up the road came from guerrillas hiding in the mountains that surround the highway, the only land route home for <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Afghan soldiers refused to allow any non-military vehicles up the road, citing the possibility of heavy shelling. But crowded buses traveled south down the highway, with people riding on top dressed in ragged shawls and turbans that flapped in the winter wind. <PERSON> Hamad </PERSON> declined to say when the next convoy would move out, but said convoys have been leaving every other day in recent weeks. On Tuesday, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromov </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> forces in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, wooould not say how many Soviet troops remained in the country or when the withdrawal would be completed. <PERSON> Gromov </PERSON> also denied <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allegations that the Soviets were conducting a `` scorched earth'' policy as their last units leave <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in advance of a Feb. 15 deadline. In neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s capital of <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, Western diplomats said all Soviet forces were expected to be out of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> by Feb. 6, nine days before the deadline set by a U.N.-mediated withdrawal agreement. Spokesmen in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> for the guerrillas, who began fighting after a communist coup 11 years ago, said four long-range Soviet missiles killed 70 people this week in villages near the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>. According to the Western diplomats, the increase in attacks by Soviet and government forces appeared aimed at pressuring the insurgents toward a political settlement. The guerrillas have refused offers of such a settlement from both the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> and its client government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The last 11 staff members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, which was closed Monday, left <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on Tuesday and a Soviet airlift of food and fuel resumed. Six Ilyushin 76 transport planes dropped flares to deflect missiles as they landed at midday Tuesday. Each was followed by a camouflaged military helicopter dropping flares. Guerrillas supported by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> control the hills and mountains around <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and often fire heat-seaking missiles at aircraft near the airport. They also have attacked supply convoys bound for <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION>, causing severe food and fuel shortages that made the Soviet airlift necessary. Soviet and Western diplomats estimate the number of Soviet soldiers still in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> at 15,000-20 ,000 <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers arrived in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 and an estimated 115,000 were in the country when the pullout began May 15. Some military advisers will remain in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in keeping with a Soviet-Afghan agreement, <PERSON> Gromov </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> contends such a presence would violate the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreements of April 14, under which the withdrawal is being conducted. `` I want to underline the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will fulfill its commitments under the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreements,'' <PERSON> Gromov </PERSON> said, adding, `` We do n't intend to bomb the territory of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> territory after the withdrawal of Soviet soldiers.'' Heavy fighting has occurred between <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> and Afghan troops and the guerrillas of <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Masoud </PERSON> along the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Masoud </PERSON>, one of the best insurgent field commanders, controls the <LOCATION> Panjshir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> through which the highway runs. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, Col.-Gen. <PERSON> Bronislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Omelichev </PERSON>, first deputy Soviet chief of staff, said Tuesday: `` Our troops deliver strikes or engage in combat operations just to secure the safety of the withdrawal of our troops to the territory of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gromov </PERSON> said the Afghan government had negotiated with <PERSON> Masoud </PERSON> to make the Salang Highway safe, but he rejected the offer and began attacking Afghan army outposts Jan. 23. `` I think he is sorry now,'' the general said.

<TEXT>
 A 10-year-old boy has gone on trial in open court for selling crack cocaine, despite his lawyer's pleas that the case be closed to the public, as is the case in most Family Court proceedings. <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Family Court Judge <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Auperin </PERSON> cited society's concern over drug abuse in ruling Tuesday that the case should be tried before the public `` This is a tragic story of a young boy who may have been at the wrong place at the wrong time,'' the boy's Legal Aid lawyer, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>. `` It was n't his fault that he lives in a place where these types of things take place. He did not choose the place where he lives.'' The boy, whose name the judge asked the press to withhold, lives with his family in a poor neighborhood in <LOCATION> Wyandanch </LOCATION>, a suburban <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> community about 20 miles east of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The 5-foot-tall defendant appeared bored and at times sleepy as four <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police officers took the stand to describe the events that led to his arrest Jan. 15. Two officers testified that they saw the boy and his 14-year-old companion selling crack from a BMX dirt bike that they rode up and down Straight Path in <LOCATION> Wyandanch </LOCATION>, an area known for drug-dealing. When police moved into arrest them, an officer testified, the 10-year-old threw away a brown paper bag that was found to contain three plastic bags of crack, worth $ 20 each. The two boys were found to be carrying $ 226. The older boy is being tried seperately. During an intermission in the two-hour proceeding, he began to cry. A court officer asked his mother to comfort him, and she walked over and patted him on the shoulder, which seemed to calm him. When Tuesday's session was over, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> asked if the child could go home for the night, but the judge refused and ordered him taken to the <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION>'s Shelter, where he has been held for the past two weeks. As the child was handcuffed and led out, he called out in a choked-up voice, `` Mommy, are you coming back tomorrow?'' His mother called back, `` Yes, yes.''

<TEXT>
 A federal judge ordered the release of a man accused of trying to export nerve gas, despite the government's contention that the suspect was a threat to national security because he held highly sensitive classified documents <PERSON> Juhwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> was scheduled to be released on $ 2 million bail this afternoon after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> ruled that the government had failed to demonstrate that <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> was a risk to flee. Federal prosecutors are appealing the ruling. At a hearing Tuesday, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> had argued that the Korean-American businessman's ties with foreign governments and military bases abroad would make him likely to flee to avoid prosecution. Singer also disclosed that <PERSON> Yun </PERSON>, 48, of <LOCATION> Short </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, held documents revealing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' capability to intercept enemy communications. She said the documents were found on a desk at <PERSON> Yun </PERSON>'s import-export business `` <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> appears to have had contact with individuals in or associated with branches of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military and-or military installations abroad,'' Ms. <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> said in a letter to the court. `` Revelation of the information would not only compromise specifics of our EW -LRB- Electronic Warfare -RRB- capabilities but would also reveal details of our knowledge of enemy threat,'' <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oetinger </PERSON>, vice director of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said in a memorandum to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> was arrested Jan. 12 by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs Agents when he arrived for a meeting with an undercover agent he believed was an arms dealer. Military documents found afterward in <PERSON> Yun </PERSON>'s office were used by the government previously to argue that <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> should not be released on bail. Ms. Singer has argued that <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> apparently had contacts with several foreign governments, which would prefer he not stand trial in the case. The government previously has said <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> may have had contacts at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military installations. The documents filed Tuesday reveal for the first time that those contacts may have been at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases in other countries. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Arnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, declined comment until he had time to review the new government disclosures. The new information also alleges that Korean-language documents marked `` Secret'' show how much is known about an unidentified enemy's electronic signals and gives details of specialized warfare systems expected for use in the year 1992 and beyond. Although the documents were in Korean, the government's new filings do not say if they were from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government or if the enemy mentioned was <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The documents also discussed electronic countermeasures, the jamming of enemy signals and the deposition, numbers and locations of enemy forces, according to the court papers. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> is charged along with a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> national for allegedly plotting to buy the nerve gas sarin and other military equipment for export. Authorities have said the nerve gas's possible destination was <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cimusz </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> counterintelligence agent, said in a new affidavit filed Tuesday that <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> had been investigated previously for allegedly trying to obtain other military equipment, including night-vision equipment, fighter planes and tank parts. The government has said <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> boasted of high-level military and civilian contacts with <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cimusz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> has had contact with officials of two different countries that `` are of counterintellgence interest to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'' and that he had `` official documents from a third country of counterintelligence interest to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>.''

 Sikh extremists with Chinese assault rifles barged into a farmer's house in the northern state of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> and fatally shot him and five of his relatives, a senior police official said today. The floor in the farmer's house in <LOCATION> Ladho </LOCATION> village, 21 miles from this holy city of Sikhs, was covered with blood after the killings Tuesday, senior police superintendent <PERSON> Sanjeev </PERSON> <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON> said. The victims, identified as <PERSON> Bakhish </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, his wife <PERSON> Kulwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaur </PERSON> and their two sons and two daughters-in-law were converts to the Sikh faith, <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, about 250 miles north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. `` The bodies were piled in a corner of the bullet-riddled room and utensils smeared in blood lay scattered,'' he said. A blood-soaked kirpan, the traditional sword carried by all Sikh men, lay next to <PERSON> Bakhish </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON> said. Police believe seven or eight gunmen fired on the family and escaped under cover of darkness. Sikh extremists, waging a violent war to establish a theocratic state, are known to have killed fellow Sikhs who are not sympathetic to their cause. A total of 181 people have been killed this year in the extremist-linked violence in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state, where a majority of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 18 million Sikhs live. Sikh extremists want to carve out an independent homeland in the agriculturally rich <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state and call it ` <LOCATION> Khalistan </LOCATION>' -LRB- Land of the Pure -RRB-.

<HEAD>Statistician Estimates AIDS Spread From A Solitary Prostitute</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An AIDS-infected prostitute who has unprotected sex with her customers will spread the killer virus to 60 adults and one unborn baby over a five-year period, a study suggests. The study, published in February's issue of the Journal of Sex Research, was based solely on statistical calculations and did n't analyze actual cases of prostitutes with AIDS It said 20 men, 40 of their female partners and one unborn baby would be infected with the incurable disease. `` The fact that one very active prostitute could be responsible for about one infected baby seems pretty high when you consider the number of prostitutes infected with the virus,'' <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> statistician <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Nahmias </PERSON> said Tuesday. But the study supports the notion that `` prostitutes are a major source of spreading AIDS to the heterosexual community,'' <PERSON> Nahmias </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` There are public policy implications in terms of getting prostitutes off the street who are infected with AIDS, but I'm not advocating quarantining them,'' he said. `` It's not my job to suggest actions.'' Because the study is based on certain assumptions, the figures <PERSON> Nahmias </PERSON> calculated are `` probably high, but how high really ca n't be determined,'' said Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dassey </PERSON>, deputy medical director of the <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. `` The issue is not whether we get rid of prostitutes,'' <PERSON> Dassey </PERSON> said. `` The issue is whether people make healthy choices about who they have sex with.'' <PERSON> Nahmias </PERSON> said his study assumed condoms were n't used, so the estimates would be lower if clients of prostitutes use latex prophylactics. The study, based on mathematical formulas and assumptions <PERSON> Nahmias </PERSON> called reasonable, predicted that one active, AIDS-infected prostitute could be expected within a five-year period to infect 20 men, who would infect 40 other female sex partners, who in turn would produce 0.8 infected children. Recent studies have shown the AIDS infection rate among prostitutes is about 6 percent in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, about 9 percent to 21 percent in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and 49 percent in northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, where most of those infected also abused intravenous drugs, a major way the virus is spread. <PERSON> Nahmias </PERSON>' study assumed that only two of the 40 women infected by prostitutes' clients became pregnant during the five-year period, which may mean the number of AIDS-infected babies is understated. The study also did n't estimate the total number of AIDS cases resulting from a single prostitute. For example, it excluded men infected by women who were infected by prostitutes' clients. On the other hand, <PERSON> Dassey </PERSON> said the estimates may be high because it assumed that each prostitute engaged in 2,000 sexual contacts yearly _ more than five daily _ including with repeat clients, and that each male client engaged in sex 200 times annually. The study assumed a 1-in-500 chance that the AIDS virus would be spread during a single sexual act. <PERSON> Dassey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nahmias </PERSON> agreed that figure is valid based on several studies of male-to-female transmission. But <PERSON> Dassey </PERSON> said the risk is probably lower for female-to-male transmission. He also said the study assumed all sex acts were vaginal intercourse and ignored the likelihood that prostitutes more frequently perform oral sex upon clients, an act less likely to spread the AIDS virus. <PERSON> Nahmias </PERSON>, however, said his figures might be understated because they ignore increased odds that prostitutes and their clients also suffer sores from other venereal diseases, which would likely raise the chance of AIDS infection from a single sex act higher than 1 in 500. The Journal of Sex Research is published by the Society for the <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sex </ORGANIZATION> and is edited by researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Doctors, Nurses, Unions Oppose Health Service Shake-Up Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The government's plan for a major reform of the free <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> _ cutting billions in state costs by letting big hospitals charge fees and by promoting private insurance _ is meeting stiff opposition. Many doctors, nurses and major unions expressed serious reservations about the plan announced Tuesday by the Conservative government. Some condemned it as an attempt to dismantle the system. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> called the legislative proposals the `` most far-reaching reform of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in its 40-year history.'' Health Secretary <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>, the Cabinet member heading the service, added: `` All our proposals share a common purpose _ to make the health service a place where patients come first.'' But the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> accused the government of trying to wreck the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Bickerstaffe </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, one of the main health service unions, condemned it as `` a cynical charter to dismember the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and transplant <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s health care in a commercial circus.'' The 650,000-member union represents hospital cleaners, porters, kitchen staff and other health service workers. The <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that it had `` serious reservations about whether the proposals will produce the desired improvements in the quality of services.'' Under the plan, the 320 largest and most sophisticated of the 2,000 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> hospitals can become independent in 1991, taking fee-paying private patients and billing local authorities for others. The 320 self-governing hospitals under the government plan also will be able to charge patients for extras such as meals, private telephones or television. For the first time too, private health insurance for the elderly, the biggest burden on the state system, will be tax-deductible. The self-governing hospitals under the government plan will be able to attract quality staff, from consultants to cleaners, by setting their own pay scales, the government said. Other planned changes include fining general practitioners who prescribe too many medicines. Under the plan, family doctors with big practices will get separate state budgets to buy drugs and hospital treatment from private, state or self-governing hospitals for elective surgery. They will be allowed to keep half of any savings on the drugs budget. Consultants and general practitioners will have their costs independently audited and, like hospitals, will be encouraged to compete for patients. The plan, to be drafted as a government bill, needs parliamentary approval to become law. But the government's overwhelming parliamentary majority ensures its passage and the entire package of proposed changes is expected to be in force within three years. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> came into operation on July 5, 1948, part of a wave of social legislation by <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Attlee </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government designed to give <PERSON> Britons </PERSON> a better post-war life. The new plan is seen by some as an attempt to borrow from the American health system, with its emphasis on private care, without increasing spending. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> operates alongside a smaller system of private hospitals and other medical care. The private system is not affected by the government plans unveiled Tuesday. Government officials said the plan will streamline the health bureaucracy, give the public wider choice but deny no one access to free treatment. <PERSON> Trevor </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nursing </ORGANIZATION> representing health service nurses, said: `` I do not see much consumer choice in these proposals. ... As patients, we all have a price tag on our heads now. `` Some of this looks like a return to the elite voluntary hospitals and local authority infirmaries when I first started nursing'' before World War II. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has 1 million staff. Used by 90 percent of the population, it is generally popular and Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has held back from exposing it to her strategy of rolling back socialism. Instead, spending has increased by nearly one-third since 1979 to $ 38.7 billion a year.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> will appeal his manslaughter conviction by arguing that the judge in the child-killing case was prejudiced from the start, an attorney said. Attorney <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> London </PERSON> said Tuesday he remembered that state Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> predicted at a pretrial bail hearing that <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> was `` probably guilty, probably would be found guilty and probably would be sentenced to life in prison.'' <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> used prejudicial rulings and inflammatory evidence to coax the jury toward a conviction on a more serious charge so he would not seem wrong. `` After all,'' <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said, `` if there were a second-degree manslaughter conviction here, it certainly would have made his earlier opinion look foolish.'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, 47, was convicted of first-degree manslaughter Monday in the death of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, the 6-year-old girl he illegally adopted at birth. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> prejudiced the case by repeatedly letting the jury view a videotape of a seriously beaten <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, the defendant's former live-in companion, and by his instructions to the jury regarding the definition of intent. `` There is no question in my mind from the length of the deliberations and from talking to the jurors ... that <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> got a fair shake from the jurors,'' <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said at his <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> office. But `` it is a serious issue whether <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> got a fair trial because of the judge's rulings.'' <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said neither he nor his co-counsel at the trial, <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> DiLuzio </PERSON>, had spoken to <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> since the verdict. `` We're going to have to make a provision for him to be kept in protective custody in upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> assuming he gets a serious jail sentence, and I would anticipate that happening,'' <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said. But he said <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> is not afraid. `` <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> is not a fearing person,'' <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said. `` He's been able to handle himself in a safe way at <LOCATION> Rikers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> -LRB- jail -RRB-. <LOCATION> Rikers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> has not been without incident, but he's done OK there.'' Also Tuesday, Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>'s attorneys, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheck </PERSON> and <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON>, said their client was `` relieved and gratified'' that <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> had been convicted and `` will now try to make herself into a useful person.'' <PERSON> Scheck </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> will remain at the Four Winds psychiatric facility in <LOCATION> Katonah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, for a while. Ms. <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>'s civil attorney, noted that she had filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> `` basically for the destruction of her life.'' `` She needs the wherewithal to put her life together again,'' Ms. <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON> said, `` and that includes financial ability.''

<HEAD>More Than 400 Prisoners Pardoned on Revolution Anniversary</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has pardoned 423 prisoners and commuted the prison terms of another 50 under an amnesty issued for the 10th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution, the Iranian government said today. The official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said those pardoned have been released in the past two days. It said amnesty for other prisoners is expected to be issued during the 10-day celebrations that began today, the anniversary of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s return to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> from exile in 1979. The brief report, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, did not give any other details. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported last week that <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> would pardon prisoners on the national holiday that marks the overthrow of the Iranian monarchy by the Islamic Revolution. It said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would also suspend executions of prisoners sentenced to death during the 10 days. At least 132 alleged drug traffickers have been executed this month in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Another five men, all of them Afghan nationals, were executed Tuesday after they were convicted of armed robberies and rape. More than 1,500 people have been arrested in a nationwide anti-narcotics campaign. A law passed in early December mandates the death penalty for anyone found in the possession of even small qunatities of drugs. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, the London-based human rights group, on Monday appealed to the world to put pressure on the <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> regime to halt what it called a campaign of political executions. Amnesty said about 1,000 political prisoners have been executed in the past six months.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar was mostly higher in light, early European trading today, and its strength pushed down gold prices, currency and bullion dealers said. European currency dealers attributed the dollar's rise to comments by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> on Tuesday that current exchange rates were tolerable. They predicted little movement until finance ministers and central bankers of the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> industrialized nations meet in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> later this week. `` At the moment, the dollar is trading in a very narrow range,'' said a dealer at a large German bank in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. `` I see it moving higher very, very slowly.'' Dealers in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, said the market also appeared confident that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would act to reduce the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deficit. `` This is honeymoon time for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and that's certainly helping the dollar,'' said one trader at a major European commercial bank in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar surged 1.27 yen to a closing 130.40. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 130.00 yen. Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday: _ 1.8719 West German marks, up from 1.8710 _ 1.5952 Swiss francs, down from 1.5985 _ 6.3720 French francs, up from 6.3580 _ 2.1154 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1100 _ 1,370.75 Italian lire, up from 1,365.00 _ 1.1840 Canadian dollars, unchanged In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound cost 1.7475 dollars, cheaper for Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 390.20 a troy ounce, down from $ 394.25 bid late Tuesday.

 Slowly, gingerly, benumbed Alaskans emerged from their shuttered homes and shops as a mass of bitterly cold air that broke temperature records blew southward into <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the lower 48 states today. With the icy weather went high winds that raked much of the state earlier in the week, resulting in at least one death. On Tuesday, the body of a man whose skiff was swamped by high seas and strong winds off the coast of southeast <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> was found on a beach. <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, helped by sunny skies, recorded a toasty high of minus 2 degrees, substantially above the double-digit, sub-zero lows that plagued <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s largest city during the two-week cold snap. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Inderbitzen </PERSON>, the owner of <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cab </ORGANIZATION>, said his drivers still were scrambling to keep up with a nonstop demand for rides, but the destinations changed a bit with the warmer weather Tuesday night. `` People are starting to go out a little more,'' <PERSON> Inderbitzen </PERSON> said. `` They're going to the bars and the restaurants a little more. I noticed it tonight.'' Business also was getting back to normal in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s northernmost ice-free harbor, where winds gusting to 93 mph had shut down the trans-Alaska oil pipeline terminal and caused officials to reduce the flow of oil from the North Slope by 65 percent. Tankers, banned earlier from the harbor because the wind made the Valdez Narrows dangerous, were allowed to pick up loads at the terminal Tuesday and flow in the pipeline was expected to increase to normal levels of more than 2 million barrels daily, said <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said temperatures in much of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> would moderate toward the end of the week, but remain well below normal for this time of year. The arctic air lingered over <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> for more than a week, locked in place by a warm-air jet stream that blew more northerly than usual, the weather service said. When the jet stream shifted south, the icy mass broke free, sending balmy temperatures plunging in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. Eagle Village Store owner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> said residents in that tiny <LOCATION> Yukon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> village 360 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> were taking the cold in stride. `` Most of the people are accustomed to this,'' he said. `` Our average temperature for this time of year is 25 or 30 below. It's not that bad We have n't had any cold weather like this in six years. But it used to be pretty normal.'' Major hospitals in the state reported only minor increases in emergency-room cases related to the cold. Most of the frostbite victims who went to the <ORGANIZATION> Fairbanks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> emergency room in recent weeks were adults who had to walk in the cold after their cars quit running, said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> McLane </PERSON>, a nursing supervisor. The victim of the boating accident was identified as 35-year-old <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clair </PERSON>. A companion who was in another skiff told the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> that St. <PERSON> Clair </PERSON> was caught in 10 - to 15-foot seas and 55 mph winds Monday evening In <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, firefighters remained busier than usual responding to reports of water-spewing pipes that broke with the cold, and a surge in residential fires, many traced to attempts to thaw frozen pipes.

<HEAD>Prosecutor to Consider Allegations Against Congressman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A county prosecutor said he'll review a police investigation involving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukens </PERSON> which a television station says dealt with the congressman's alleged involvement with a teen-age girl. <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> confirmed that <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, was under investigation. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Columbus </ORGANIZATION> television station WBNS-TV the investigation was sexual in nature but would not elaborate. `` As things stand now, the finalized report should be on my desk late -LRB- this -RRB- morning,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday night. `` We'll go through it, look at some things and decide what action to take.'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said it would probably take a week to review the report. `` Until then, I would n't want to speculate further,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, reached at his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> home by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday night, said, `` I have no comment.'' WBNS-TV quoted a <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> woman, <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON>, as saying <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> has been involved with her teen-age daughter over a period of years, beginning when she was 13. The girl is now 17, the station said. The station reported that Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> wore a hidden microphone when she confronted <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> at a fast-food restaurant in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> last November. She said <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> admitted being with her daughter and other girls, according to the report. Police have heard a tape of the conversation but would not comment on its contents, the station reported. The woman claims <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> offered her a government job as a bribe, the station reported. Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> said she would not discuss the case. `` My daughter has been through enough. She's feeling a lot of pressure right now,'' Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Columbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> in a story published today. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> served two terms in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, beginning in 1966. His district was eliminated in 1970, and he lost a 1970 bid for governor in the Republican primary. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> is from <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION>, about 35 miles north of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. After that race, he was barred from seeking public office for five years for not filing campaign reports on time. However, that campaign law was changed before the five-year period expired and he was elected to the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1974. He served in the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> until he returned to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, representing the 8th Congressional District in southwestern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. He was re-elected in 1988. In 1974, while in the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, he fought allegations that he accepted $ 1,000 in campaign contributions from <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Tongsun </PERSON> <PERSON> Park </PERSON> during his first stint on Capitol Hill. He denied the charge, presenting the results of a voluntary lie detector test he took after the allegations surfaced. Those results indicated <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> was not lying when he said he had not received a campaign contribution from Park. Park told investigators he had contributed $ 850,000 in contributions to selected congressmen in the late 1960s and early 1970s, but denied repeatedly that he was acting as an agent of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government.

<HEAD>43 Killed After Moslem Rebels Attack Village</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Troops killed at least 32 Moslem rebels in their biggest battle with the insurgents since 1986, the army said today. The guerrillas had attacked a remote village in the southern <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Field reports radioed to army's headquarters in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> said at least 11 other people _ eight civilians, two militiamen and a soldier _ were killed in Tuesday's fighting. The casualties brought to at least 62 the number of people killed in fighting in <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> island's <LOCATION> Zamboanga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> since Saturday. Military officials said 18 communist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas and one soldier were killed in six battles Saturday and Sunday in <LOCATION> Zamboanga </LOCATION> del Sur and <LOCATION> Zamboanga </LOCATION> del Norte provinces. The area has a mixed Moslem and Christian population and is roamed not only by rebels but also by bands of outlaws. Col. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Nale </PERSON>, a brigade commander who led the government troops, said the daylong battle began after about 300 rebels attacked the village of <LOCATION> Kulasian </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Zamboanga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sur </LOCATION>, 510 miles southeast of the capital, burning three houses. <PERSON> Nale </PERSON> said the rebels, members of the <ORGANIZATION> Moro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Moro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, were avenging the deaths of friends. He did not elaborate. The two rebel groups have been fighting for Moslem rule on <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> and other southern islands since 1972, but the fighting was reduced to occassional skirmishes during much of the 1980s. Rebel leaders signed a cease-fire with President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> in 1986. Officials say more than 50,000 people were killed at the height of the fighting in the mid-1970s. In his report, <PERSON> Nale </PERSON> said that shortly after hearing of the attack, military officials sent gunboats to the coastal village to prevent a sea escape by the rebels. Eight hours after the initial rebel attack, <PERSON> Nale </PERSON> reported he was aboard a helicopter gunship which strafed rebel positions and inflicted `` heavy casualties.'' On the ground, a company of soldiers encountered 35 rebels and killed one guerrilla in a brief firefight. Other troops chased the main rebel band and had an eight-hour `` decisive engagement'' near the village of <LOCATION> Tinyapan </LOCATION>, the report said. The latest report from the field said troops completed mopping up operations today and recovered the bodies of at least 32 rebels. The report said government forces also recovered 24 firearms, including five M-79 grenade launchers.

<HEAD>Students Given More Freedom To Interpret History In Soviet Union</HEAD>

 Soviet students will for the first time be allowed to present their own interpretations of history at exam time, a newspaper reported. History exams were canceled last year because textbooks have been outpaced by media reports making new revelations about the country's past Under a new system this year, teachers will be allowed to devise their own tests and students will be permitted to disagree with teachers and textbooks without being penalized, the national teacher's newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Uchitelskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> said. Final history exams were called off last year because the textbooks on which they were based were at odds with accounts of Soviet history being printed by the more-open Soviet media, including the exposure of some of the atrocities under dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. Students finishing the 10th and final grade of Soviet middle school last year had oral discussions with their teachers instead of exams. <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yagodin </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, decided history tests would resume this school year but students will be given more leeway to interpret history, <ORGANIZATION> Uchitelskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> said in its report Tuesday. `` Various opinions in all questions of the history of the country are not only allowed, they are completely natural,'' <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shadrikov </PERSON>, the vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, wrote in the article. The old tests were part of the rigid Soviet educational system that was based on rote learning.

 Plans to appoint former Soviet human rights activist <PERSON> Natan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> met with considerable opposition today. But some news reports indicated it was likely that the 41-year-old <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> would win the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>'s approval for the post. In announcing <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>'s candidacy, senior officials said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> hoped his international popularity could boost <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s image, which has been tarnished by the Palestinian uprising. Arguments against <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>'s appointment have focused on the short time he has spent in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> _ he arrived from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Feb. 11, 1986 _ and his past. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> served nine years in Soviet prisons and labor camps on charges of spying for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, charges he denies. The fear is that the choice of <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>'s for the high-profile post could insult <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> just as <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is trying to rebuild ties the Soviets severed 21 years ago over its seizure of Arab lands in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Two Israeli newspapers quoted unnamed officials in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> as warning that giving <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> such a high-ranking diplomatic post could derailing efforts to restore ties with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Israeli officials expressed similar concerns and a popular columnist for the <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> newspaper compared the <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> designation with appointing <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON>, an American convicted of spying for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, as ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> if he were freed from jail. The Hadashot and Maariv newspapers asserted, however, that the Soviets would not be offended by <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>'s appointment because the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> now has a more liberal emigration policy. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials objected to the move both out of diplomatic concerns and because it would violate a longstanding practice of requiring a new immigrant to live at least 11 years in the country before becoming a foreign diplomat. Right-wing Israeli officials were concerned that <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> was not well enough versed on the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict, citing meetings he once held with <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, a pro-PLO leader in the occupied territories. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> had said he was not aware of <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s ties to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>, the symbol of the Soviet Jewry emigration struggle, immigrated after a dramatic East-West swap of people imprisoned on spying charges. Despite the criticism, <ORGANIZATION> Hadashot </ORGANIZATION> predicted <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> would win the appointment and said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> was simply waiting for <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>'s response to the bid. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> said Tuesday he had not been officially offered the job and declined to comment. Today, <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> indicated he would consider the offer seriously. He was quoted by the Hadashot daily as saying: `` The job of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador is honorable and important and in the meantime I thank everyone who is proposing me for this lofty job. When there is really something to talk about, I will talk.'' But a government official said <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> had also indicated he was hesitant about the offer. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> was concerned about whether he could succeed despite his lack of diplomatic experience, and that his wife, <PERSON> Avital </PERSON>, objects to leaving <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> was also quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> newspaper as saying, `` I want to have a lot of children and would prefer to do so here in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>.'' The couple now has two daughters, <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON>, 2, and <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON>, two months.

<TEXT>
 A survivor of a 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> crash has been awarded slightly more than $ 800,000 in damages, about half what <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> officials say she was offered in an out-of-court settlement. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury deliberated three days before awarding $ 779,000 to <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, plus $ 21,700 for her husband, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>. The jury reached the verdict Tuesday. The couple was denied punitive damages. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> suffered a damaged heart muscle and permanent double vision from nerve damage in the Nov. 15, 1987, crash of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> Flight 1713 at <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stapleton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>. Twenty-eight people died and 54 were injured in the crash. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said the $ 800,000 award was appropriate and said <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> had approached the couple before the trial with a $ 1.6 million settlement proposal that was rejected. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said she was hopeful that her lawsuit would prompt <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> to learn from its mistakes. `` I hope it will cause reforms at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and all other airlines that cut corners,'' she said. The verdict followed nearly three weeks of testimony before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> Finesilver </PERSON>. The jury cited <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> for `` reckless and willful misconduct'' and for misleading advertising that falsely underscored the airline's concern for safety. The panel also found negligence on the part of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> because of the conduct of flight controllers who allowed the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> DC-9 to sit on a runway in a snowstorm more than 20 minutes after undergoing de-icing. The plane was bound for <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> when it crashed. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> vice president for flight operations, said <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> already has paid $ 20 million in out-of-court settlements in 36 other crash-related lawsuits. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> had claimed <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> relaxed its pilot training requirements and shortchanged its de-icing procedures to pay for market expansion and advertising. Continental has admitted partial responsibility for the crash, but said it also believed the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> was to blame because of the takeoff delay. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has ruled that the crash was caused by a combination of weather factors and pilot errors.

<HEAD>Sentences Up to Two Years For Palestinian Stone Throwers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A military court sentenced six Palestinians to up to two years in prison for throwing stones, and an army official said today that the unusually harsh sentences were intended to deter other youths. Two of the defendants sentenced Tuesday were teen-agers, and in at least three cases the punishment was for throwing stones at soldiers. No one was hurt in the stone-throwing incidents, the army official said, but added, `` Stones have the potential of causing death, just like live ammunition. `` The fact that no one was injured can not necessarily be held to the credit of the defendants,'' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` The punishment was meted out not only as a punishment, but also as a deterrent for the defendants and the general public.'' Meanwhile in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> today, four people were shot and wounded in clashes between troops and stone-throwing Palestinians, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> doctors said. The army said it was checking the reports. In Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, assailants hurled a firebomb at an Israeli bus on a main thoroughfare, wounding the driver, police said. Police blocked off the street and aimed water cannons spewing yellow liquid at nearby shops, breaking a half-dozen shop signs, witnesses said. Three Arab schoolgirls were detained, police said. Tuesday's prison terms were unprecedented in severity. In the past, stone-throwers have received only fines or jail terms of several months. The sentences for the six ranged from 18 to 24 months in prison, plus suspended terms of 18 to 40 months and fines of $ 417 to $ 833. The Israeli daily <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> said three of the incidents involved stone-throwing at soldiers. It said the defendants were aged 15 to 22. The military has tried various tactics in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> to halt stone-throwing, which army officials have called the most persistent problem since the Palestinian uprising began nearly 14 months ago. An early policy of beating Palestinians caught rioting was less used after the practice raised criticism abroad. The firing of plastic bullets and rubber-coated steel balls also was criticized by human rights groups after more than 50 deaths resulted from their use, but use of the ammunition continues. At least 37O Palestinians have been killed, most by army gunfire since the uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation began. Fifteen Israelis also have died. The sentences Tuesday are part of the latest get-tough policy introduced by the army last month. Other measures include demolishing houses of some stone throwers and permission for troops to fire plastic bullets at Palestinians running away from a stone-throwing incident or erecting stone roadblocks.

 A battle that began a year ago today when two <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> took over a small-town newspaper to draw attention to alleged corruption remains unresolved, with the two fugitives suing the state. <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, who were acquitted in December on federal hostage-taking charges in connection with the siege in <LOCATION> Lumberton </LOCATION>, filed the lawsuit Tuesday, alleging the state was harassing them by filing separate charges. The lawsuit also was filed by the <ORGANIZATION> Robeson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a group of Indians and blacks formed during the past year to voice concern about `` oppression.'' <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON>, said the group's involvement in the lawsuit shows the people of <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> `` are a changed people.'' `` No longer will they sit by and take the reign of terror and the oppression, and this lawsuit reflects their changed attitude,'' said <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON>. `` They are calling the emperor naked. That's the positive spirit here one year after the takeover.'' <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> says he does n't see an end to the standoff. `` Just because I'm not in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> does n't mean I'm not in their hair,'' he said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, where he is seeking sanctuary with the Shoshone-Bannock Indians. Brandishing sawed-off shotguns, the <ORGANIZATION> Tuscarora </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> walked into The Robesonian newspaper office in <LOCATION> Lumberton </LOCATION>, and took up to 20 hostages. They said they had evidence of law enforcement involvement in drug trafficking in <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, whose population is evenly divided between blacks, whites and Indians. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> also said federal officials were repeatedly presented with information concerning racial injustice and police corruption in <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> over the years, but failed to rectify the problems. Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> ended the siege without injuries to the hostages by agreeing to form a task force to investigate the allegations. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> were charged with federal firearms violations and hostage-taking, held in a federal prison at <LOCATION> Butner </LOCATION>, then moved through a series of county jails while awaiting trial. They were denied bond three times before a three-judge panel of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ordered their release in July. The full appeals court later agreed to reconsider that decision and ordered them back to jail. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> complied, but <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> fled and surfaced a few days before his trial in September with a lawyer from the Center for Constitutional Law in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. After a three-week trial, a federal jury on Oct. 14 acquitted the two of all charges. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> had met with the task-force panel once, but it concluded there was no evidence to back up their charges. On Dec. 6, a special session of the <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury indicted the pair on 14 charges of second-degree kidnapping. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> was arrested at the offices of the <ORGANIZATION> Robeson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that day, but <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> was freed on $ 25,000 bond, which was posted by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, but jumped bail and fled to the <LOCATION> Onondaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reservation </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> was hiding. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> later left <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> was arrested Dec. 13 outside the reservation after fleeing from a state trooper and crashing his car into an empty school bus. His $ 25,000 bond also was posted by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> failed to make a court appearance in <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> earlier this month, saying he feared for his life should he return, and his bond was ordered forfeited. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>' extradition is pending. The lawsuit says the state charges are just `` intimidation and harassment,'' and asks a federal judge to block their extradition and declare the state charges unconstitutional. It asks for at least $ 10,000 in damages from each of the 20 defendants and a judgement `` declaring unconstitutional the campaign of intimidation and harassment'' it alleges is being conducted in <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The lawsuit, which was filed by the defense committee, names <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, state Attorney General <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburg </PERSON>, and several other law enforcement officials as defendants. <PERSON> Thornburg </PERSON> said the state did not intend to stop pressing for extradition. `` It is clear that this lawsuit represents a thinly disguised effort to prevent the state of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> from pursuing the extradition and criminal prosecution of Mr. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> for holding 14 innocent people at gunpoint and against their will,'' <PERSON> Thornburg </PERSON> said. `` The state will do everything within its power to see that these individuals are extradited to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> to stand trial on state charges.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An 11-year-old showed up for class carrying a bag stuffed with 411 vials of crack that he claimed to have brought from home, police said. `` It looked almost like a lunch bag,'' housing police Officer <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLuca </PERSON> said after the boy's arrest Tuesday. The boy, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Birmingham </PERSON>, is in a class for the severely emotionally handicapped, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Berczeller </PERSON>, a teachers union spokesman. It was unclear whether the boy was being used as a drug courier or simply took the crack to the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> school to show his fifth-grade classmates, housing police Capt. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hellman </PERSON> said. Police today sought <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>'s 17-year-old brother, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, who <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> claimed had given him the drugs. `` I got it from home,'' <PERSON> DeLuca </PERSON> quoted the boy as saying. Several students saw the boy take the bag from his coat and slip it into a desk drawer, said Principal <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordasco </PERSON>. The boy was brought to the school office clutching the bag, he said. A teacher asked to look inside and found the $ 5 vials of crack, mostly in packs of 10. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON>, was summoned to the school and `` was very upset but she just wanted to talk to a lawyer,'' <PERSON> DeLuca </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> was charged as a juvenile with possession of narcotics and taken to a youth detention center. He was to appear today in Family Court. A 12-year-old brother was turned over to the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION>, said Sgt. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>, a police spokesman. Schools Chancellor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said the arrest `` reaffirms my belief that drugs are the most serious problem our young must confront.''

 A weapons manufacturer is about to give buyers a whiff of war. <ORGANIZATION> BEI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> is promoting its `` extraordinarily lethal'' Flechette rockets with scratch-and-sniff advertisements in trade publications. The ads, emblazoned with the slogan `` The Smell of Victory,'' release the smell of cordite, the aroma that follows a rocket explosion. `` My advertising usually gets lost in magazines,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Coutoumanos </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government programs for <ORGANIZATION> BEI </ORGANIZATION>, who came up with the idea. `` I usually get buried by the big guys _ the Boeings and the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION>. Who's going to read my ad when they can look at a beautiful F-16 going over the countryside?'' The rocket and electronics manufacturer is small by defense industry standards. Last year, it handled about $ 47 million in defense contracts. Specifically, <PERSON> Coutoumanos </PERSON> is trying to convince <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military buyers and other defense hardware shoppers that his $ 400 - $ 800 rockets are a better value than more high-profile missiles such as Stingers `` I'd really like to hire a major star and get them to sing and dance, but it does n't work that way,'' <PERSON> Coutoumanos </PERSON> said. `` And shooting off rockets on television is n't really appropriate, I think.'' BEI was helped in producing its advertisement by the firm <ORGANIZATION> Bozell </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jacobs </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kenyon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Eckhardt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Coutoumanos </PERSON> said the ad will debut in the Feb. 1 international editions of the Armed Forces Journal. `` Next year, I'm going to do the ` Sound of Victory,''' he said. `` You're going to run your thumbnail across some kind of strip and you will hear the explosions.''

 A man who hijacked a Colombian airliner and threatened to set fire to one of the 122 people aboard was overpowered by the co-pilot before the plane landed in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, a passenger said. Police arrested the hijacker after the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 landed Tuesday at the <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Santamaria </LOCATION> airport near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, said Interior Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Disanti </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> treated some passengers for shock, officials said, but no other injuries were reported to them or the six-member crew. The hijacker, who reportedly carried two orange juice cartons of gasoline fitted with wicks, commandeered the Ace airlines flight about 10 minutes after it left <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andres </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, for <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> identified the hijacker as Nicaraguan exile <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Siu </PERSON> and said he will either be charged in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> or deported to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. Three other passengers were questioned and released, it said. `` The hijacker during the flight told the pilot, <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, he would burn a passenger alive if he did not divert the flight to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>,'' said a Costa Rican air traffic controller, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Paniagua </PERSON>. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Campos </PERSON>, a passenger who was sitting toward the front of the plane, said passengers noticed the man when they saw he was carrying orange juice cartons and speaking nervously with a flight attendant. `` Then he spoke with the captain and told him to divert the plane to any Central American country, <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, but the captain persuaded him to land somewhere close because of lack of fuel,'' <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> said. He said the cabin door was open and passengers could hear the conversation. The co-pilot overpowered the hijacker and took the cartons away when the man looked out one of the cabin windows shortly before landing, <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> said. The hijacker's motives were unclear, but <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reloj </ORGANIZATION> reported it received an anonymous telephone call saying the hijacker was seeking the release an American and several Colombians held in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> on drug charges. The report did not identify those being held. <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garron </PERSON>, the Public Security minister, said <PERSON> Siu </PERSON> was a Miskito Indian living on <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andres </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Thousands of Miskito, Sumo and <PERSON> Rama </PERSON> <PERSON> Indians </PERSON> fled <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> region in 1981 after the Sandinista government tried to impose control on their traditionally autonomous area.

<TEXT>
 An electric stove caused the fire that killed a pro-Solidarity priest, a church official said today. `` The final results of an inspection of the scene are not available yet, but I can say the cause of the fire was an electric stove in a little room next to the bedroom,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Cezary </PERSON> <PERSON> Potocki </PERSON>. `` It even caused the floor boards to burn up. There are still a lot of questions, but to a great extent one can say the stove caused the fire,'' <PERSON> Potocki </PERSON> said. The Rev. <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Suchowolec </PERSON>, 31, died Monday from smoke inhalation in the northeastern city of <LOCATION> Bialystok </LOCATION>. His death provoked controversy because another priest, the Rev. <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Niedzielak </PERSON>, 74, died of a broken neck Jan. 21. The government said today that the inquiry was continuing into the Niedzielak's death. <PERSON> Niedzielak </PERSON> was primarily known for a shrine he maintained to Poles killed in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> during World War II, but also was sympathetic to Solidarity. The government said Tuesday it has no evidence the priests' deaths were politically provoked `` There is no ground to suppose that there is someone going around <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and spreading death among priests,'' government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said. `` There is no evidence to assume or suppose the existence of a political provocation.'' A housekeeper sounded the alarm after smelling smoke early Monday, Urban said. Another priest found <PERSON> Suchowolec </PERSON> and his dead dog lying next to a couch in the bedroom, he said. <PERSON> Potocki </PERSON> said <PERSON> Suchowolec </PERSON>'s funeral would be held Friday at the <ORGANIZATION> Immaculate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bialystok </LOCATION>, a city 120 miles north of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Potocki </PERSON>, chancellor of the <ORGANIZATION> Bialystok </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Curia </ORGANIZATION>, attended the autopsy on <PERSON> Suchowolec </PERSON>'s body. <PERSON> Suchowolec </PERSON> was an active supporter of the banned trade movement Solidarity. Early in his six years as a priest, he served for three years as a vicar in <LOCATION> Suchowola </LOCATION>, home village of the Rev. <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Popieluszko </PERSON>, a pro-Solidarity priest who was murdered by security police in 1984. <PERSON> Suchowolec </PERSON> had organized pilgrimages to <PERSON> Popieluszko </PERSON>'s grave in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zofia </PERSON> <PERSON> Romaszewka </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intervention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abidance </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Suchowolec </PERSON> had told the commission he had been assaulted and that his car had been tampered with at least twice. <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Romaszewski </PERSON>, another member of the commission which records human rights' violations, said <PERSON> Suchowolec </PERSON>'s car was stoned Aug. 4, 1988 and two days later his parents' apartment was burned. Urban said no threats had been reported to authorities.

<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After a month of public feuding, the family of brain-damaged singer-composer <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> of `` Ballad of Green Berets'' fame has agreed to the appointment of an independent guardian to handle his affairs. The agreement was announced Tuesday by Probate Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> following two days of hearings on <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>'s mental competence. While the judge agreed <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> was incompetent to handle his affairs, he said he had no jurisdiction to rule in the case because <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> is not an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> resident. At the same time, <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>'s family has agreed to let a probate judge in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, name an independent guardian, <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Bebe </PERSON>, and son, <PERSON> Thor </PERSON>, 24, had made competing appeals to be named his guardian. Under the agreement, the guardian must consult with family members before making major decisions for <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>, according to <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON>, who said relatives indicated a preference for naming as guardian a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran like <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>, a former member of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> unit, wrote and performed `` The Ballad of the Green Berets'' in 1965 in honor of the unit. He since has written a series of books on military themes. He was interviewed by <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Middleburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> on Monday. `` The responses were confusing,'' said <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON>. The 48-year-old <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>, who has a home in suburban <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, repeatedly referred to this year as 1980 even after being told the correct date, and could name only two of his three children, the judge said. <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> was shot in the head last year in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where he had lived for five years. The circumstances of the shooting have never been disclosed. Psychologist <PERSON> Gintautas </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabataitis </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> was competent but `` severely limited'' in his abilities and needed a guardian. <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> had been treated at the <ORGANIZATION> Nashville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> hospital before being sent to <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> Nov. 8 for further treatment and rehabilitation.

<TEXT>
 Students from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> today sent a letter to <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities accusing them of racism. A group of African students mailed another letter to all African embassies in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, charging <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> countries have ordered their students to stay in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> even though the students want to leave. An African diplomat denied the claim. Attached to the African students' letter was a separate protest note in which 44 African students from <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> demanded their countries let them go home. The letter-writing campaign follows a brawl between African students and Chinese on Christmas Eve in <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION>. Official Chinese reports said 11 Chinese and two Africans were hurt in the fighting at <ORGANIZATION> Hehai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Chinese students say the fight began when two <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> women refused to identify themselves as they entered the university with two African men. African students say it started with Chinese students and teachers attacking African students for no reason. In the letter to authorities, 140 foreign students from about 35 countries, including many black African countries, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, accused Chinese officials of planning the <ORGANIZATION> Hehai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> brawl and stage-managing subsequent anti-African protests in <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION>. The letter referred to developments in the first week of January, which ended with 400 Chinese police raiding a guest house outside <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION>. `` Many of us were beaten, some with electric prods, while all of us were restricted phone calls, visits from our diplomats or friends and the freedom to leave,'' said the letter. `` We were treated like prisoners as if we were guilty.'' In the letter to their embassies, African students said their countries have begun `` to threaten and order their students to go to school against the initial demand of the students.'' Hundreds of African students in <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> remain on strike. The letter called on the goverments to let their students go home. `` We could not understand how the diplomatic corps would seek to sacrifice its students for a racism-infested friendship'' with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the letter said. `` We should advise our diplomatic missions not to sell our birthrights for friendship.'' <PERSON> Kwadwo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kwakye </PERSON>, acting ambassador for <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION>, denied his country has ordered any of its 26 students to stay in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, as students charge. One Ghanaian student, <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Dosoo </PERSON>, was arrested after the brawl in <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> and jailed for a month. He was released Jan. 24, a day before President <PERSON> Moussa </PERSON> <PERSON> Traore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION>, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION>, came to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The organization had criticized <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s handling of the fight and later protests. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> initially ordered <PERSON> Dosoo </PERSON> and two other African students allegedly involved in the fray, out of the country, but later reversed the decision. One man, <PERSON> Alpha </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Gambia </LOCATION>, left. <PERSON> Kwakye </PERSON> denied students charges today that African embassies are pressuring <PERSON> Dosoo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Boni </PERSON> <PERSON> Lodovic </PERSON> to stay in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and transfer to another university. Both have said repeatedly that they want to go home. <PERSON> Kwakye </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dosoo </PERSON> is free to return home. Few of the students have money to pay their fares. More than 1,500 African students study a variety of subjects ranging from agriculture to literature in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, mostly on Chinese scholarships.

 Conch-shell horns wailed and cymbals clanged today as <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s small community of Lamaist Buddhists began three days of mourning for the Panchen Lama, their second-ranking religious leader. `` He was very good to us,'' said one young monk at <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Yonghe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, the only Lamaist Buddhist temple in the capital Most of the approximately 80 monks, or lamas, who live at the temple are Mongolian, but they belong to the same branch of Buddhism as Tibetans. Like Tibetans they looked to the Panchen Lama as their highest religious leader inside <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Panchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> died Saturday of a heart attack in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. He was 50. He was outranked in Lamaist Buddhism, generally called Tibetan Buddhism, only by the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, who has lived in exile in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> since an abortive Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule in 1959. The Panchen Lama is revered as the 10th reincarnation of the god <LOCATION> Amitabha </LOCATION>. The monks at the Yonghe Temple said they hope he soon will be reincarnated an 11th time, but one added, `` It is up to the <PERSON> Buddha </PERSON> to decide.'' The temple compound in northern <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> is a popular tourist place for Chinese and foreigners, but its huge red doors were closed today for three days of mourning. Inside, red-robed monks and a few dozen Tibetans who live in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> chanted the `` Thousand Lamp Offering'' scripture, which one monk said was an ancient scripture traditionally read when someone has died. Several monks periodically blew on conch-shell horns and beat drums and cymbals, while the chant-master laid long white silk scarves, called hada, in offering on an altar that bore a photograph of the Panchen Lama. Offerings of fruit and cakes also surrounded the photograph. The smoke from hundreds of small butter lamps mingled with incense that rose threadily in the drafty Wheel of the Law Hall. The monks, who sat cross-legged in front of the altar, gulped mouthfuls of hot butter tea between chapters. Religious authorities have not said when the <PERSON> Panchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>'s funeral will be held A government funeral committee has been set up headed by President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON>, and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s cabinet, has ordered a memorial hall be built in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> to house the <PERSON> Panchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>'s body The body remains in <LOCATION> Xigaze </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s second-largest city, where he was dedicating a shrine when he died. The <PERSON> Panchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> was educated from his teens by the communists, and was their most credible spokesman to the Tibetans. He supported Chinese communist rule in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> and generally backed their policies. However, he spoke out several times against what he considered overly harsh treatment of Tibetans, and was punished for it in the 1960s with nine years of house arrest. The government has indicated it will allow an 11th reincarnation of the Panchen Lama to be selected. Traditionally, it takes several years for religious authorities to identify a child in whom the <PERSON> Panchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>'s spirit is believed to have been reborn. Generally the child is expected to be able to identify his possessions from previous lives and has certain physical similaries to his predecessors.

 <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> said a Japanese whaling fleet it has been monitoring stopped hunting in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> today, but a Japanese official said the environmental group will not halt the fleet's mission. <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON> said the Japanese ships had stopped harpooning whales in a `` a major victory'' for the environmental organization, whose ship <LOCATION> Gondwana </LOCATION> has been trailing the fleet for a week. `` It looks like they are trying to sit us out,'' <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON> said by radio telephone from the <LOCATION> Gondwana </LOCATION>. `` They spotted a pod of 12 Minke whales but sailed right through them. Maybe they are just tired of the hassles and are waiting for us to leave.'' <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Gondwana </LOCATION> today sent up a helicopter to harass the Japanese whaling boats when the whales were spotted. On Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> ship collided with a Japanese whaling vessel. No injuries were reported. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, a whaling official said he had no reports the fleet had stopped working but said the ships may be forced to do so `` when and if it encounters harassment'' from <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> `` in a way that would endanger ... lives.'' `` Any such suspension would not mean that the fleet has stopped research whaling,'' said <PERSON> Hisashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiroyama </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. `` The fleet will not return home until it accomplishes its research mission in April.'' He said tactics used by the <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> vessel were `` tantamount to terrorism.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> says it plans to take 300 whales this year as part of its scientific research to determine the size of whale stocks _ despite a moratorium imposed by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whaling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> contends most of the whale meat will end up in sushi restaurants in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> ship, carrying a crew of 19, is visiting <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> as part of its campaign to have the frozen continent declared a world park. Another <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> Gondwana </LOCATION> will continue to shadow the Japanese fleet for another `` day or two,'' then journey to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> base at <ORGANIZATION> McMurdo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sound </ORGANIZATION>, which the group claims is heavily polluted. `` Then it will be fireworks,'' he said.

 In a subdivision one elderly resident said was no place for `` screaming kids,'' a 14-year-old girl quietly moved from her parents' home to keep them out of jail. <PERSON> Staci </PERSON> <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> moved in with her married brother Tuesday after Circuit Judge <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON> refused to block her eviction in a dispute over deed restrictions that bar children under 15.

It is. It really is. If I had thrown Staci out in the street, I'd be in jail or before a judge.'' The Elmers admit they knew that children were prohibited when they moved into their double-wide mobile home on the back streets of the rural community in 1987. The subdivision covers two blocks and is home to 17 families, all retired except the Elmers. The neighbors took the Elmers to court, and in August a judge upheld the deed restrictions and ordered Staci out. The Elmers did n't budge. Earlier this month, another judge found the couple in contempt and set the Jan. 31 deadline. The Elmers' attorney, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON>, asked for a stay until mid-March, when amendments to the federal housing law banning age discrimination take effect. <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON> refused but said the teen-ager could visit her parents. <PERSON> Staci </PERSON>, who will be 15 on April 7, is a student who makes A's and B's and spends four nights a week practicing acrobatics, ballet and other types of dancing. `` I'm not surprised,'' she told her mother. `` The Constitution is n't made for kids.'' After the hearing, Mrs. <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> packed up clothes, two blankets, <PERSON> Staci </PERSON>'s favorite pillow, a curling iron and her daughter's dance bag. `` We all love <PERSON> Staci </PERSON>, and we think it's terrible what's happening to her,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON>, wife of her 25-year-old brother <PERSON> Darwin </PERSON>. `` Staci's really close to both her parents. She's got to be one of the nicest teen-agers I've ever known.'' `` We're all elderly people,'' said <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON> <PERSON> Spittler </PERSON>, who with her husband, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, sued to force Staci out. `` Once the restrictions are broken, anyone can come in here with a mess of kids, and our quiet two streets are gone.'' `` We do n't need a bunch of screaming children,'' she said.

 A federal judge extended his order allowing Central American refugees to travel beyond southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> while their asylum requests are reviewed but said he probably will revoke it in three weeks. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Filemon </PERSON> <PERSON> Vela </PERSON>, however, warned immigration officials not to let political asylum applicants overwhelm the area again. And he said local communities should not have to bear the brunt of federal immigration policy. `` I'm disturbed about the proposition that you're saying, in effect, it's not my problem,'' <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> told attorneys representing the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> at a hearing Tuesday in a lawsuit against the INS. The judge extended until Feb. 20 an order blocking the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> from requiring asylum-seekers to stay in southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> while their cases were under review. But he added, `` It is very likely that in 20 days this injunction will no longer be in effect.'' He said he needed time to study the case. A group of immigration attorneys sued the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> on Jan. 6, and <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> on Jan. 9 issued a temporary restraining order blocking the INS procedure. The travel restriction resulted in a squalid campsite east of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, where more than 300 Central Americans took shelter under cardboard and sheets of plastic. After <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> issued his order, hundreds of immigrants fled southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, many ending up in the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area. The only issue <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> agreed to consider in the class-action lawsuit on behalf of asylum-seekers in southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> was whether the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> enacted the change without allowing time for public comment as required by federal law. <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> said he doubted whether notice and comment were required in this case. Prior to Dec. 16, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> allowed asylum-seekers who presented themselves to the agency's <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> office to travel on to their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> destinations, where they often were allowed to work while pursuing their cases. The district on Dec. 16 began requiring applicants to file claims in <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> and await decisions there for at least 30 days, during which they were not allowed to work. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hausman </PERSON> argued for the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> that the new procedure did not deny immigrants the right to apply for asylum, only changed the location for applying. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, one of the attorneys suing the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>, said asylum-seekers are better able to pursue their claims to refugee status in cities where they have relatives and friends to help them.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> today offered to withdraw <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops from some cities in the occupied territories if Palestinians accept autonomy as a step toward solving the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. It was <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s most conciliatory statement yet on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s future role in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> `` At a certain stage, when there is autonomy, the army will leave several urban centers and be focused in some other areas,'' he told reporters after addressing a group of visiting American rabbis. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> pointed out that a troop redeployment is called for in the U.S.-brokered Camp David accords, which he supports. The 1978 accords call for electing local <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> representatives to hold peace talks with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, along with representatives of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. There would then be a five-year period of autonomy, followed by further negotiations on the final status of the territories. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and many Palestinians in the territories occupied in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war reject the Camp David accords and the concept of autonomy, maintaining these ideas are intended to circumvent the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and contradict <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> demands for an independent state. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said the most crucial step in the peace process is to begin negotiations. `` Once we get to this stage, positive results will come,'' he said. But he reiterated that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will not speak to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and will not accept an independent Palestinian state. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> outlined his views as paralleling the Camp David accords, which led to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s peace treaty with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. `` The peace process will be comprised of two stages,'' he said. `` First an interim condition and this will include full autonomy. In the second stage -LRB- there will be -RRB- direct negotiations without preconditions between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> countries.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s government has been under increasing pressure to pursue a peace initiative because of international criticism of its strong policies in putting down the 13-month uprising in the occupied territories and <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s latest diplomatic initiative. At least 370 Palestinians have been killed, most by Israeli army gunfire, since Palestinians began their rebellion against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> made a series of statements last fall saying the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> accepted <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist and renounced terrorism. In December, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreed to open a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> based on <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s statements, and several of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies have urged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to open talks with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s representatives.

 <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> urged a religious group today to `` remember the past'' before embracing Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. North, delivering a hard-line anti-communist speech less than an hour before the second day of his trial in the Iran-Contra case was to resume in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, said he has `` watched in absolute amazement'' as politicians, the media and intellectual leaders praised <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. `` Until we see real changes, we must be wary of what is taking place'' in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> North </PERSON> told a packed audience at a downtown hotel. The theme of the prayer breakfast was underscoring the ties between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` Today we are being asked to ... believe that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is good and <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> is all right,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> said. `` It would be better to remember the past.'' But <PERSON> North </PERSON> called <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, `` one of the world's most brutal terrorists'' who has played a role in fomenting terrorist incidents in which Americans died. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> recently began a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. North, a former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel, is the first person to go on trial on charges stemming from the sale of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan Contras. He is charged with 12 felonies, and has pleaded innocent to the charges. At the breakfast, <PERSON> North </PERSON> cracked a few jokes about the trial, saying he could only stay a few minutes because, `` I have an appearance elsewhere that I have been invited to.'' Then he said, `` Normally in order to speak, I have to have a subpoena.'' Breakfast organizers said the event had been planned since last summer. Since he left the government, <PERSON> North </PERSON> has been speaking around the country. North praised the idea of providing military assistance to groups seeking to overthrow Soviet-backed governments. The Afghan rebels `` drove the Red army'' out of the country because they were given <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid, he said.

 Israeli troops and allied militiamen today expelled two <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> women from the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> security zone in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and placed four people under house arrest, police reported.

 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Stipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> rejected demands for his resignation at a key party meeting and called today for an end to feuding between political factions. The session of the policy-setting <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which ended today, was marked by deep divisions between reformers and conservatives over ways to overcome the country's worst economic and political crisis. <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON>, a reformer, is supported by <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> and his native <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION>, which favor political pluralism, more democracy and radical market-oriented reforms. The conservatives are led by <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s party chief, <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>. He has the support of poorer regions, which believe market-oriented economic reforms will cause layoffs at state-subsidized enterprises. After three days of quarreling, the two factions of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> agreed to hold an emergency party congress before the end of this year. The congress was called to solve the political and economic crisis and to choose a new party leadership for the next four years. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, which is trying to repay a $ 21 billion foreign debt and reduce a 250 percent inflation rate, is seeking to implement basic market-oriented economic laws. The nation also is trying to cope with a drop in living standards and an alarming increase in labor and ethnic unrest. On Tuesday, the military warned it will intervene if the crisis continues. Efforts to oust <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> were defeated Tuesday when conservatives failed to force vote on the issue in the 165-member Central Committee. But the meeting ended in a deadlock over major political and economic issues. The final decision on <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON>'s responsibility was left to the 23-member ruling Politburo, but it was highly unlikely that the body will relieve him of his duties before his term expires in June. `` We are divided on fundamental questions,'' <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrhovec </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member, said late Tuesday. He said the split was so bad that `` within the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> we already have two different, clearly ideologically defined parties.'' <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> said today the party must resolve its differences and implement `` the reforms necessary to overcome the difficult situation in the country and to enable the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to stop losing battle after battle.'' The debate before his speech was broadcast live by state television. `` We have to overcome the quarrelsome and intolerant thinking that only one truth exists and that all other opinions must be defeated,'' he said in an apparent reference to the conservatives pushing for his resignation. Earlier, <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> dismissed as `` pure fabrication'' accusations made by supporters of <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> that he is biased against Serbian interests. The session was marked by heated exchanges on the question of <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON>'s responsibility for alleged anti-Serbian statements made between his political allies, mainly from the liberal northern republics of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>'s supporters. <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> also has drawn support from the central republic of <LOCATION> Bosnia </LOCATION> and the southern region of <LOCATION> Macedonia </LOCATION>, as well as from some delegates of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s largely Albanian-inhabited province of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mihajlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pesic </PERSON>, a Serbian <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member, said that `` patriotic people and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members are asking themselves where this leadership, which has lost confidence of the people, is leading us.'' `` Can this leadership take us out of the crisis?'' he asked. The next scheduled party congress, the highest organ of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was to take place in 1990. The extraordinary congress is to take place at an unspecified date later this year.

 <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livermore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> said it has tested and interviewed employees to determine who brought a small amount of marijuana into its high-security plutonium research facility. The building where scientists try to convert fuel-grade plutonium into weapons-grade material and conduct other research has been closed since Monday, when a tenth of a gram of pot was found in a small plastic packet on the floor. The building will remain closed until the investigation is completed, said plutonium facilities manager <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Toy </PERSON>, who could not say how long it might take. The drug had been brought in past six security checkpoints and a computer-controlled security gate, Toy said. The probe centered on 10 people who had been in the plutonium lab about the time the drug was found, Toy said. The workers were interviewed by security and took voluntary drug tests, but no suspect has been identified, he said. Last year, a congressional oversight committee accused the lab of failing to thoroughly investigate allegations of widespread drug abuse. An undercover investigation led to the arrest of six lab employees in 1986, but members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and lab security officials said the probe was stopped before it reached sensitive areas of the lab, including the plutonium building.

<HEAD>Panel Chairman Reviewing Judicial Pay Increases</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs grafs 4 to CORRECT, saying Kastenmeier has made no decision
on whether to try to block pay raises for senior judges.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that oversees federal courts says he will review proposed big pay raises for senior judges who do no legal work. Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON>, D-Wis., `` believes he will have to look further into the senior judge question,'' staff member <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said Tuesday Dozens of federal judges who technically are semi-retired but who do not hear cases stand to gain large pay raises unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> rejects a government salary package due to take effect a week from today. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reported earlier this week that as many as a fifth of the federal judiciary's `` senior judges'' no longer hear cases but are in line for the increases anyway. Ms. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON> plans to review the matter soon with the subcommittee's lawyer, but `` believes he has at least a month'' to study it. Asked if <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON> plans an attempt to block the proposed raises, Ms. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said he has not yet made such a decision. <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON> heads the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on courts and the administration of justice. The pay package includes raises of about 50 percent for some 2,500 top federal officials, including members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and top executive branch employees. The Constitution forbids lowering judicial salaries. Ms. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON> is studying whether the pay raises for the senior judges can be killed after next Wednesday but before the bigger paychecks go out. A Republican member of <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON>'s subcommittee, Rep. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Moorhead </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, previously questioned the wisdom of raising the salaries of those senior federal judges who no longer handle any cases. `` It does n't seem fair,'' <PERSON> Moorhead </PERSON> said, adding that the subcommittee may want to study `` establishing some minimum work to qualify for the raises.'' Older federal judges who opt for senior status qualify for active-duty pay raises even after stepping down from full-time duty. If those judges choose the other option provided by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ full retirement through resignation _ they keep for life the same salary they received on their last day of work. Most senior judges, although lightening their workload, help the federal court system cope with the increasing number of cases. But records indicate that as many as one-fifth of the nation's 306 senior judges, including former Chief Justice <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burger </PERSON>, no longer do any judicial work. <PERSON> Burger </PERSON>, who has not wielded a gavel since taking senior status in 1986, is in line for a $ 60,000 pay raise _ to $ 175,000 a year. Salaries would rise from $ 89,500 to $ 135,000 for federal trial judges; from $ 95,000 to $ 145,000 for federal appellate judges; and from $ 110,000 to $ 165,000 for <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices. Any attempts to limit or block the raises could be covered by a 1980 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> opinion written by <PERSON> Burger </PERSON>. In that case, the court held that although <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may not thwart judicial pay raises once they take effect, it may do away with planned increases `` before they ... become a part of the compensation due.''

 An Argentine supply ship sank in heavy seas after running aground off <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>, and authorities in the region said oil from the ship had created a 10-mile slick that was killing wildlife. No one was injured in the sinking late Tuesday of the 400-foot <ORGANIZATION> Bahia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paraiso </ORGANIZATION>, which began leaking diesel fuel after striking rocks Saturday, the government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Telam </ORGANIZATION> reported, citing a navy communique. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkniss </PERSON>, director of the Antarctic program of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, said it was n't known how many gallons of oil had spilled but that it could be an `` incurable disaster.'' The foundation has said the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> could face ecological calamity if all 250,000 gallons aboard the ship spilled. `` The ship rolled over, is lying on its side almost fully below the water,'' <PERSON> Wilkniss </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s Good Morning America today. `` This is a very enclosed area. It's a bay ... bounded by a glacier and some islands and our -LRB- research -RRB- station. So if the oil goes into the area then it will have an effect on the shoreline, on the ice, on the animals, the organisms, on the sediments,'' he added. The depth of the water was not immediately known. Officials from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>, and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> research facility near the wreck said leaking fuel had killed krill, a shrimp-like crustacean that is the main food of the baleen whale and a vital part of the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> food chain. `` The krill are dying; they are literally jumping out of the water,'' the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zealand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> quoted <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON> as saying. `` Seabirds attracted by the krill are diving into the slick ... It's a real environmental disaster in no uncertain terms.'' <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON> said the information was relayed by an officer at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>, two miles from the wreck. A station spokesman, talking to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone on condition of anonymity, said leaking oil had caused a 10-mile slick. More than 300 tourists and crew were evacuated from the ship after it ran aground about 600 miles south of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION>. Salvage efforts were hampered by 50 mph winds. The ship was carrying supplies including jet fuel, gasoline and canisters of compressed gases to the Argentine Esperanza station near the tip of the peninsula, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement released in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The tourists on board were to visit the research station, <PERSON> Wilkniss </PERSON> said. `` It is an extremely dangerous passage to negotiate. There are many islands, there are icebergs at times, there are many shoals and rocks on the water,'' <PERSON> Wilkniss </PERSON> told Good Morning America. `` The ship, according to the charts we have provided to our mariners, took the wrong exit and entry ... to the station, and it was not aware and was going too fast and ran on some underwater rocks that probably were not on the Argentine chart,'' he said. The ship sustained a 35-foot-long gash in its hull, and some diesel fuel began leaking, washing ashore near <LOCATION> Palmer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>, the foundation said. The accident occurred near two areas designated sites of special scientific interest under the <ORGANIZATION> Antarctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION>, which permits international exploration of the continent, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> agency said. Before the sinking, Argentine officials had discounted a spill. <ORGANIZATION> Telam </ORGANIZATION> quoted Argentine navy sources as saying: `` The fuel it carried, both for itself and the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> stations, was in steel drums so a spill is practically impossible.'' The 316 people on board, including 82 passengers and 234 crew members, were rescued by power boats and taken to <LOCATION> Palmer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>. Most were then taken by cruise ship to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shetland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and airlifted to the South American mainland, but 104 crewmen remained at the station, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Renerie </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Meese Signs Deal To Write Memoirs of Years With Reagan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A fortchoming book by <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> will focus on `` the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> era in modern political history,'' a spokesman for the former attorney general said today. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Holt </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Tuesday that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has signed a contract to write his memoirs, and they will appear in November. The publishing company declined to disclose the amount of the advance that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> received, and spokesman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> said he did not know how much it was. <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` has been actively engaged in the process of assembling material and scoping it out for the last several weeks.'' The spokesman said he would not be assisting <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> in writing the book. `` I know that he has got somebody working with him, but I think it is more research and assemblage,'' <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> said. `` He really intends to do a lot of the writing himself.'' `` It is going to be focused on -LRB- former President -RRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and really the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> era in modern politics going back to his days as governor,'' he said. `` I would be very surprised if there is an awful lot in there about <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> personally.'' The <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Holt </PERSON> announcement in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said the book would draw upon <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s 22-year relationship with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, which began at the start of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s political career in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in the 1960s, but would focus on his eight-year presidency. In a statement released through <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Holt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said, `` There has been much written about the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, both by the media and other members of his administration, and about my activities within it. Now that that chapter is closed, I feel a responsibility to tell everything I know about the operations of the eight-year administration.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, who was named attorney general after serving as <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counselor, resigned last summer in the wake of a 14-month criminal investigation by an independent counsel, which ended in a decision not to prosecute. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> declared he had been vindicated, but a report by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsibility </ORGANIZATION>, issued last month, said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> violated ethical standards in his actions on behalf of lobbyist <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> still believed his longtime friend did nothing wrong. The <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Holt </PERSON> announcement said the rights to the book were acquired during a dinner meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in November, attended by <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>; his wife, <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON>; <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Macrae </PERSON>, <PERSON> Holt </PERSON>'s editor in chief, and <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s agent.

 Four members of an Amish community have been robbed since Jan. 22 but wo n't file charges, police said. `` They do n't like to prosecute if it will cause somebody to get arrested.'' said Sheriff <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyrdum </PERSON>. `` By doing this, they more or less encourage more to happen.'' The latest robbery occurred Monday when two men pulled a gun on <PERSON> Enos </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingerich </PERSON> and took $ 300 as he drove his horse and buggy, <PERSON> Pyrdum </PERSON> said. `` What they would do is hide in a ditch in the dark, and when one came by, jump on the buggy and rob them,'' the sheriff said. The Amish are noted for their sober dress and simple lifestyle. They reject automobiles and other modern conveniences, making them easy prey for robbers. Police have some suspects and may press charges, <PERSON> Pyrdum </PERSON> said. `` They wo n't sign a warrant, but we will. We'll prosecute. We'll use the Amish as witnesses,'' he said `` They will testify under subpoena. They wo n't swear, but they will affirm.''

 Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said today he was `` full of good expectations and great hopes'' as he arrived to discuss a summit to heal the 30-year-old China-Soviet breach. `` We are starting our negotiations fully aware of the scale of the forthcoming event,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said in a statement distributed by the Soviet Embassy. `` The title theme of the Soviet-Chinese dialogue is peace and development.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> arrived on a special <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> plane that landed at <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s old airport, now used only by top Chinese and foreign leaders. He was met by his Chinese counterpart, <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON>. The two shook hands warmly as they stood bareheaded in a biting wind. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> told reporters before stepping into his limousine he was carrying a letter from Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to Chinese leaders. He did not reveal the contents. `` I reached an agreement in principle with my comrade <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'' on holding a summit, he said. `` Now we're going to talk concretely about the matter.'' <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in December. In his written statement, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> called <PERSON> Qian </PERSON>'s visit a `` major step forward'' and added, `` We have stepped on the soil of the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> full of good expectations and great hopes.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> will meet with <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> on Thursday morning. He flies to <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> on Friday and meets the following day with <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, who is in the east coast city for the upcoming Lunar New Year. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> told the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday he was ready to conclude the agenda for a summit this year between <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>. He said he was bringing concrete suggestions for a date. Both sides have indicated they want such a meeting in the first half of the year. The Soviets have been courting <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for several years in an effort to heal their ideological and political quarrel, but only in the past year has <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> shown equal eagerness. Factors include changes in Soviet policy and a sense that not much time remains for <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, who is 84. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s 10-year occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> has been one of the main issues dividing <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. However, under apparent pressure from its main ally, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> said in December it was willing to pull out by September, and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> agreed in principle to end its aid to Cambodian rebels by then. The two other issues that have stood in the way of a Chinese-Soviet reconciliation also appear nearing resolution. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is scheduled to complete its troop pullout from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in two weeks and has announced plans to pull some troops out of <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>, its ally on the Chinese border. The last Soviet foreign minister to visit <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> was <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, who accompanied <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> in 1959. The next year the two countries split bitterly over leadership of the world communist movement and a border dispute.

<HEAD>Auditor General Fires 18 Employees in Job-Buying Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s auditor general today fired 18 people in her department who she said had bought jobs or promotions under previous administrations. The 18 people ranged from management down to the staff level in the 800-member department, and many worked in the field as auditors, Auditor General <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hafer </PERSON> said. Jobs and promotions were priced between $ 1,000 and $ 5,000, Ms. <PERSON> Hafer </PERSON> said. Investigations by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney and her staff developed a list of 25 people suspected of either buying jobs or promotions or having jobs bought for them, Ms. <PERSON> Hafer </PERSON> said. `` Today's action was the only way to lift the cloud of suspicion that has hung over those hard-working and dedicated employees of the Auditor General's Office,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Hafer </PERSON>, a Republican who took office two weeks ago. Former Auditor General <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON> and two top aides were among those convicted and sentenced to prison in the job-selling case. Ms. <PERSON> Hafer </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, said there was not enough evidence to fire 21 workers whose names were supplied to him by Acting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>. Of the 25, one was former Deputy Auditor General <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Imber </PERSON>, who is in prison for his role in the job-selling scheme; four have resigned or retired; two were fired under previous administrations but won reinstatement, and 18 were dismissed. Ms. <PERSON> Hafer </PERSON> said she could not release any other names because of concern that would jeopardize any legal action to uphold the firings. The auditor general's office audits government operations at the state and local levels.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> announced today a quota system limiting pilgrims will remain in force during this year's Moslem pilgrimage to <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s holiest shrines in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> Following deadly riots during the 1987 pilgrimage, which the Saudis blamed on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> government declared only one person out of every 1,000 people in Moslem countries would be allowed to visit the shrines. Previously, there were no restrictions. <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s parliament speaker, disclosed Tuesday that `` indirect contacts'' were being made `` to overcome the problems'' that led the Saudis to sever diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> last April. One of the key problems was the pilgrimage, called the hajj. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> was quoted by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, as saying: `` Hajj must cease to be a hollow worship and should instead be turned into an active and exhilarating assembly for the Islamic world to raise its issues and problems.'' The Saudi announcement, distributed by the official <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said that in response to queries from Islamic states the kingdom `` would like to reaffirm the necessity of adherence to the quotas.'' They will continue to apply `` this year and in the coming few years'' until expansion and development schemes at the holy sites are completed, it said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s 1988 quota was set at 45,000, or one-third the contingent it sent in the two previous years. That angered Iranian leaders, who ordered a boycott of that hajj. In 1987, Iranian pilgrims defied a Saudi ban on political activities and demonstrated in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>. Some 402 people, mainly Iranians, were killed in ensuing clashes with Saudi security forces. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> said the pilgrims died in a stampede. But <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> charged Saudi police opened fire on them. In 1986, Saudi security authorities unveiled what they said was a plan by Iranian pilgrims to smuggle explosives and instigate riots during the hajj. According to the lunar calender, hajj falls in July this year. Every devout Moslem whether Sunni or Shiite, is obliged to make the hajj if they can afford it.

 <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON> lived life as a man, performing as a jazz musician, appearing to have a wife and adopting three sons. But death at age 74 revealed to fans, friends and family that <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON> was a woman. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Ball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Dodd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funeral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday that <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON>, who died this month of a bleeding ulcer, was a woman. <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> said he informed <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON>'s adopted sons, that his `` father'' was really female so <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> would not have to learn it from the death certificate. `` I was just trying to break it to him gently,'' <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday night. `` I just did n't want him to find out in a public office. It's been a very difficult thing to handle.'' The <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> coroner was not available Tuesday for comment, the coroner's office said. `` I'm just lost,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Spokesman-Review </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. He said he learned the truth last Wednesday, four days after <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON>'s death `` No one knew,'' said <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON>, the woman that <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON> had said he married in 1960. Ms. <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON>, who separated from <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON> 10 years ago, refused to talk about their life together, saying <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON> died with the secret and that should be respected. `` The real story about <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON> does n't have anything to do with gender. He was a fantastic, almost marvelous, and generous person,'' she said. `` He'll always be Dad,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. `` But I think that he should have left something behind for us, something that would have explained the truth.'' Ms. <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON> told funeral directors that <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON> was born Dec. 29, 1914, in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and was raised in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. The newspaper said <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON> apparently began appearing as a man to enhance his chances of success as a jazz musician. `` He gave up everything,'' Ms. <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON> said. `` There were certain rules and regulations in those days if you were going to be a musician.'' <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON>, a saxophone and piano player, performed with the <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Teagarden </PERSON>, <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlyle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> bands, then formed the <ORGANIZATION> Billy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tipton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trio </ORGANIZATION> in the 1950s and played nightclubs throughout the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON>, who played drums with the trio for 10 years, recalled some listeners made cracks that <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON>, with a baby face and a high singing voice, looked too feminine to be a man. `` But I would almost fight anybody who said that,'' <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON> said. `` I never suspected a thing.'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, 27, <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON>'s oldest adopted son, said <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON> died broke and tired. `` Now I know why I could n't get him to a doctor,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` He had so much to protect and I think he was just tired ... of keeping the secret.'' `` You can imagine the pressure he lived with,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. `` Who knows? Maybe that's what gave him the ulcer that ended up killing him.''

 <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> is leaving <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s long-running `` 60 Minutes'' program to take a job at <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said today. The newspaper said `` 60 Minutes'' executive producer <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON> on Tuesday night confirmed rumors of <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>'s possible departure from the show, where she has been a correspondent since 1986. `` It's true,'' <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. `` She's my friend and I'm going to miss her. There was no immediate confirmation from <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. The newspaper said ABC News President <PERSON> Roone </PERSON> <PERSON> Arledge </PERSON> had discussed with <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>'s agent, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Leibner </PERSON>, the possibility that <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> could be a co-anchor with <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> on an upcoming Thursday night magazine show. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reportedly has been after <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> for some time, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said, adding that <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> two years ago made two separate offers to her. One was for a program of her own, and the other was for co-anchorship of the `` NBC Nightly News'' with <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. CBS kept her services with a contract reported to be worth $ 1.3 million a year, the newspaper said. When she renewed her contract, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> reportedly said she could host a revived version of the old `` Person to Person'' show that had been hosted by the late <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murrow </PERSON>. She also was to be given the chance to be co-anchor on other specials, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. Those offers died in the midst of recent personnel changes, it said. <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON> said he has not yet considered who would be <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>'s replacement on the show

 Irish Ambassador <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON> said today he hopes some foreign hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> will be released soon. <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON>, who is based in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, has been in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since Saturday trying to verify news reports that Irish hostage <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> was about to be freed. `` I hope that what was said about the hostages ... might prove to inaugurate positive developments in regards to the hostages before too long,'' he said. <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON> spoke to reporters after a 30-minute meeting in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Staitieh </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s political department He refused to comment on the talks. <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia, predicted a rapid release of the hostages in a statement to reporters in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> on Monday. He spoke after a truce between his pro-Syrian militia and the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> ended their nine-month war in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Amal-Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> accord was sponsored by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` The peace pact did not refer directly to the hostages, but I am sure that this agreement would help the release of hostages as quickly as possible,'' <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> said. Amal is not involved in hostage-taking. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is believed to be the umbrella for pro-Iranian fundamentalist factions holding most of the 15 foreigners missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> government was `` in touch with all the governments that might be in a position to render assistance in terms of securing the early release.'' <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>, 38, was kidnapped April 11, 1986 as he walked to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> where he taught English. No group has claimed his abduction. <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON> said <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>'s kidnappers have not contacted him. `` No organization has indicated who should get in touch with me or with other representatives of the Irish government on this subject,'' <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON> said. In addition to <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>, who also holds British citizenship, the captives in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are nine Americans, three Britons, an Italian and a Belgian. The hostage held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

 It took five shotgun blasts from police to drop a 70-pound pit bull named <PERSON> Mongo </PERSON> after it terrorized a newspaper carrier and charged officers. `` It sounded like World War III,'' <PERSON> Mongo </PERSON>'s owner, <PERSON> Gale </PERSON> <PERSON> Sneath </PERSON>, said after police killed his pet in the neighborhood. <PERSON> Sneath </PERSON> described the animal as an excellent watchdog and `` simply mean'' to strangers; police said it was the neighborhood bully whose nasty disposition prompted the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to enact a strict ordinance governing pit bulls. Police Chief <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Sangston </PERSON> ordered officers to destroy the dog on Friday after it chased 11-year-old <PERSON> Kara </PERSON> <PERSON> Danko </PERSON> as she delivered newspapers in this town of 15,000 located about 100 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` We'd had an ongoing ordeal with the same dog over the last two years,'' <PERSON> Sangston </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` We'd had several citizens complaints and its owner was arrested on a previous occasion for letting the dog run at large. `` We had reports of the dog chasing kids, pedestrians, the mailman and a newspaper carrier. We knew the dog was vicious and I told my officers that if the dog attacked, I wanted the dog destroyed.'' The showdown came after Miss <PERSON> Danko </PERSON> was trapped on a screened-in porch, holding the door shut to protect herself from the growling, barking animal, <PERSON> Sangston </PERSON> said. The girl called her mother, who summoned police. `` It had become a menace to public safety,'' <PERSON> Sangston </PERSON> said. `` We sent out an officer and it charged my officer, who shot the dog with a shotgun.'' Four times police shot <PERSON> Mongo </PERSON> in the body, only to see it get up and continue to advance. `` It finally had to be shot in the head,'' <PERSON> Sangston </PERSON> said. The new city ordinance requires pit bulls be chained and caged, with warning signs posted to alert passersby of the animal's presence Police have issued no citations against <PERSON> Sneath </PERSON> in Friday's attack

<HEAD>Former Mossad Chief Said a Suspect in 1973 Plane Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VENICE, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A former head of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s secret service has been named as a suspect in the investigation of the 1973 crash of an Italian military plane, newspapers reported today. <PERSON> Zvi </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamir </PERSON>, who headed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mossad </ORGANIZATION> from 1968 to 1974, was formally named by <ORGANIZATION> Venice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magistrate </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mastelloni </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Messaggero </PERSON> and other newspapers. The newspapers said <ORGANIZATION> Mossad </ORGANIZATION> was suspected of seeking to punish <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> for what <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> considered pro-Arab policies. Although he was not officially charged, <PERSON> Zamir </PERSON> is being investigated on suspicion of sabotaging the C-47 <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> plane, the reports said. The newspaper reports could not be confirmed independently. The magistrate was not in his office when telephoned by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The Israeli government today refused comment on the reports concerning <PERSON> Zamir </PERSON>, who is now in charge of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s oil refineries in <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>. However, the Israeli newspaper Hadashot quoted <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, spokesman for Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, as calling the accusations against <PERSON> Zamir </PERSON> `` a bunch of speculation.'' <PERSON> Zamir </PERSON> was not immediately available today, but his wife said he would have no comment on the report. A few days before the Nov. 23, 1973 crash, the same military plane was used to transport several suspected Palestinian terrorists to <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, the reports said. The Palestinians had been arrested at <LOCATION> Ostia </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> while allegedly planning to attack an Israeli airliner. The plane crashed shortly after takeoff from <LOCATION> Marghera </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>, killing four Italian military officials. A month ago, newspapers in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> reported <PERSON> Mastelloni </PERSON> was examining a possible Israeli link to the crash. The reports said the head of Mossad activities in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> in 1973, time, identified as <PERSON> Aba </PERSON> <PERSON> Leven </PERSON>, was also suspected of involvement but that he died a few years ago. The inquiry into the crash was reopened in 1986 after <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s former head of military counter-espionage, Gen. <PERSON> Ambrogio </PERSON> <PERSON> Viviani </PERSON>, alleged in a magazine interview that <ORGANIZATION> Mossad </ORGANIZATION> had sabotaged the plane

 A military refueling jet that crashed on takeoff, killing all 19 aboard, appeared to veer away from a cluster of houses before tipping onto the ground and exploding in a mushroom-shaped fireball, witnesses said. `` It could n't have been more than 50 or 60 feet off the ground,'' said <PERSON> Skeet </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who witnessed Tuesday's crash of the Hawaii-bound KC-135A from his back yard. `` That left wing hit the ground and -LRB- crashed -RRB- just like these pictures of atomic bombs you've seen. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Dyess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION> and at K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base near <LOCATION> Marquette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, where the flight originated, said the passengers included spouses of military members, retired military members and one child. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s Accident Investigation Board were expected to arrive at <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION> today. However, their investigation could be hampered by the fact that no flight data recorder was aboard the modified <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707, said 1st Lt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ames </PERSON>, deputy chief of public affairs at <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ames </PERSON> said he did n't know if a cockpit voice recorder was aboard. The plane's maintenance files were aboard before it crashed, which also could hurt the investigation, officials said. `` Some were duplicated, but not all,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bicking </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>'s chief of public relations. The tanker was scheduled to refuel F-16s in the air as part of a training mission before flying nonstop to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, the spokesman said. The plane then would have gone to <ORGANIZATION> Andersen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> for a training exercise. <PERSON> Ames </PERSON> said it was unclear how much fuel the plane was carrying, but added it was enough to complete the mission and make the eight-hour flight to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. The flight manifest showed that 17 of the passengers were from <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> and the two others boarded at <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION>, said Master Sgt. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Doster </PERSON>, another <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION> spokesman. In addition to seven crew members, four passengers were on active duty in the military, four were retired military and among the four dependents was one child, <PERSON> Ames </PERSON> said. Names were withheld pending notification of relatives. <PERSON> Doster </PERSON> said it was not uncommon for dependents to fly `` space available'' aboard a military flight. But <PERSON> Ames </PERSON> said, `` If they can get there by commercial jet ... there are certain regulations that prohibit civilians from flying military aircraft. There are certain exceptions to that rule.'' The plane crashed shortly after noon Tuesday near the end of the <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION> runway, near <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Highway 277 six miles southwest of <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION>. The wreckage was scattered over 2 square miles, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said initial reports forwarded to <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> commanders at the Pentagon and at the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> suggested the problem occurred during takeoff. `` It was toward the end of the roll, and he apparently had no choice but to press on,'' said one official in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` But he did n't have the power to get up for some reason,'' added another. The sources said the plane was carrying close to a full load of fuel _ what the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> calls a heavy load _ totaling 155,000 pounds. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, who witnessed the crash from his home near the south end of the runway, said he sensed disaster when he first saw the plane. He said he watched in horror through his kitchen window as the airplane struggled to get airborne `` before it ran off the end -LRB- of the runway -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> said he knew the pilot was in trouble even before he saw the plane. `` I've been watching these dudes out here for three years and you get used to the sound,'' he said. `` Right then, I said to myself, ` He's not going to make it.''' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he thought the pilot tried to steer the jet away from his home and about a dozen mobile homes. The homes are a few hundred yards from the crash site and west of the runway. `` He just turned it back to the east,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. Witness <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, 19, said the plane's crew `` never got it off the ground. ... The first thing I saw was just the mushroom of the smoke.'' The plane came to rest at about a 45-degree angle, a charred wing tipped toward the sky. Grass fires sparked by the crash burned for more than an hour. The maintenance record for the KC-135A, powered by four <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> jet engines, was not yet available, said Lt. Col. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>, a spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Headquarters </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, Neb. <PERSON> Ames </PERSON> said the plane that crashed had been in service since 1963 and was still carrying its original engines.

<HEAD>Government Will Allow Tests Of Advanced U.S. Missile Over Canada</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS defense to deterrent in 6th graf ``Officials from ....''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The defense minister said today the government will allow the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to test an advanced unarmed cruise missile over <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. `` This testing is an important Canadian contribution to the effectiveness of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s strategic deterrent,'' Defense Minister <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> said in a statement. The missile, known as AGM-129A, is more advanced than <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air-launched cruise missiles now tested in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Using stealth technology, the missile is better able to avoid detection. During the tests, the missile will be attached to a B-52 aircraft which will take off from and return to its base in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> without landing in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Opponents of the test argue the missile could be used as a first strike weapon. Officials from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and External Affairs departments told reporters today the new missile is only intended as a deterrent. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said the missile does not represent a major change in technology. They compared the modifications to those in car models from one year to the next. The missile is believed to have greater accuracy and an increased range. <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> said tests are expected to be conducted before March 31. In explaining the decision to allow the tests, <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact already has a significant and improving cruise missile capability. `` We support the pursuit of mutual arms reduction, a process that can only move ahead effectively if both sides are dealing from equivalent positions,'' he said. Under a 1983 agreement, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> allows the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to conduct as many as six tests a year of the air-launched cruise missiles. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Flowers </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, does n't think the government decision reflects Canadian feelings. `` I think the general trend in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> would prefer to see a Canadian government that's working for disarmament and not testing new weapons systems,'' he said today after the announcement was made.

 Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout the nation. Jan. 31 <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> on pay raises for retired federal judges: The federal judiciary badly needs its senior judges _ judges who ... choose to stay actively at work after reaching retirement age. But what the judiciary does n't need are senior judges, like former Chief Justice <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burger </PERSON>, who continue to draw full salary for doing nothing. ... An estimated 20 percent of all senior judges, including <PERSON> Burger </PERSON>, continue to draw full salary while doing no work. Their idleness is enriching _ to them, not us. In Burger's case, he receives $ 115,000 a year. That salary is due to rise to $ 175,000 -LRB- in February -RRB- unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> disapproves. Had he retired when he left the court in 1986, his pension would be $ 108,400. <PERSON> Burger </PERSON>'s record of all play and no work since he took senior status will dampen public enthusiasm for a pay increase. That's unfortuanate; a pay boost is badly needed ... Burger and other senior judges who draw full pay for doing nothing should be required to retire. After all, if they refuse to work, why should we pay them?

Hey, guys, in the words of a famous philosopher, sit on it. We're not buying anymore We've been through it before. Remember 1987? The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 88 to 6 against a $ 12,000 increase. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> followed suit, haranguing against this needless salary boost, and rejecting it in a voice vote.

 Jan. 27 The <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> on the border ditch: Waging war against drugs and illegal immigration with a four-mile drainage ditch on the U.S.-Mexican border is an act of desperation, with an improbable chance of success. History suggests that fortified barriers seldom stop invading armies, or discourage determined people in pursuit of economic or political freedom. ... A Tex-Mex version of a Maginot Line will not deter desperate people who think a better life awaits them. The only way to tarnish the gilded dreams about the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is to take away the jobs that attract economic refugees. Continued immigration reform and enforcement that puts a premium on punishing exploitive employers in inner cities, on the farm or the forests, attacks part of the problem.

 Jan. 26 The Record, <LOCATION> Hackensack </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, on the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s rejection of quotas: After years of unsuccessful pleading by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> limited the right of state and local governments to impose quotas to undo past racial discrimination. The ruling, which invalidates a <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, ordinance setting aside 30 percent of the city's construction business for minority-owned businesses, threatens hundreds of affirmative action programs. In the <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> case, the court was unimpressed that only two-thirds of 1 percent of the city's construction contracts had been given to minority-owned business in the past five years. ... That's a telling figure that shows obvious discrimination. <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> is 50 percent black. The court worries that such plans could breed the kind of discrimination once embodied in <LOCATION> Jim </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crow </LOCATION> segregation laws, or quotas that limited the number of Jews at colleges. The fear is unfounded. In one case, the main _ and only _ rationale is hatred and bias. In the other, it's an honest attempt to correct the systematic exclusion of black and other minority group members from jobs and public contracts. The <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> pattern should be clear. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s appointees to the court have joined in rebuking <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>. That's a message that will be heard in city halls and statehouses across the country, and it's the wrong one to send.

 Jan. 28 The <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, on federal pay raises: All the switches have been thrown, the signals set and the tracks cleared for the 50 percent congressional pay increase to be railroaded through in the dark of night on Feb. 8. ... Here's the plan. After impassioned speeches about `` fiscal accountability'' and `` getting our own house in order,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will vote overwhelmingly against the $ 45,000 salary boost. But over in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the pay issue will never see the light of day. Since both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have to vote against the raise to derail it, it will go into effect automatically. If that scenario sounds familiar, it should. This is the same scheme used just two years ago when the Democratic leadership engineered a $ 12,500 congressional pay boost, increasing lawmakers' pay to the present $ 89,500 On that occasion, the <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> at the throttle, Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, had the cheek to order a meaningless voice vote on the salary increase the day after it automatically became law. The lawmakers dutifully deplored the shameful looting of the treasury, pocketed the money and snickered all the way to the bank. It is a perfect setup. Representatives and senators can boast to their constituents of their opposition to wasteful spending, blaming their personal windfall on the salary review panel composed mostly of congressional appointees and capital insiders, a panel they created in the first place to relieve themselves of accountability. Although public opinion polls show that 85 percent of Americans oppose the pay raise, and despite tons of congressional mail opposing the raise, the big salary grab of 1989 is a sure thing.

A congressman can now fly in to a convention at the expense of some group, give a 10-minute speech, and fly back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with a fat speaking fee, up to $ 28,500 worth. The ban would prevent these thinly veiled payoffs.

 Jan. 26 The Westerly -LRB- <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION> -RRB- Sun on education in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>: In 1983, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> released `` A Nation at Risk,'' a sobering assessment of education in our country. ... The report said ... that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> students were well behind students in other industrial nations academically, that about 23 million ... adults were functionally illiterate ... and that average achievement of high school students on most standardized tests was lower than 25 years ago. ... The findings led to an unprecedented flurry of reform activity. ... Within 12 months, some 275 task forces were formed to guide reform efforts. Governors and legislators in 35 states acted to strengthen high school graduation requirements. Perhaps even more importantly, many school systems have undertaken fundamental reforms of age-old educational practices. ... We have made tremendous progress in the -LRB- past -RRB- five years ... but the job is far from done. ... We must continue to apply pressure across the board to make certain the educational reform movement keeps the initiative against the reactionary forces arrayed against it.

The deficit, <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON> says, `` ruins'' the economy. For President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> it also raises the most troubling political questions. For one thing, <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON> says, trying to reduce the deficit will force deferring until at least the mid-1990s the major improvement in living standards that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has made a priority in his program to restructure the economy. So far ... the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> era has seen a net decline in living standards, with shortages of food and basic consumer goods deepening. ... As part of the effort to cut the deficit, <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON> says, about 20 percent of current capital investment in the civilian sector will be slashed. The prospect, then, is for things to get worse before they start to get better.

 Guardian Angels leader <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON> said today local officials are preventing the organization from training its British recruits. <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON> accused <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> borough councils of `` giving in to political pressure'' by refusing to let the <ORGANIZATION> Guardian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> use their premises.

British police and some politicians oppose the New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Guardian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> coming to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, saying law enforcement should be left to professionals.

<HEAD>EPA Proposes Banning Pesticide Regulating Apple Growth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> proposed today the banning of a pesticide which regulates apple growth and increases shelf life because of a link to cancer. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, however, stopped short of ordering the chemical, which is marketed under the trade name Alar, immediately off the market because it said it does not consider the health risk severe enough for such action. Apple growers during recent years have sharply curtailed use of the pesticide, also known as daminozide, because of government concerns that it may cause cancer. But according to <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> and industry estimates, about 5 percent of the country's annual 200-million-bushel apple crop continues to be sprayed with the chemical. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, in action aimed at eventually banning the chemical, said it will begin the formal rulemaking for such a ban within 90 days and anticipates issuing a final regulation taking Alar off the market within 18 months. Officials acknowledged, however, that the process could take much longer if it is contested. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, acting <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator, told reporters there is `` an inescapable and direct correlation'' between exposure to Alar `` and the development of life-threatening -LRB- cancerous -RRB- tumors in test mice.'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said laboratory tests are not expected to be completed for another year but that preliminary results, although at times conflicting, showed test animals having cancerous tumors when exposed to Alar. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimated the chances of an adult getting cancer as a result of Alar exposure from eating apples and apple products as 5 in 100,000 but it said the lifetime risk is higher for young children because of their greater use of apple products. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> acknowledged that the agency could seek an emergency suspension that would order Alar off the market within months, but he said the agency rejected such an action because of the continuing conflicting test data, the fact that the tests have not been completed, and because of the level of risk. He said that during the 18 months until a final ban is expected the risk of an adult getting cancer as a result of Alar exposure is at most 1 in a million and the risk for a child 9 in 1 million. `` We do n't think that the added burden of risk -LRB- over the next 18 months -RRB- is of sufficient magnitude to warrant this kind of -LRB- emergency -RRB- action,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> told a news conference. <PERSON> Derl </PERSON> <PERSON> Derr </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 90 percent of the country's apple growers, said that the growers have `` significantly'' reduced the use of Alar since 1986 when the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> first seriously considered banning the chemical. He said no more than 5 percent of the apples grown have the chemical, which penetrates fruit, sprayed on them.

<HEAD>Contractor Decided Against Safety Device, Records Show</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Officials decided against installing a remote-control gas detection system for a <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> sewer project weeks before an explosion killed three men checking methane levels inside a tunnel, a newspaper reported. The <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that a memo showed that officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, which supervises <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> sewer construction, decided Sept. 16 not to order the contractor to install the $ 12,257 system. The three men assigned to check the tunnel for methane died in an explosion Nov. 10. The <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, a group of consulting firms, was created to direct construction of a <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sewerage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> $ 2.1 billion project that includes building huge tunnels for holding sewage for treatment. The report said a Sept. 9 memo from <ORGANIZATION> PMO </ORGANIZATION> engineer <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> to <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> PMO </ORGANIZATION> official, asked: `` Do you think we should direct the contractor to proceed with installation of methane gas recorder? We still have approximately 2,000 feet of tunneling remaining. Please comment.'' A handwritten, one-word answer _ `` No,'' along with the initials B.D. and <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> _ was returned to <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> on Sept. 16. The initials are those of <ORGANIZATION> PMO </ORGANIZATION> officials <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramage </PERSON>, the newspaper reported. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Santacroce </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> PMO </ORGANIZATION> official, said the contractor on the project did not feel the safety system was necessary. <PERSON> Santacroce </PERSON> said the mining would have been more than half completed by the time the system could have been installed. `` The contractor felt he had enough monitoring equipment in the hole, that he did n't need this recording device,'' <PERSON> Santacroce </PERSON> said. `` At the time, we felt, as long as -LRB- the contractor -RRB- felt he did n't need it, we were n't going to go ahead and direct him to put it in. But <PERSON> Santacroce </PERSON> stressed that the contractor, not the <ORGANIZATION> PMO </ORGANIZATION> or the sewerage district, makes final decisions on how to build a project and what safety equipment is necessary. `` We never told him he should n't put it in,'' he said. The contractor, <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Healy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> McCook </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, has a $ 12 million contract to build the 10-foot diameter sewer. Attorneys for the company said <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> will not comment until local and federal investigations are completed later this year. In September, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Doig </PERSON>, <PERSON> Healy </PERSON>'s project manager in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, wrote the <ORGANIZATION> PMO </ORGANIZATION>, requesting its advice on whether to install the remote system. A sensor in the proposed system would have advanced with the tunnel boring machine, transmitting continuous readings of methane levels to an above-ground recorder, <PERSON> Doig </PERSON> said. `` We await your direction,'' he wrote. An existing methane detector on the tunnel boring machine was programmed to shut off the machine automatically when methane accumulated to a certain level. Shutdowns occurred Nov. 7 and the day of the accident, Nov. 10, when the detector found high levels of the combustible gas. Work was halted and miners were evacuated. But because the sensor was not attached to a remote recorder, workers carried hand-held methane detectors into the tunnel after each evacuation to check gas levels.

 An <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> construction company owner told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today he paid thousands of dollars in bribes to Indian housing officials in order to get multimillion-dollar contracts on <LOCATION> Shawnee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chickasaw </LOCATION> reservations. <PERSON> Kraig </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said he tried to get housing contacts through straightforward competitive bidding but was unsuccessful until he began buying gifts and giving cash to housing authority officials and tribal chiefs. <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON>'s testimony came on the third day of hearings before a special panel of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Indian Affairs investigating contract fraud and other alleged corruption on reservations and among those doing business with Indians. `` Initially, I wined and dined them and gave them small presents like turkeys and hams,'' <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> said of his experience with officials of the <LOCATION> Shawnee </LOCATION> housing authority. Later, he said, he offered the chairman of the authority tickets to <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION> football games and was persuaded by him to do the same for the chairman of the tribe. After sending the two to the Orange Bowl with about $ 500 in cash and paid hotel reservations, <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> said he received a contract for a 50-unit housing project. <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> described similar dealings with housing and tribal officials of the <LOCATION> Chickasaw </LOCATION> nation, saying he paid $ 94,000 on phony invoices from the tribal governor's construction supply manufacturing company in order to get $ 14 million in contracts. <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> said his way of doing business is standard procedure among contractors working on Indian reservations. He also said that in order to participate in bidding for the contracts he made an employee's wife who had an Indian relative in her ancestry a 51 percent owner of his company. `` She was a housewife,'' he said. He said she never participated in company business except to sign papers when necessary. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Gevene </PERSON> <PERSON> Savala </PERSON>, a Kaibab Paiute Indian from <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, told the panel she was made president and invested her life savings in a road construction company run by her Mexican-American husband who funneled his business to a larger non-Indian firm. Now her company, <ORGANIZATION> Savala </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asphalt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, has lost the support of the backer, and she and her husband are trying to recover her $ 90,000 and keep their company alive on its own. Mrs. <PERSON> Savala </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> David </PERSON>, did not appear before the committee, but in an immunized statement read by his lawyer he said he had been urged to go into business for himself by his boss at <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refining </ORGANIZATION>. Between 1983 and 1985, the company went from earnings of $ 800,000 to $ 10 million. But in 1986 the company's backer, <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refining </ORGANIZATION>, was sold and quit bonding <ORGANIZATION> Savala </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asphalt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Savala </PERSON> said her company's revenues plummeted to $ 1 million, leaving the Savalas with big bills to pay Her story was one of several told by witnesses before the committee, which is investigating contract fraud and other alleged corruption on reservations and among those doing business with Indians. In his statement, Mrs. <PERSON> Savala </PERSON>'s husband said: `` I had no intentions of starting my own company, nor did I have the means to do so. ... `` However, Mr. -LRB- <PERSON> James </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Bagley </PERSON> guaranteed that if I created my own business, my income would at least double, and promised that I would not incur any losses.'' <PERSON> Savala </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refining </ORGANIZATION> performed virtually all of the functions of his company, including preparing bids for road projects. When contracts were awarded to <PERSON> Savala </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refining </ORGANIZATION> would be the sole source of materials for the jobs, he said. `` I would appear on site to do exactly what I had been doing as an employee of <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refining </ORGANIZATION> _ drive a truck and lay the petroleum products provided by <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refining </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Savala </PERSON> said. But when <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refining </ORGANIZATION> quit guaranteeing his company through its bonding, <PERSON> Savala </PERSON> had trouble getting contracts. He was forced to cut back, leaving him with high unemployment taxes for laid-off employees and high insurance rates based on his high-grossing years. In earlier testimony, <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> <PERSON> Begay </PERSON>, a Navajo Indian who owns a construction company in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, said most of his competitors for Indian preference contracts are fronts. `` They give him -LRB- the Indian -RRB- a pickup truck and a salary and make him Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, bidding on Indian set-aside jobs,'' he said of the relationship between the front companies and non-Indian backers. He said Indians go along with the process because it is extremely difficult for them to get bonding on their own, and without that guarantee from lending institutions, they do n't get any business. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Elroy </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent who has investigated Indian contracting, said the problem of front companies is pervasive. He said they are not prosecuted because the law on Indian set-asides is vague. `` In most of the cases the participants violate the intent of the Indian preference law, but not the letter,'' he said. He said more specific legislation is needed to give prosecutors something stronger to enforce.

 Record-cold arctic air trapped over <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> finally broke loose and barreled into the lower 48 states, dropping a bitter winter into the laps of springlike northern cities in a matter of minutes. Temperatures plunged by nearly 80 degrees in a day, with one town reporting a 23-degree drop in one minute. High winds preceding the cold front blew a toddler down a street in Lander, <LOCATION> Wyo </LOCATION>. The polar air outburst, accompanied today by blizzards driven by winds over 100 mph, stunned residents of the <LOCATION> northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, where ski slopes and ice festivals had been abandoned for golf courses and tennis courts. The frigid air, no longer trapped by a warm-air jet stream that had strayed farther north than usual and left record-high temperatures in 64 cities Tuesday, promised frigid weekend weather for the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and as far south as <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We're going to make up for the party we've been enjoying,'' said meteorologist <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Brumer </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The party ended quickly on Tuesday, as arctic air rushed into the balmy <LOCATION> northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, dropping temperatures to 10 to 20 below zero. High winds and blowing snow knocked out power in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state _ <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> got a rare snowfall in the worst winter storm in more than three years _ and parts of <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. Valentine, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, reached a record high of 70 degrees and dropped to zero degrees within 10 hours. The mercury plunged 33 degrees in one hour after the cold front passed Valentine. In <LOCATION> Russell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, which had the national high temperature of 84 Tuesday afternoon, it was 12 degrees this morning. In a 24-hour period beginning Monday morning, temperatures fell 79 degrees at <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, from 62 above to 17 below zero. The state braced for even colder weather today as the system continued southward. `` It's the coldest air mass in the last five years, since December of 1983,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Thoricht </PERSON>, a weather service meteorologist at Billings. In the town of <LOCATION> Cut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, about 100 miles north of <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> official said the temperature plunged 23 degrees in one minute, and 103 mph winds dropped the wind chill to 75 below zero. `` It was a drastic drop, really fast,'' said Glacier County Undersheriff <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Barron </PERSON>. In Lander, winds gusting up to 86 mph dragged a 2-year-old boy down the street, said his mother, <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, who chased after him. The toddler was not seriously hurt. `` He fell and the wind dragged him along on his face,'' said <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, 27. `` I was trying to hold him and trying to open the door.'' In the Plains, ranchers worked to secure cattle, particularly newborn calves, in areas that basked in temperatures in the 60s Tuesday but shivered in dangerous wind-chills down to 40 and 50 below this morning. `` It's a shock to anything's system, when you have a 100-degree drop in temperature,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beef </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. In another way, the cold snap was good news for farmers who suffered through drought last summer and faced more worries for the coming season because of the dry winter. `` Given how dry it has been, it's better to have colder weather because there's less chance of evaporation losses'' from the soil, said <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> state climatologist <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillaker </PERSON>. Blizzards hit Tuesday in northwestern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, southeast <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. Cut <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> had 5 inches of snow and <ORGANIZATION> Helena </ORGANIZATION> 4. Blowing, drifting snow dropped visibility to almost zero in parts of <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. Snowfall was light this morning in most areas, but forecasters said more wind-whipped snow was predicted in the <LOCATION> upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> tonight. The <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> state patrol closed a 50-mile stretch of highway in the west-central part of the state for nearly 11 hours through this morning, and troopers Tuesday night led about 100 stranded motorists the 10 miles from <LOCATION> Glyndon </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Moorhead </PERSON> because <LOCATION> Glyndon </LOCATION> had no accommodations for them. `` It was pretty treacherous going,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Haug </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, who drove the lead car in the convoy. `` I'm just glad I got home.'' Snow also fell in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, where Snohomish and <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> got up to 5 inches. Two inches of snow were recorded in 24 hours at <LOCATION> Seattle-Tacoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, enough to close the airport for nearly an hour this morning. About 200 minor traffic accidents were reported by early morning in the region, police said. It was <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>'s worst winter weather since November 1985, when 17 inches of snow fell in the month. Where snow did n't fall, high winds fanned a prairie fire in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> that consumed 8,000 acres and burned several farm buildings but destroyed only one house. The cold air had been trapped over <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> by a dome of extremely high pressure. The barometer at <LOCATION> Northway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, rose to a North American record high of 31.85 inches of mercury, the weather service reported Tuesday. The pressure was so high that the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> late Tuesday restricted flights over <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Airplane instruments that use atmospheric pressure to calculate altitude are not designed for such high pressure and may give innacurate readings, officials said. Before the warm jet stream shifted south and freed the arctic air, high-temperature records were broken or tied in 64 cities from <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and from northern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> into southern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Dodge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, soared to 80 degrees, surpassing the record of 76 set in 1911; <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> climbed to 65, breaking its 1877 record of 56; <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, hit 67, also breaking a 112-year-old record; <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> climbed to 60, breaking the mark of 54 degrees set in 1890; <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, reached 72; and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Smith </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, hit 77. `` The upper air wind patterns are normally different than they would be this time of year,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Severe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Storms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forecast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. `` Normally we have the jet stream across the continental <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. It's been further north. ... Weather systems could n't move through.'' Finally, he said today, `` we've had a buckle in it.'' Authorities reported no deaths or injuries directly attributable to the cold. However, on Tuesday the body of a man whose skiff was swamped by high seas and strong winds off the coast of southeast <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> was found on a beach. The warmth that preceded the cold front was indirectly responsible for the death of a <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> woman Tuesday aboard a sled that sank in a lake where warnings had been issued several times about untrustworthy ice.

 The judge in the Iran-Contra trial of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> said today he was considering a contempt-of-court citation against an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> correspondent who presented excerpts of <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s immunized testimony to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on television Tuesday night <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> suggested the action `` appears to be a deliberate effort to obstruct'' the selection `` of a jury in this case.'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said that on the broadcast, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> `` took pains'' to tell viewers that if they looked at his broadcast of excerpts of testimony North gave <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 under immunity, they would not have to serve on the jury. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he has `` not made up my mind'' as to whether the incident provides an `` appropriate basis for a contempt action.'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> was not in the courtroom as <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> spoke. `` I really am quite puzzled by it,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> bureau chief, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, said of the judge's statement. `` <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> reported fairly and accurately what has been said in public, in public testimony by Col. <PERSON> North </PERSON>. And last night we and other news organizations reported that in explaining the case and how it came to trial.'' `` Our only deliberate effort is to accurately and fairly report on the trial of Col. <PERSON> North </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said. The judge's comments underscored the difficulty of selecting a jury at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial. Immediately after <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s comments, the judge disqualified a woman who was employed at a <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> store in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> from being a potential juror in the North case because she worked in the basement where dozens of TV sets were turned on when <PERSON> North </PERSON> was testifying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in July 1987. The woman said she `` heard something'' about <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> shredding documents, but it was unclear from her answer whether she had actually seen those references as <PERSON> North </PERSON> testified or heard news accounts of it later. Defense attorney <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said he shops at that particular <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> store and that there are `` hundreds of TVs'' in the basement where the woman works in the housewares department. Later in the morning, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> added four other people to the pool of potential jurors, bringing the total to 11 of the 50 the judge wants to have from which to choose. One was a postal clerk who said it would be a financial hardship for her to serve on a jury because she was working part-time and would not be paid while she was absent. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he might intervene to make arrangements. A second was a laboratory technician. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> brushed aside defense objections that the woman had seen <PERSON> North </PERSON> testifying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on TV, but she said she had not heard what he said. `` I have to take into account your client was on TV a great deal under all kinds of circumstances,'' the judge told defense attorneys. `` She did say she saw him, but she did not say she heard him.'' The third person chosen, an Army veteran of the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war, said he could not recognize <PERSON> North </PERSON>, who sat across the courtroom. The fourth was a woman who has been a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> mail clerk for the past 16 years who said she had heard <PERSON> North </PERSON> was `` going to trial'' but `` did n't really pay attention'' to what the charges were. She said she had been `` on vacation in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'' during the first part of North's televised congressional testimony in 1987. Meanwhile, <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers say any jury in the Iran-Contra case should be kept in isolation for the entire time the fired <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide is on trial, which could be for five months. A request to sequester the jury was made by <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> on Tuesday, the opening day of <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial, as <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> qualified seven people to be part of a pool of potential jurors. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said that `` in the event a jury can be empaneled, it should be sequestered immediately to minimize the potential for exposure to immunized testimony and to protect Lt. Col. <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s constitutional rights. At a Jan. 9 hearing, prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> estimated it would take six to eight weeks to present evidence against North while <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> estimated it would take two to three months to present the defense's case. North faces 12 felony counts including lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 and 1986 to cover up <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration assistance to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels during a period in which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had banned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the insurgents. North's lawyers have said that no jury can be empaneled that would provide him with a fair trial because the former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide later testified about his activities in nationally televised hearings before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1987. In that testimony, <PERSON> North </PERSON> detailed many of his activities, such as shredding documents and cashing travelers' checks intended for the Contras, for which he is now accused of crimes. `` There has been repeated, widespread dissemination of Lt. Col. <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s immunized testimony for more than 18 months,'' said <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. North appeared before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> under a limited grant of immunity, meaning the testimony itself could not be used to prosecute him. However, under the arrangement, special prosecutor <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> was allowed to gather much of the same information independently. Over protests from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> on Tuesday approved seven potential jurors out of an initial group of 54. One of the seven, a retired postal clerk, said she paid as much attention to <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s televised testimony as she paid to `` The Three Stooges.'' She said her house had burned down and she was occupied at the time with itemizing household items that had been lost. Another potential juror approved by <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has a son who delivers newspapers for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> objected that the woman must have seen headlines during <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s testimony. But <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> placed her in the jury pool after being assured that she would cut off her son's conversation if he ever starts talking about the North case. An unemployed man looking for work as a security guard also was ordered into the jury pool. He said he saw North on television during the congressional hearings but knew nothing about him. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> objected to the selection, saying that `` if he heard even one'' small portion of North's testimony, `` which he very easily could have,'' he should be disqualified. In addition to charges that he lied to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> North </PERSON> is accused of lying to the attorney general about his role in diverting millions of dollars to the Contras from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's secret weapons sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> He also is accused of ilegally accepting a $ 13,800 security system at his home from co-defendant <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, converting to his own use at least $ 4,300 in traveler's checks from <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> and conspiring to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> of tax revenue by using a tax-exempt foundation to funnel money to the Contras.

<TEXT>
 A new survey on a controversial 50 percent pay raise for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and top federal officials concluded today that about 62 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would oppose the increase if it came up for a vote. The survey, by groups opposed to the pay raise, was released as <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> conducted his own questionnaire on the pay issue that left open the possibility of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who had planned to allow the increase to become law Feb. 8 without a vote in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, now says members can have a vote if they express that view in the survey. But the speaker said he expected members to tell him what they already communicated privately: they want the raise without a vote, even if the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> defeats the pay hike as expected this week. The raise would become law Feb. 8 unless both houses vote to stop it. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would have their salaries increased from $ 89,500 to $ 135,000. The new survey said 270 House members, or about 62 percent, said they would oppose the raise if it came to a vote. Forty-seven, or about 11 percent, said they would support the raise; 75 members, about 17 percent, declined to state a position, and 41 members, about 9 percent, declined to respond. Of those willing to take a position, 85 percent said they opposed the raise, according to the survey, conducted by <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION>, a consumer advocacy group founded by <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>; the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxpayers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, a non-partisan organization of fiscal consdrvatives; and <ORGANIZATION> Coalitions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative organization headed by activist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wey </PERSON>; rich. `` A failure to vote on this issue would be a fundamental breakdown of democracy,'' said <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Claybrook </PERSON>, president of Public Citizen. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said Tuesday he ordered his survey to prove he is not a dictator preventing a vote, but a leader who is following the private wishes of members. While House members were sending their survey answers to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> opponents of the raise told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that the increase was too big, and that the system was flawed by allowing it to become law without a vote. Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, said the system sets a bad example for young Americans and commented, `` What must they think of us, when we run from accountability, as cockroaches run from bright light?'' `` A pay raise without a timely vote in both houses is stealing,'' he said. Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION> said he was worried about <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' reputation because, `` People all over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are saying, ` They're a bunch of crooks'. But committee member <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, said the raise was needed, especially for judges and federal officials. `` What does it cost government to have incompetent people at the top?'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> asked. Tuesday, supporters of the pay plan urged that the increase at least be approved for judges and top federal executives, even if lawmakers are unwilling to raise their own salary. The raise will become law a week from today unless both houses vote to stop it. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said senators will vote Thursday or Friday, and an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Survey indicates at least 88 of them will oppose the raise. Should the raise become law, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would each vote immediately afterward on measures to bar outside income, including speaking fees, according to congressional leaders. While opponents said they would try to have <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> rescind any raise that became law, they would have a rough time convincing colleagues to take such action once the speaking fees, known as honoraria, are banned. Lawmakers would be reluctant to accept the net loss of income if their raise and honoraria were taken away. <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leadership sources, speaking only on condition they not be named, said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> acted on his own to order the survey, with Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., and Majority Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., apparently cool to the `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> -RRB- became the lightning rod'' for editorial writers and voters who criticized a no-vote strategy, even though the tactic had quiet, bipartisan support, said one leadership source. `` He's been concerned about the misconception the speaker is preventing a vocal majority of members from voting on something they want to vote on. In fact, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> told reporters: `` Over the past several weeks, I have heard from many members on both sides of the aisle. I have a pretty good idea of how they feel. They support ` regular procedure,''' a term that means a lengthy process that would make it impossible to vote by next Wednesday. But when asked if he would permit a vote should members surprise him and demand one, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, `` If the members want it, yes, of course.'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, who is directing bipartisan negotiations on a package of outside income restrictions, said the talks are focusing on these areas: _ Honoraria travel. Negotiators are looking at a time limit on travel for members invited to speak, thus preventing somene from receiving a week at a posh resort for making a single speech. However, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said there would be exceptions for multi-day events. _ When to end the `` grandfather'' loophole in campaign financing law. The loophole has allowed 190 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members who were in office as of Jan. 8, 1980, to stockpile more than $ 39 million in surplus campaign money for their personal use. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said there is sentiment, although no agreement, to allow members to retire with their cash at the end of their current term and then bar personal use of the money starting in January 1991. _ Restriction on outside income other than honoraria. Probably the toughest part of the proposal, negotiators are trying to decide how to restrict attorneys' fees, book royalties and other earned income. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said it was possible that some forms of income, like attorneys' fees, would be banned altogether while a percentage limitation would be placed on outside earnings not under the ban.

 Villagers in southern <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION> are fleeing into the <PERSON> bush </PERSON> to avoid contact with a medical team monitoring the spread of AIDS and counseling victims of the killer disease, a doctor said Wednesday. `` They think we are going to give them injections that will eventually kill them, and that the injections would keep others sexually impotent for the next nine years,'' said Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sserwadda </PERSON>, leader of the team.

 Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Noburo </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> may bring to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> a new proposal for handling U.S.-Japanese trade disputes, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration said Wednesday. A senior administration official said exact contents of such a plan were not known, but that the administration generally was content with existing trade arrangements and laws. `` But that does n't mean we're not willing to look at any new suggestions the prime minister may bring with him,'' the official said. `` And we certainly will do that.'' The official briefed reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s upcoming visit under ground rules that his name not be used <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, the first foreign leader to meet with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, arrives Thursday for a two-day `` working visit.'' After leaving <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, he plans to visit <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s predecessor, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The administration official was asked about news reports in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> would bring along a new proposal for setting up a U.S.-Japanese panel to oversee trade dispute between the world's two largest economies. `` He may be. We do n't have them -LRB- the proposals -RRB- as of now. We'll see what he comes with We have indications that he may have something, but I do n't know what it is.'' However, the official said, `` We believe we do have a great many mechanisms now that are working in the ways in which we negotiate and discuss and try to settle the issues we have in the trade area.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has special trade-dispute settlement agreements with two nations: <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is the world's largest trading imbalance _ more than $ 50 billion annually for the past several years. At Wednesday's briefing, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said that `` given the scale of our relationship, it's only natural that we have problems and specific complaints that must be handled.'' He said that while the trade shortfall with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> had eased slightly in recent months, `` it is still very enormous. And we still have to work on it.'' `` We have specific issues with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in terms of opening their markets,'' the official said.

 Defense Secretary-designate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> today denied allegations that he has a drinking problem, telling the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> he is a `` man of some discipline.'' Conservative activist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> said Tuesday that he had `` on a number of occasions'' seen Tower publicly inebriated and in the company of women other than his wife. But in a closed committee session this morning, Sen. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., said Tower denied that he was a womanizer, had drinking problems or that past business ties with military contractors would hamper his work Tower later responded to the allegations in an open session. Asked by Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., the committee chairman, if he has drinking problem, the nominee replied: `` I have none I'm a man of some discipline.'' Tower said it is `` essential that the secretary of defense be at all times capable of exercising the duties of the office.'' The nominee was also asked whether he would tolerate discrimination or sexual harassment of women in the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. He replied that he would have `` zero tolerance'' for such practices and that `` professional women would be afforded the respect and deference they deserve.'' He added that he does not envision seeing women in a combat role. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said at the conclusion of the hearings that the committee would vote on the nomination on Thursday. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> began the open session by reading a letter from <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, the counsel who handled President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s transition, in which <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> denied that the office received letters `` containing specific allegations of impropriety concerning Senator Tower.'' <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> had testified that the office received letters questioning Tower's moral character but they had not been brought to the attention of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> or <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. At the start of this morning's closed session, Tower was allowed to respond to <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON>'s allegations, <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON> said. Tower `` said that he does not feel that he has problems, as have been characterized by people upstairs -LRB- in open session -RRB- and personally feels himself to be a strongly disciplined man,'' he continued. `` I do n't know of anybody who suspected that he did have a drinking problem. He stated his viewpoint that he did not,'' said Wallop. `` I think everybody in there is quite satisfied about his lifestyle.'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> expressed chagrin Tuesday after <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> testified that `` on a number of occasions'' he had seen Tower publicly drunk and in the company of women other than his wife. Tower has been divorced twice. In other confirmation proceedings Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved the nomination of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> secretary, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> secretary and <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> as special trade representative. The vote was 100-0 on all three nominations. Also Tuesday, the White House asked for a rare delay in confirmation hearings for <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> to be health and human services secretary, and said it had nothing to do with the flap over the nominee's views on abortion. Tower said last week in two days of testimony that he received fees of more than $ 1 million for consulting work for seven defense contractors, including such industry giants as <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Martin-Marietta </ORGANIZATION>. The committee has been expected to approve Tower to head the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, and there was no immediate indication that <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON>'s remarks would change that. Tower, a 63-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION>, served 24 years in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and was chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> from 1981-85. Members emerging from Tuesday's closed session sounded unimpressed with the testimony from <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> and another witness, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a senior fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> Fulbright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION>, said he had heard rumors about Tower's personal life from delegations traveling to `` A number of allegations prove to be wrong,'' said <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, who added that the committee is `` continuing to pursue all allegations.'' Tower refused to comment as he left the committee's offices. Tower was not present when <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> took the witness chair and uttered in public the allegations that had been the subject of rumors for several weeks while President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was deciding on a candidate to head the Pentagon. `` Over many years, I have encountered the nominee in a condition lacking sobriety as well as with women to whom he was not married; I recognize senators' wives because I worked here in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for many years,'' <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> said. `` I did encounter this on a number of occasions.'' Tower was dogged by allegations of drinking and womanizing before his nomination was announced. In divorce papers filed by his second wife, <PERSON> Lilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Cummings </PERSON>, Tower was accused of `` marital misconduct.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has defended Tower, saying an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> background check found nothing that would prevent him from serving as defense secretary. When he announced the nomination he dismissed `` a lot of rumors that proved to be groundless.'' Elsewhere on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, Republicans and <PERSON> Democrats </PERSON> joined in praising the three <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration appointments they approved Tuesday. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> is a longtime friend of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s who raised millions of dollars for the Republicans in last year's campaign. Ms. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> was the secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> during the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> administration during the mid-1970s, and has practiced law in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> since. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> was the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>, which includes the mass transit system serving <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. He is also a political ally of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> and served as a campaign aide in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s bid for the White House. Discussing the request to delay the <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> hearing, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration has asked for more time for more background checks. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> upset anti-abortion leaders twice in recent weeks when remarks attributed to him indicated he was not an adamant foe of abortion.

<HEAD>Bush Nominates Appeals Court Judge Starr as Solicitor General</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Wednesday he will nominate conservative federal appeals judge <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> to be solicitor general, the government's chief representative before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>'s willingness to give up his lifetime appointment on the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> was seen in legal circles as a good way to put himself in the running for a future nomination to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Following a similar route, <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> gave up a federal judgeship to become solicitor general in 1965, and two years later he was named by <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> to the high court. At 42, <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> is regarded by many courthouse observers as too young to want to spend the rest of his career on the <LOCATION> D.C </LOCATION>. Circuit. However, there may be political risks in the solicitor's job if <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> eventually wants to go to the high court. As solicitor general, <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> likely would be the person to urge the high court to overturn its 1973 abortion-rights decision _ a position that could elicit strong opposition from pro-abortion forces if he is later nominated as a justice. <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> was a clerk for former Chief Justice <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> and later a partner with the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> law firm of <ORGANIZATION> Gibson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dunn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Crutcher. He served as counselor to then-Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> from 1981 until his appointment to the <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> appeals court in 1983. The solicitor general is the government's chief appeals lawyer, arguing cases before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and deciding whether to appeal lower court decisions against federal agencies. If confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> would succeed <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Fried </PERSON>, who resigned to return to <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 A Sudanese rebel leader met with <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials recently as part of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort to end <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s civil war that has left millions in danger of starvation, officials said Wednesday. <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalid </PERSON>, who serves as the foreign envoy of the <ORGANIZATION> Sudanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, arrived in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last week and asked to meet with representatives of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s new administration, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Khalid </PERSON> spoke on the telephone with officials of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said White House officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. He also met with <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON>, who heads the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's Foreign Disaster Assistance program and has been pressing both sides to allow relief convoys safe passage from <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> into famine areas, said a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, also speaking only on condition he not be named. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Khalid </PERSON> has been here before and that his meetings did not reflect a change in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy. <PERSON> Khalid </PERSON> has said he knows <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> from the days both represented their governments at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in 1971 and 1972. Until recently, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government had carefully avoided taking sides in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, angering congressional critics who charged that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was allowing foreign policy considerations to overrule humanitarian needs. <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> delegations to <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> in recent weeks have been told that as many as 500,000 Sudanese died last year of hunger. In recent months <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have been taking a slightly more critical approach toward the Sudanese government of <PERSON> Sadiq </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> after he refused to support a tentative cease-fire pact signed by one party in his coalition government. <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> has been pressured by Moslem fundamentalists in his government to reject any pact with the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> and animist rebels. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been urging the Ethiopian-backed <ORGANIZATION> SPLA </ORGANIZATION> and the government of <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> to negotiate an end to their five-year war and to allow foreign relief supplies to reach starving Sudanese in the southern part of the country. The Sudanese government has supported past <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> discussions with the rebel group and was informed of the meetings with <PERSON> Khalid </PERSON>, said one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official. He said the two sides in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> are also talking with each other. In an effort to bring pressure on <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> have been talking more frequently to <ORGANIZATION> SPLA </ORGANIZATION> representatives, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has also been urging the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to get involved in efforts to end the war. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> enjoyed military basing rights and close ties with the Sudanese government of <PERSON> Gaafar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON>, but relations with <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> deteriorated after he was deposed in a 1985 coup.

<HEAD>Striking Teachers Bring Schools, Universities to a Standstill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Striking teachers kept more than 1.5 million students out of schools and universities throughout the country Wednesday, bringing education in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> to a standstill for a second time this year. About 6,000 private school educators also walked off the job to protest a proposed law they say will abolish private education in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. In downtown <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, about 2,000 government-employed teachers staged a protest march pressing demands for a 16 percent pay increase and more government spending on education. Union officials said teachers would stop striking Friday. Their actions stopped midyear exams for 100,000 students in the 17 state-run universities. University professors are demanding a 50 percent increase on salaries averaging $ 566 a month, which they claim have devalued 50 percent since the socialists won power in 1981. The action came amid growing concern by parents and private school administrators who have threatened to close their schools if the government passes a law strengthening its control of finances, management and running of private schools. More than 100,000 pupils attend 486 private shools around <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>.

 A worksheet of calculations by Admiral <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> provides no evidence he faked his claim of reaching the North Pole in 1909 but does n't end the debate on whether he actually reached his destination, the head of a foundation hired by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> announced today. Retired Rear Adm. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, presented a new interpretation of a single sheet of <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s handwritten navigational notes. <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> astronomer and historian <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rawlins </PERSON>, in a 1970 article and a 1973 book, had argued that <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> faked his claim to have discovered the pole. Most recently, in October, he cited the worksheet as further evidence of fraud. <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> said, `` The piece of paper provides no evidence <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> faked his claim.'' But he added, `` This worksheet says absolutely nothing about whether <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> reached the pole.'' He said debate about <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> will continue as the foundation reviews other pieces of data from the expedition in its investigation. <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> said three experts _ evaluating the single document only _ found the calculations are not from 1909, as believed from the envelope in which they were found, but from an earlier polar expedition made in 1906. He said <PERSON> Rawlins </PERSON>' `` sensational claims'' are not proved by the calculations. Further, <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> said that one set of numbers that <PERSON> Rawlins </PERSON> interpreted as compass readings taken as part of celestial observations were actually serial numbers found on the face of a chronometer taken on the polar expedition. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosvenor </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, attacked <PERSON> Rawlins </PERSON>' claim that <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> deliberately faked his results. `` Suggesting <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> might not have reached the pole is one thing; declaring him a fraud is another,'' <PERSON> Grosvenor </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Grosvenor </PERSON> said that in commissioning <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> and the foundation to carry out the study, `` I told him, let the chips fall where they may.'' National Geographic previously asked <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON>, a British polar explorer to investigate <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s claims. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> published an article last year saying he found that <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> was 30 to 60 nautical miles off course. <PERSON> Rawlins </PERSON> earlier had found <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> came no closer than 121 miles but because of difficult conditions and low supplies felt pressured to say he had discovered the North Pole.

<HEAD>Plan to Appoint Sharansky as Ambassador Gets Opposition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Newspapers on Wednesday criticized the nomination of <PERSON> Natan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s next <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, saying the appointment of the human rights activist and former <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> prisoner could hurt relations with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Senior Israeli officials, who announced <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>'s candidacy Tuesday, expressed hope that <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>'s popularity would help boost <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s image, which has suffered during the 13-month Palestinian uprising. But leading Israeli newspapers said <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> is not the right man for the job. They cited <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>'s lack of experience in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and said the appointment of a man convicted of anti-Soviet espionage would offend <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, which only recently began to improve ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> after a 20-year diplomatic break. The appointment of <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>, 41, would have to be approved by Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, head of the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and by the coalition <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>. Two Israeli newspapers quoted unidentified <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials as warning against derailing efforts to restore ties with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> by giving <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> such a high-ranking diplomatic post. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> `` has barely managed to become rooted in the country's landscape and has n't yet found his proper place in Israeli society,'' said the mass-circulation daily <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> The appointment `` is liable to be interpreted as a superfluous provocation of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' the newspaper said. Other criticism focused on <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>'s personality, with the daily <ORGANIZATION> Maariv </ORGANIZATION> saying the appointment could prove risky because `` <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> will not settle for serving as a mouthpiece ... He is an individualist whose opinions can not always be foreseen.'' The paper apparently was referring to <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>'s somewhat independent stand on the Palestinian problem, including his meetings with pro-PLO figures in the occupied lands.

Western observers believe the espionage charge was in fact punishment for his political views. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> dodged reporters' questions Wednesday. Asked about the reported appointment, he said `` No comment, no comment'' as he left a <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> hotel after addressing North American rabbis. After the speech, one of the rabbis addressed <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> as `` Mr. Ambassador.'' <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> smiled and said: `` I'm glad you accept that I'm the ambassador of Soviet Jews here in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.''

 A military judge today convicted a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> platoon sergeant of negligence in the death of a soldier who had been left behind in the <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> during a training exercise in August.

 Police increased security around <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities Wednesday after student radicals vowed a new wave of demonstrations the week President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arrives on an official visit. The government warned it wo n't tolerate further acts of violence against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and other foreign facilities. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Headquarters </ORGANIZATION> ordered its units to deploy more police around 13 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and other major cities and to increase street checks on pedestrians. In the most recent attack on Tuesday, 50 radical students, shouting `` Yankee go home!'' hurled dozens of firebombs at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cultural center in the opposition stronghold of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>. Nobody was hurt. The center in southern <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has been attacked 26 times since 1981, including six times in 1988 alone. `` Security was increased within a radius of 100 yards from all concerned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities and more martial arts-trained plainclothes men were desployed,'' one police official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. In a special statement Wednesday, the government regretted repeated attacks by radical students on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cultural center and warned that further violence would not be tolerated. `` The use of physical violence against a foreign facility can in no way be justified,'' said the statement issued by Culture and Information Minister <PERSON> Choe </PERSON> <PERSON> Byung-yul </PERSON>, the government's chief spokesman. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, a nationwide radical group, defied the government warning and said it would start a major protest campaign Feb. 25, the first anniversary of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s government and one day before a visit by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he will visit <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Feb. 26 after stopping in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and attending the funeral of Japanese Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The government statement came amid growing public concern about escalating anti-Americanism in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, where 40,000 American troops are stationed. Anti-Americanism has been fanned by disclosures of corruption and human rights abuses under the U.S.-backed government of former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>. Many opposition and dissidents claim the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was involved in the military suppression of a 1980 civil uprising in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, in which 200 people were killed. They also claim that the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> incident was instigated by <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, then an army general, as part of his efforts to seize power. Opposition parties and major newspapers joined the government in denouncing the recent attacks on the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> center. Two leading Korean-language newspapers ran editorials under the headline `` No Firebombs.'' `` The government is convinced that such acts of violence clearly run counter to the wish of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> people as a whole,'' said the government statement. `` The students should exercise self restraint to prevent such incideents in order not to damage traditional Korea-U. friendship.'' The Party for <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, the largest political opposition, issued a statement regretting the attack and asking the redical students, who lack broad public support, to avoid violence. `` We fully understand that the students want to address the past wrongdoing, but the matter should be peaceful and rational,'' it said.

Detective <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoch </PERSON> on Wednesday gave this account of the incident: The victim, a 21-year-old nursing student, said she was awakened in her bed July 17 by a man sexually assaulting her. Afraid she would be hurt, she tried to befriend the man, who asked for her name and telephone number. She gave him both. The man apologized and asked the woman what he could do to make amends. She said she needed an air-conditioner; he said he would get her one and left. The next day the woman returned to her apartment with a police officer. On her answering machine they found two messages that she said had a voice matching the rapist's. In one message, the man said he was `` Steve'' and was calling to arrange delivery of the air-conditioner. The man phoned the victim later and spoke with her in person, and she obtained enough information for police to search <PERSON> Bunner </PERSON>'s apartment and arrest him the next day, <PERSON> Hoch </PERSON> said A used air conditioner that was not hooked up was found in the apartment, the officer said. <PERSON> Bunner </PERSON> confessed to the rape after being confronted with the answering-machine tape, said <PERSON> Hoch </PERSON>. He later confessed to assaulting another woman in 1987. Under Tuesday's sentence <PERSON> Bunner </PERSON> will be eligible for parole in 13 years.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to pay for an accelerated, $ 456 million cleanup of buried nuclear waste at its <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, Gov. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> announced today. The agreement came more than three months after the governor closed <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s borders to temporary storage of nuclear waste. At a news conference, <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> said negotiations with DOE since the Oct. 19 ban led to the commitment to the 5 -LCB- - year cleanup Before the talks began, the department planned to spend only $ 29.6 million through fiscal year 1991. `` This is a tremendous step forward in the effort to completely remove years of accumulated buried waste,'' <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> said. `` The department's commitment of significant new resources indicates that <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> understands how important cleanup is to <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and to the nation.'' However, the governor said he will not reconsider his ban on waste shipments until legislation is introduced in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to begin the land withdrawal process necessary to open the <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION>'s permanent storage site near <LOCATION> Carlsbad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION> `` Until that time, the borders remain closed,'' <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> said. About 2 million cubic feet of transuranic, low-level radioactive and other hazardous wastes buried beneath the laboratory, some of it since the 1950s. Some cleanup work has been under way since 1987 when tests found contamination in the aquifer under the site. <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> said today's announcement means the cleanup will be sharply accelerated. The DOE has agreed to spend $ 33.9 million on cleanup in the current fiscal year, through Sept. 30; $ 62 million in fiscal 1990, and $ 89.9 million over each of the following four years. The money is subject to congressional approval. The faster cleanup and increased funding, along with <PERSON> DOE </PERSON>'s agreement to conduct an epidemiology study around the lab and its initiation of land withdrawal action on the plant in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, means three of <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON>' four conditions for reassessing his ban on waste shipments have been met The governor, who previously blasted <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> for failing to keep repeated promises to clean up the laboratory, said he was confident he could trust the department to follow through on its latest commitment. `` There are plenty of opportunities for the state of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> to see the DOE keeps its word this time,'' <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> said, mentioning some unspecified `` cards that have not been played yet.'' Laboratory manager <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Ofte </PERSON> said research is under way to find the safest and most effective ways to get to the buried waste. But he said it may be two or three years before the first shipments begin leaving the site.

 Moslem guerrillas pounded a convoy of Soviet trucks and tanks with artillery fire on Wednesday as it headed toward the border in the final phase of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Rebels also fired three rockets into the capital, but there were no reports of injuries or deaths, government officials said. The government also said the army opened fire to stop a fight that broke out Tuesday when several people tried to cut into a long line at a gasoline station. Officials said two people were killed and three injured, but witnesses said at least eight pople died and 35 were injured. In <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>, the nation's second-largest city, 400 Afghan troops defected to the insurgents during rebel assaults over the weekend and two helicopter gunships were destroyed at the military airport, rebels said Wednesday in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. According to an <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, a Soviet convoy pulled out of the Afghan capital on Wednesday and headed up the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>, the only route leading to the Soviet border. The spokesman, who identified himself only as <PERSON> Hamad </PERSON>, said tanks and trucks carrying from 10 to 50 soldiers each moved through a checkpoint about two miles north of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> about 6 a.m. He said the soldiers seemed happy to be on their way home. `` They were smiling and they were smiling and waving,'' the spokesman said. About two miles farther north, Moslem rebels fighting to oust the Soviet-backed government of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> bombarded the convoy with rockets. Because of the shelling, Afghan soldiers refused to allow anyone past the checkpoint without permission from the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. The mountainous, 260-mile road has been the scene of heavy fighting between Soviet and Afghan forces and the U.S.-supported rebels based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Under a U.N.-sponsored agreement signed in April, the 115,000 Soviet troops sent into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to prop up the <LOCATION> Marixst </LOCATION> government in late 1979 are to be gone by Feb. 15. Western and Soviet diplomats estimate that only 15,000 <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers remain in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. As the withdrawal deadline approached, Soviet soldiers turned over outposts along the perimeter road around <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to the Afghan forces. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromov </PERSON>, the commander of the Soviet troops in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, said Tuesday he is confident the Afghans can hold onto the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> and the key mountain pass that has been the scene of heavy fighting. The Soviets have assured the Afghan government they will continue to provide military assistance to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> after the last Soviet soldiers return home. But the Soviets have not said when that assistance will arrive. An estimted 1,000 flatbed trucks carrying rocket launchers, ammunition and small missiles move along the highway every day, Afghan officers stationed along the road have said. The Soviets also use the highway to carry flour, eggs, kerosene, fuel and other supplies to the capital, where food and fuel shortages have been reported in recent weeks, partly due to rebel attacks on convoys moving on the highway. The emergency shipments have helped ease the long lines that formed outside bread shacks. Most lines have disappeared or become noticeably shorter. Local officias say they have at least a three-month reserve, but one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said Tuesday there was only enough to last a few days. Several diplomats and relief workers, however, dismissed the claim. `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is either very pessimistic or they think we really eat a lot,'' said one <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity. However, long lines still form outside the gasoline stations and stretch for blocks. It was unclear how long the Soviet tranport will continue to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, where refugees from the war have more than doubled the population to 2 million. Packed buses, many with people riding on top with their thin, ragged shawls flapping in the cold wind, arrive in the capital daily. Rockets are periodically fired into the capital. Two car bombs exploded this week, and two suitcase bombs were found and defused at the airport. Several missiles also have been fired at the airport and at departing planes. The Afghan soldiers who defected in southeastern <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> surrendered large quantities of arms and ammunition, according to <PERSON> Qaribur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehman </PERSON> <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group. <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON>, who runs the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said guerrillas launched combined assaults on <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> airport on Saturday, `` inflicting untold losses on the puppet troops'' and destroying two helicopter gunships. The news agency said the insurgents attacked security posts around <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> province Sunday and captured weapons, rockets and military trucks.

 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, arriving in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Administration's first overseas mission, said today that any effort by the Latin countries to form a `` debtors' cartel'' would be strongly resisted by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, speaking to reporters aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Two just before landing in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, said the idea being considered by some Latin leaders to develop a united front to deal with their common debt crisis is `` counterproductive.'' `` We are absolutely opposed to the idea of a debtors' cartel,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` Our strong position is that a debtors' cartel is a non-starter'' because each country has different circumstances that should be addressed on an individual basis. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> made the comments as he flew here to attend the inauguration Thursday of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s new president, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. Upon his arrival, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> caused a horn-honking stir at a busy intersection when he stopped his motorcade for an impromptu shopping trip at a small corner fruit market. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> ate a banana and sampled a guava and handed out pins bearing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Venezuelan flags. With some two dozen heads of state expected at the inauguration, the Third World debt drisis is expected to be a major topic of discussion among the leaders and when they meet with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in bilateral talks. Today, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s packed schedule included meetings with <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> and with the country's outgoing president, <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Lusinchi </PERSON>, and Colombian President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> indicated that he would be discouraging efforts by some of the leaders, including <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, to coordinate their tactics and demands for dealing with creditors. The vice president said he phoned former President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> for advice the night before his departure. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, as vice president in 1958, made a trip to <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> where he faced violent anti-American crowds. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said they chatted about that. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will stop in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> on his way home Friday. During meetings with political, military and labor leaders there he will stress the need to curtail human rights violations in the Central American country, officials said. He will meet with outgoing president <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and with representatives of right-wing factions, but not with anyone from the leftist party battling for power in the March 19 election, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. One official said it would be awkward for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to meet with leftist presidential candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ungo </PERSON> since he is a civilian ally of rebels fighting to overthrow the U.S.-backed government.

<HEAD>Index Up in December but Economists Still See Slower Growth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government on Wednesday reported its chief economic forecasting gauge posted a strong 0.6 percent gain in December, continuing a seesaw pattern that some analysts said portends slower growth in 1989. The Index of Leading Economic Indicators has reversed course in each of the last nine months, showing little forward momentum. December's increase left the index at 194.6 percent of its 1967 base of 100, up a slim 2 percent from the same month a year earlier. Economists welcomed the continued vacillation as a precursor to slower, more sustainable growth during the economic expansion's seventh year, saying restraint would help keep inflation in check without threatening a serious downturn `` The economy is going to be slowing down but there is no recession on the horizon,'' said economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> predicted that by the middle of next year, growth would slow enough for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to ease its tight grip on the money supply. Since March, the central bank has been pushing up interest rates to dampen inflationary pressure and slow economic growth. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahan </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Kleinwort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>., said the report's saw-toothed performance `` tells you that there is not a boom building It suggests maybe somewhat slower growth in the next couple of quarters but it most assuredly does not point to any kind of a recession.'' The economy grew a robust 3.8 percent in 1988, but the slowest quarterly performance in two years was recorded during the October-December period, when the increase in the gross national product was held to an annual rate of 2 percent. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plans to adopt his predecessor's forecast that the economy will grow at a 3.2 percent rate in 1989, but many private economists are making more pessimistic predictions for the coming year. In another economic report released Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, construction spending shot up 2.5 percent in December to end a weak year on a strong note. Construction spending for all of 1988 totaled $ 403.4 billion, up just 1.1 percent from 1987. Taking inflation into account, spending actually was down 0.4 percent. It was the slowest performance since the recession year of 1982. Economist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Annable </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> said that while the finish of 1988 was surprisingly strong, construction spending is likely to slacken this year as rising interest rates take their toll. December's increase in the leading index was bolstered by positive movement in six of the nine available components. The biggest boost came from an increase in manufacturers' orders for consumer goods. Other positive business barometers were: rising stock prices, more orders for new plants and equipment, rising prices for raw materials signaling a strong demand, increased demand for business permits and growth in the inflation-adjusted money supply. The two indicators that made a negative contribution were a shortening in the length of the average work week and an increase in weekly unemployment claims. One indicator, the time needed for companies to receive deliveries from vendors, was unchanged. While the index's recent waffling was seen by many as a sign of slower growth ahead, <PERSON> Annable </PERSON> said December's strong showing suggests `` this economy still has a lot of momentum going into the first quarter of the year.'' `` You've got all the factors in line to make this a pretty good growth year,'' he said. `` The economy is slowing, but it's not slowing down dramatically.'' The leading index, designed to show what direction the economy will head six to nine months in the future, traditionally is thought to be predicting a recession if it declines three months in a row. The index has correctly forecast all eight recessions since it was created in 1948, but also has falsely predicted recessions four times. Starting with the report for January, its components are being revised in an effort to make the index more accurately reflect future economic activity.

 Two men accused of planting a remote-control bomb that seriously injured a sheriff were hired to kill him for $ 20,000, federal authorities charged in court papers today. The complaint was made public one day after the men, one of them a former police officer, were arrested in the bombing in December that nearly ripped off <LOCATION> Lafourche </LOCATION> Parish Sheriff <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>'s foot and seriously injured a deputy. The complaint includes an affidavit based on information from an unidentified source on the suspects, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> McClendon </PERSON>, 42, of Slaughter and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tullier </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 23, of St. Amant. The document does not say who wanted <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON> killed or why. `` We feel we have a lot more work to do,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` I would just say we definitely would anticipate more arrests.'' <PERSON> McClendon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tullier </PERSON> were to appear today before a magistrate in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> for a bail hearing on bombing and conspiracy charges. According to federal agents, <PERSON> McClendon </PERSON> is a former police officer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>. He also held a Lafourche Parish Sheriff's commission and was involved with a regional drug task force there in the early 1970s. <PERSON> Tullier </PERSON> was identified as an unemployed instrument fitter. If convicted, they could get up to 25 years in prison and a $ 25,000 fine. The federal complaint said the men collected $ 8,000 and were to receive $ 12,000 more once <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON> was dead. The complaint said the bomb was a box holding two pipes, each loaded with explosives, nails and bullets. It appeared to have been detonated by a model airplane remote control device. <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>, 60, and part-time deputy <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Leche </PERSON>, 62, were injured as they left a Christmas party for senior citizens at the <ORGANIZATION> Thibodaux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON> noticed a paper bag by his car and pushed it with his left foot, authorities said. The pipe bomb inside exploded, spraying him with nails and bullets. Doctors at <ORGANIZATION> Thibodaux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON> almost died of shock and loss of blood. They reconnected his foot and predicted he will regain 90 percent use of it within a year. He was discharged from the hospital last month. Leche was released after two days in the hospital.

 Fourteen-year-old <PERSON> Staci </PERSON> <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> left for school Wednesday `` tired, angry and sad'' because she was kicked out of her parents' home in a court battle over a rule barring children from her small subdivision. `` There are no rights for the younger generation. There are no laws for young people. The Constitution is n't for us,'' <PERSON> Staci </PERSON> said bitterly over a bowl of cereal at her brother's house. `` I'm angry at my neighbors and sad because I ca n't stay with my parents.'' She said it was hard making the adjustment to her temporary new home, about six miles from the two-block-long mobile home park she was evicted from the day before because deed restrictions bar children under 15. `` It was scary waking up this morning. I did n't know where I was at first,'' <PERSON> Staci </PERSON> said. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Pasco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON> rejected <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON>'s request to delay a Jan. 6 order. He said if <PERSON> Staci </PERSON> was n't out of the house by 5 p.m. the couple would go to jail for 10 days. The judge said <PERSON> Staci </PERSON>, a quiet A-B freshman at <ORGANIZATION> Zephyrhills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, may come home for visits, even for overnight, but may not move home permanently until she turns 15 on April 7. She says she will move home then. `` We have nothing against the girl; it's the principle,'' said <PERSON> Aline </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>. She is one of the neighbors who sued to preserve the adults-only status of the tiny mobile home settlement on the back streets in this quiet retirement community. `` We bought here with the idea of peace and quiet in our old age.'' The feud began shortly after the Elmers moved into the unnamed subdivision of 17 households in fall 1987. The neighborhood, two short blocks of neatly kept homes, is composed of retirees, except for the Elmers. Mrs. <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON>, a realtor-associate, admits she knew about the age restriction before buying. But she liked the area; it was affordable and convenient to work and school. Other residents, she said, violated deed restrictions governing placement of clotheslines and propane tanks so she did n't think <PERSON> Staci </PERSON> would be a problem. She was wrong. All the neighbors hired an attorney and filed a lawsuit in May to enforce the age clause. In August, a judge upheld the deed restrictions and said <PERSON> Staci </PERSON> had to go. <PERSON> Staci </PERSON> stayed. Earlier this month <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON> said he had no choice but to find the parents in contempt. He set a deadline for them to comply or report to jail. The Elmers' attorney, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON>, made one last bid Tuesday to delay Staci's move until mid-March after amendments to a federal housing law take effect outlawing age restrictions in some communities. The judge rejected the request and scheduled a hearing for March 22. `` I knew it would happen because the neighbors do n't like me. They would have done anything to get rid of me,'' <PERSON> Staci </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, a retired law enforcement officer from <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, was satisfied with the outcome. If the deed restriction was broken, he said, it would open up the area for sale to anyone. Mrs. <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON>, whose husband is a long-distance truck driver, worries about the scars on her daughter. In fact, <PERSON> Staci </PERSON> was so upset after the ruling she had her mother stay overnight with her at her married brother <PERSON> Darwyn </PERSON>'s house. `` This is hard on <LOCATION> Staci </LOCATION> emotionally,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON>, 45. `` I ca n't believe people can be this cruel. They did n't care if she had to sleep on a park bench. `` If I had thought all this would happen, there'd been no way I would have done this to hurt <PERSON> Staci </PERSON>. But at this point, I would not sell my house. We've gone through too much.''

<HEAD>Democratic Chairman Seen as Independent, But Liberal Image Lingers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> regulars on Wednesday described incoming party chairman <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> as `` his own man,'' but there was widespread concern that his ties to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> would reinforce the party's liberal image. `` I do n't see him as <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s man,'' said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` I see him as his own man. I think most -LRB- people -RRB- see him as <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s man, but not the party leaders.'' An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey of state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders and elected officials disclosed a wide range of opinion about the impact <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s election might have on party fortunes. They spoke as the chairman-to-be prepared to head into the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> on Thursday on a trip designed to confront concerns of party leaders in a region marked by the conservative cast of its politics. Now unopposed for the party leadership post, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> will become chairman at the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Feb. 10 _ the first black to head a major political party. He emerged the victor in a five-way contest that included three former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members and the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> joined <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s presidential campaign in May 1988 and as his convention manager was <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s principal negotiator with aides to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> also played a major role in <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION>'s 1980 presidential campaign and was general counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> when <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was chairman. While many party officials said they were confident of <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s independence, doubts remained among conservative Democrats Their concerns were based not on <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s views on issues but on his ties to party liberals. `` He is <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s man,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman. But he expressed desire to work with <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. `` Nothing is as bad tomorrow as it looks today,'' he said. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, was one of the last holdouts for an alternative to <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON> said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s role as convention chairman for the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> presidential campaign should not be held against him. `` There were a lot of moderates and whites who urged him to take that job at the convention and be a moderator,'' <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON> said. `` Now I think the same people should be willing to give him a chance.'' He urged <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> to appoint a task force to address the concerns of moderates. Some legislative leaders voiced concern that <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s selection could hurt Democrats in local races _ a possibility most respondents thought unlikely. `` I do n't know <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't know anything about <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. But people I've talked to are concerned it might hurt us.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said there was a conservative trend in the country and `` a lot of people are concerned we're moving away from the national trend.'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tandler </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> businessman active in raising money for <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> candidates, said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s election `` may be a problem in that on a national level the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has managed to either paint itself or be painted into a corner that represents the interests of minorities and women and disenfranchised to the exclusion of the middle class.'' `` It's a very positive step for us to pick a black chairman,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Marino </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` That's because we do n't look at <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> as simply being black. We look upon him as someone who can unite all Democrats and put it together.'' Some of the strongest early opposition to <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> came from <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who said he would consider boycotting national party functions if <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> became chairman. He said a Brown chairmanship would be a victory for the `` ultra-liberal wing'' of the party. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, a black <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> Democratic official, countered that `` with that kind of talk -LRB- by <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> -RRB-, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> -LRB- the Republican national chairman -RRB- would not have a hard job getting blacks to join the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Mac </PERSON> <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> state senator with strong ties to organized labor, said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s election furthers the image of the Democrats as the party of blacks and liberals. `` Unfortunately, in politics, once the image is created, it's awfully difficult to change, even if the image is incorrect,'' he said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> party leader, said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> might have to take a step comparable to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s move to normalize relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, a step made easier by <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s long history as a fervent anti-communist. `` <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> comes from the liberal wing of the party and will, as the saying goes, have to go to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> like <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> did,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. `` The ball's in his court.'' Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> met with <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> last weekend and said he told <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> `` the party's goals need to be redefined. I meant that the Democrats have to help to make a free market work and be frugal in spending.'' <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> said that while there was a perception that <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> is tied to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` it will be corrected shortly.''

 Construction spending, depressed by a downturn in work on apartment buildings, rose just 1.1 percent last year, the weakest showing since the recession year of 1982, the government reported Wednesday. The year ended on a strong note, however, as construction spending rose 2.5 percent in December, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported. Spending for all of 1988 totaled $ 403.4 billion, a slim increase from $ 398.9 billion in the previous year. But after taking into account inflation, spending actually was down 0.4 percent from 1987. Construction spending had been down 5.2 percent in 1982, or 8.1 percent after adjusting for inflation. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahan </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Kleinwort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said that while construction strength increased at the end of 1988 due to strong growth in personal income, spending this year should be moderate as interest rates rise. `` If interest rates do continue rising that should act as a squeeze on overall construction spending,'' he said. `` I do n't think it's going to be a banner year.'' Last year's spending pace was depressed by slow activity on apartments, a category that suffered from high vacancy rates and was still feeling the impact of the 1986 tax overhaul that curtailed tax breaks for construction investments. In inflation-adjusted dollars, apartment construction was down 13.9 percent to $ 19.3 billion last year, while work on single-family homes rose 2.9 percent to $ 103.6 billion. Non-residential construction spending was down a slight 0.1 percent to $ 78.1 billion, while spending on government projects was down 0.4 percent to $ 65.8 billion after adjusting for inflation. High mortgage interest rates have restrained construction activity in most sectors. Fixed-rate home mortgages averaged 10.6 percent last week, up from 10.16 percent a year earlier, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Economist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Annable </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> said that while construction spending is likely to slacken later this year, the finish of 1988 was stronger than expected. `` Construction has stayed surprisingly strong, given interest rates and the upward pressure on interest rates,'' he said. `` They have n't had quite as much bite as history might have told us.'' Building activity rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 422.7 billion in December, the fourth straight monthly rise. The 2.5 percent increase was the best since a 2.8 percent rise last March. For the month, residential construction rose 0.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 220.9 billion, reflecting a 1.1 percent gain in single-family home building. Apartment construction dropped 2.3 percent. Non-residential construction rose 3.4 percent to an annual rate of $ 96.4 billion. Spending on government projects was up 7.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 86.8 billion. The monthly figures are not adjusted for inflation.

<HEAD>Movie Critic Ban May Violate Rights, Attorney General Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLYTHE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A ban by the only movie theater in town on the only movie critic in town may violate a civil rights law, the state attorney general's office says. But the office is advising the editor of <PERSON> Blythe </PERSON>'s twice-weekly <ORGANIZATION> Palo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Verde </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> to work for an amicable settlement to his dispute with the <ORGANIZATION> Blythe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cinema </ORGANIZATION>. Editor <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanford </PERSON> said Tuesday he has been advised by a deputy to Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> that the theater's ban on his movie critic is probably a violation of the state's Unruh Civil Rights Act, an interpretation disputed Wednesday by an attorney for the theater owner. <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON>'s office has n't responded to his request that the state sue the theater on behalf of the paper and its part-time movie critic, <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Monnett </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Monnett </PERSON>, who works for the price of her tickets and who refuses to review R-rated movies, was banned from the theater Dec. 14. Managers said her negative reviews were hurting business, but she has responded that most of her comments have been positive. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashby </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON>, confirmed the office had been asked to pursue the case, but indicated the <ORGANIZATION> Van </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kamp </ORGANIZATION> would prefer to see the parties settle their differences amicably. `` We told him that the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ... held that the Unruh Act can be broadly interpreted to prohibit all unreasonable discrimination by private businesses,'' <PERSON> Ashby </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, brother of theater owner <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, said he disagreed that the ban on the critic violates the state civil rights law, because courts have ruled the law applies to arbitrary discrimination against classes of people. `` If we eliminated all film critics by class, or all children, or all women, that would be class discrimination and that would be arbitrary,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` Those same court rulings say you can eject somebody from your establishment that's injurious to your business.'' Since the ban, <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> has been sending Mrs. <PERSON> Monnett </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Yuma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, a round trip of more than 100 miles, to review movies that will be shown in <LOCATION> Blythe </LOCATION>, a desert town along on the <LOCATION> California-Arizona </LOCATION> border. Theater officials said they offered to let Mrs. <PERSON> Monnett </PERSON> return if the newspaper would run reviews by a theater-hired critic next to her reviews. <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> rejected that offer, saying the other critic would be `` P.R. hype in our newspaper.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> accused the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Wednesday of continuing widespread bombing attacks inside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, charging that `` unprecedented destruction'' has occurred as Soviet troops withdraw. Department spokeswoman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> renewed accusations made repeatedly in recent weeks against the Soviet raids, contending that the number of sorties `` continues to be very high. ... It's in a lot of parts of the country'' and included high-altitude bombing runs, artillery and missile attacks. The spokesman did say, however, that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> welcomed the pledge by the top Soviet general in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromov </PERSON>, that once the pullout is completed by the Feb. 15 deadline, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will halt the bombing raids. `` Those kind of assurances are welcome and we expect <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to live up to this public commitment,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. On Monday, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> charged the Soviets with conducting a `` scorched earth'' campaign as their military forces depart, an assertion that <PERSON> Gromov </PERSON> denied. While <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said he had no way of quantifying the casualty rates, he said `` hundreds of civilians'' had been killed during the bombing raids. And when asked whether he knew if Afghan guerrillas were present in the areas targeted by the Soviets, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> did not answer directly. The spokesman said that besides the bombardment directed in the area of the departure route, there has been `` mass destruction of villages'' along the highway that links <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> with the Soviet border and villages some distance from the highway. The highway is the only land route home for <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Krelim </LOCATION> has complained that withdrawing Soviet troops have been attacked by the U.S.-armed rebel forces. `` The salient facts today are massive Soviet bombardment of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and, secondly, massive stockpiling of Soviet equipment in the hands of the Afghan regime,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. `` The fact of the matter is intensive, unprecedented destruction in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> repeated once again that that <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> considers the bombing raids to be in violation of the assurances provided by the Soviets last year in connection with the agreement signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> outlining the Soviet withdrawal. `` To see here, in the last weeks, this just massive effort aimed at destroying even more of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and without question killing Afghans _ it just does n't seem to be what ought to be a policy followed by anyone at this stage of the game,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Authorities eased a curfew here Wednesday, but ethnic tensions remain high in this republic that was the site of mass demonstrations before being hit by a devastating earthquake in December. The military commander in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, in an announcement published in the daily newspaper <PERSON> Kommunist </PERSON>, said the midnight-to-6 a.m. curfew would be reduced further to 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. The decision was made `` considering the stabilization of the situation in the capital and regions of the republic during the past month, the participation of citizens in supporting public order and requests of residents,'' the newspaper said. A government commission called for speeding up construction to clear the debris and build new housing in northwestern regions of the republic stricken by the Dec. 7 earthquake, which killed an estimated 25,000 people and left a half million homeless. The commission complained the organizations involved in reconstruction are bickering among themselves and making little progress. Also on Wednesday, the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> visited Armenian leaders in a tour he said would help him determine what further aid can be provided. The curfew in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> was imposed in November after at least 30 people were killed in ethnic rioting in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and the neighboring republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. The streets of the Armenian capital, which a few weeks ago were dotted with tanks, armored personal carriers and <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> troops, were comparatively demilitarized this week. Only a handful of soldiers and one armored personnel carrier were visible on Opera Square, the site of street protests last year. In the most recent violence, the square was surrounded by troops and military vehicles. On Lenin Square, there were no tanks, although six armored personel carriers and a handful of troops were deployed at main government buildings. Armenian refugees from the violence in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> gathered Wednesday, as they have for several weeks, outside the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> offices to discuss their fate. Soviet authorities say about 300,000 people _ Armenians who were living in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and Azerbaijanis from <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> _ have fled to their ancestral republics. Since February 1988, residents of the predominantly Armenian region of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> have been agitating to be made part of the republic of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Armenians are predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>, while Azerbaijanis are predominantly Moslem. People in a crowd of about 100 refugees said the government is refusing to give them jobs or homes. They said they were afraid their lives would be in danger if they returned to <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. `` I consider that it's better to die here in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> than to try to live there,'' said <PERSON> Gena </PERSON> <PERSON> Agabekyan </PERSON>, an ethnic Armenian who fled the <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> two months ago. Agabekyan, who fled along with his teen-age son, daughter, mother and wife, said the government had given him the equivalent of $ 160 for each member of his family, but what he really wanted was a job. He said he had worked in <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> as a crane operator for the <ORGANIZATION> Azerbaijan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> but was fired eight months ago. `` Because I am an Armenian, no reason was given,'' said <PERSON> Agabekyan </PERSON>, 50. Authorities have been trying to persuade the refugees to return to their homes, but have met with only limited success. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Khodzhamiryan </PERSON>, a deputy premier of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, told Soviet and foreign journalists the government was not forcing any of the refugees to return. `` If they want to return, normal conditions are created for them there,'' he said. But he acknowledged authorities were having trouble finding places for the refugees to live because most vacant apartments were turned over to those left homeless by the earthquake. Neither police nor the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s security forces interfered with the refugees, who gathered to discuss their cases. The crowd was peaceful with none of the shouting or banner waving that characterized the mass protests of recent months.

 Racial slurs and obscenities spray-painted on two buildings and a fence at the Lincoln Home National Historic Site have been removed, officials said Wednesday. `` It's all been cleaned up. ... Right after we discovered it we began cleanup,'' said acting site superintendent <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>. Damage was estimated at $ 500. <PERSON> Pink </PERSON> and blue fluorescent paint was sprayed Monday or early Tuesday on the carriage house behind <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s home, an adjacent shed and a white wooden fence behind the shed. Meters and an air conditioner also were damaged. Vandalism at the site is not common, <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> said. `` Usually it's fairly uncommon because the <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> community has a great deal of respect for the <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> sites as a whole, so we do n't really have a lot of problems with vandalism,'' he said. Because the damage occurred on federal property, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was investigating, <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> said. No arrests had been made. The <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> home, the only house the nation's 16th president ever owned, was reopened last year after a multimillion-dollar renovation.

<HEAD>Pentagon Says U.S. Decides to Reduce Scale of Exercises</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has decided to reduce the scale of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s Reforger exercises in what one defense official called an attempt `` to lower the heat of political debate in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.'' Defense officials, who insisted on anonymity, said the changes would allow the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies to reduce the impact of field training on the West German public. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced its plans to change Reforger exercises in a statement Wednesday while denying they were tied in any way to politics. Indeed, the Pentagon's press release portrayed the modifications as an `` enhancement'' that would allow <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops to `` train smarter.'' Pentagon sources said, however, the goal of `` training smarter'' would be reached by reducing the number of troops moved from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for field maneuvers; reducing the scope of exercise maneuvers by all troops, including those posted to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> full time, and relying to a greater extent on computer simulations to train battle staffs. `` They can call this an enhancement if they want, but we're also trying to lower the heat of political debate in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' said one official, referring to growing complaints there about low-level military flight training and plans to modernize nuclear missiles. `` We ca n't afford to lose public opinion to -LRB- Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his PR campaign,'' said another source, citing announcements by the Soviet leader of unilateral troop cuts. `` If we can accomplish our major training aims and lessen the impact of our training on the populace, then we should do that. And if we can save some money, given the budget environment back here and concerns about sharing <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> burdens, so much the better,'' the source said. In December, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> announced at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would unilaterally cut its military forces by a half-million troops and reduce its conventional arms substantially. The Reforger -LRB- Return of Forces to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- exercises have long been a mainstay of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> as well as <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> deterrent policy. They normally consist of the large-scale movement of Army troops from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, simulating the type of reinforcement operation that would be needed to sustain Western forces in the event of a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact attack. Last year's Reforger, conducted in the late summer and early fall, involved the deployment of about 17,000 soldiers to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Once they arrived, ground and aerial maneuvers were conducted in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> with a total 97,700 American and allied troops. On Wednesday, the Pentagon announced that <PERSON> Reforger </PERSON> 89, set for September, had been canceled and would be merged with Reforger 90, which has now been scheduled for January to March 1990. In place of Reforger 89, the allies now intend to stage a smaller exercise dubbed Caravan Guard `` to test the improved training techniques planned for Reforger 90,'' the Pentagon said. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> refused to say how many soldiers would cross the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> for Reforger 90. It did say, however, the field manuever portion of the exercise would involve about 75,000 allied troops total _ or more than 20,000 fewer than last year. `` In a move designed to enable the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to ` train smarter' and ultimately improve combat readiness, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> has announced a major enhancement to the Reforger exercise program,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said in its statement. `` The Reforger enhancement program will allow <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces to obtain the maximum training value from major exercises by integrating new computer simulation technology, command post exercises and field training exercises.'' Cmdr. <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sundin </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> was convinced that computer technology `` can be used to realistically simulate a wide range of operational and logistical functions normally carried out by soldiers in the field.'' `` When properly integrated, these simulations will force commanders and their staffs to make real-time decisions just as if they were issuing orders to deployed units,'' he said.

<HEAD>Court Asked to Delay Detroit Newspapers' Partial Merger</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Opponents of the partial merger of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> asked a federal appeals court Wednesday to delay the business deal until a legal battle over the agreement is resolved. The motion, filed by <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Citizens for an <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of newspaper advertisers and readers, sought to halt the newspapers' plan to proceed with the merger on Feb. 6. The group is asking the full 13-member <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> to hear arguments for rejecting the proposed merger. The motion said implementing the agreement would `` result in the elimination of approximately 500 jobs, the publication of a single paper on weekends, increased circulation prices and probably higher advertising prices as well.'' The newspapers would suffer `` comparatively little harm'' should the agreement be delayed, the motion said. <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, owner of the News, disputed the contention that the newspapers would suffer little harm from further delay. A spokesman for the newspaper group, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, said in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> that the delay is `` costing something in the range of $ 50,000 a day.'' `` That turns into a lot of money in a hurry,'' <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> said. The News' publisher, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Weil </PERSON>, said in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, `` Financially, neither paper is making money right now. For that exact reason we want to move forward, because all of this has gone on long enough. `` But even more importantly, in terms of the employees, it's time to bring this to a conclusion. That's why we're moving forward,'' <PERSON> Weil </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, declined comment from its <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, headquarters Free Press Publisher <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said, `` In fact, the great harm continues. Not only the harm in terms of thousands of dollars that are lost each day, but the harm in the uncertainty which has clouded this newspaper's future for almost three years now.'' `` People here are entitled to know that their jobs are safe, that their newspaper can go ahead. Readers of the newspaper are entitled to know their paper has a future.'' Under the proposed 100-year agreement, the News and <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> would combine business and production operations, while maintaining separate news and editorial departments. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> initially would take 55 percent of the joint operations' profits or losses After six years, the split would be 50-50 between <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> has said it will close the Free Press without a joint operating agreement. An three-judge appeals court panel, splitting 2-to-1, on Friday rejected opponents' arguments that then-Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> had gone beyond the intent of the law in approving the joint operating agreement, an exemption from federal anti-trust laws allowed when one of the newspapers is in danger of financial failure.

<HEAD>2,500 Military Personnel in Nationwide Special Operations Exercise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 2,500 <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> personnel are invading national forests and military bases as part of a joint exercise designed to improve coordination between branches of the armed services. The six-week training exercise, dubbed <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bite </ORGANIZATION>, began Jan. 9 at seven sites in six states to give troops a taste of different terrains and climates. It ends Feb. 17. The exercise helps improve interservice coordination right down to combat uniforms worn by commanders at this Army post where the exercise is headquartered, said <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. `` If you were to walk in right now you would be hard pressed to tell who is an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> guy and who is an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> guy,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, who is deputy director of the exercise. <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bite </ORGANIZATION> is the largest nationwide exercise conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s join special forces command since it was created nearly two years ago. The reason for establishment of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, based at <ORGANIZATION> MacDill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, was to improve coordination among special forces in the various services such as the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Berets </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s SEALs. `` If you go back some years ago, perhaps all the services were guilty of not having enough joint training,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. Poor coordination of special operations became the targe of congressional criticism after a hostage-rescue mission to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in 1980 ended in disaster. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> helicopter and an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> cargo plane collided at a desert staging area, killing eight servicemen. One important aspect of training side-by-side is that members of the different service branches learn to understand each other's jargon and acronyms that are so popular in the military, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said Unlike conventional military exercises, <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bite </ORGANIZATION> is primarily conducted at night and with small units to simulate the unique missions of special operations, including fast deployment over long distances and infiltrating enemy lines. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said the exercise has been going well except for some severe winter weather in northern states. A deployment to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s upper peninsula was delayed and troops were withdrawn from the field in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> `` We did n't see, for a peacetime exercise, leaving the people out there,'' he said, although they were equipped to survive the harsh weather. The training sites are <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chaffee </LOCATION>, Ark.; <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Helena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mont </PERSON>.; <ORGANIZATION> Ocala </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>,, <ORGANIZATION> Hiawatha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Cherry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Corps </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, where a battalion of Marines is playing the role of an aggressor force.

<HEAD>Leading Paper Blasts Banquets, Says Parties in West Better</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A newspaper Wednesday criticized <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s `` stupid habit of banquets,'' saying they waste money and do n't compare to parties in the West. The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> officials eat, drink and waste too much during their ubiquitous feasts, impoverishing the country's coffers and threatening the health of the revelers. The state-run press is engaged in a campaign to illuminate social problems resulting from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economic reforms, designed to open <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to the West. A recent article on liquor in the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, called the Chinese spirit, maotai, an `` all-purpose grease'' for bribing officials. Another report in the Peasant's Daily told a short story about a young woman who became a prostitute because she loved money. Sunday marks the start of the Spring Festival, the lunar new year and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s biggest holiday. Families, enterprises and ministries regularly hold banquets during the holidays, consuming large amounts of food and drink. `` In the weeks before and after the Spring Festival, who knows how much food will be waisted and how many people will get sick because of overindulgence,'' the article said. The main reason for overindulgence, the article said, was that <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people are not educated enough. `` As soon as a stupid person gets a little money ... the first thing he thinks about is a banquet, eating and drinking,'' said the article, titled `` Get Rid of the Stupid Habit of Banquets.'' `` Over time, this foolishness has become a custom that wo n't be changed easily.'' `` The poorer you are the bigger the banquet,'' the story said, pointing to weddings. `` A couple with an elementary school education will fill 20 tables for their wedding banquet, those with a high school education will reserve five, a couple who has graduated from college will handle two tables and those with a doctorate wo n't even fill one,'' it said. Another problem is that too many dishes are served. `` We treat our guests as if they're starving to death,'' the article said. `` First they're eight cold dishes, then eight hot dishes, then a whole chicken, then a whole duck, then a giant carp, then a hot pot, then dessert and fruit.'' By the time the feast is over, about two-thirds of the food remains. Alcohol was cited as another problem. `` Revelers wo n't rest until they make the guests drunk.'' It said. `` The result is that both guest and host get plastered. The lighter ones talk nonsense, the heavier ones end up getting sick on the floor, going home and suffering the curses of their wives or parents.'' The story called on Chinese revelers to study parties in the West. `` Parties in the West are worth copying in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' it said. `` A host puts some dishes on a table and lets the guest pick and choose as they please ... Such a method is very convenient.''

<TEXT>
 Actress-singer <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> and estranged husband <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> have agreed on a division of property and filed a petition for divorce, court records show. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> petition to dissolve the stormy three-year marriage cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split, and seeks restoration of the singer's former name, <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciccone </PERSON>. It also said community property and financial obligations shared by the couple `` have been disposed of by written agreement.'' No details were disclosed in the two-page petition filed Jan. 25. <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> publicist <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> said last week that <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> would get the couple's <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION> home and the singer would keep the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> apartment. <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> bought a $ 2.9 million <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> home earlier this month. <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION>'s attorney, <PERSON> Marcy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenblum </PERSON>, declined to comment, and publicist <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> did n't return telephone calls Wednesday. It is the second time the sultry songstress has taken steps to end her 1985 marriage to <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION>. She first filed a Superior Court divorce petition in 1987, but later withdrew it. The latest divorce action follows a Dec. 28 incident in which <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> deputies were called to the couple's <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION> home after the hot-tempered <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> allegedly beat <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>. No charges were filed. <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> rose to fame with her hits `` Borderline'' and `` Like a Virgin,'' and is perhaps best known by the title of another song, `` Material Girl.'' She starred in the movies `` Desperately Seeking Susan'' and `` <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> Surprise,'' a box office dud co-starring <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> rose to stardom in the movie `` Fast Times at Ridgemont High'' and went on to appear in `` Taps,'' `` The Falcon and the Snowman'' and `` Colors.'' <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> served more than half of a 60-day jail term in 1987 for violating parole by punching a movie extra during filming of the movie `` Colors.'' He was on probation at the time for punching a man he accused of trying to kiss <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> in a nightclub in April 1986.

<HEAD>Constitutional Amendment Introduced on Campaign Spending Limits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A handful of senators complaining about how much time is spent on raising campaign money said Wednesday they want a constitutional amendment to let <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> set limits on the costs of running for office. `` Public office all too often goes to the highest bidder, the highest spender,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., whose 1986 re-election campaign was among the most expensive in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history The constitutional amendment was introduced by Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, and backed by <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> and six other senators. It would allow <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and state governments to `` set reasonable limits on campaign expenditures.'' <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, who backed a similar amendment in the last <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said the amendment was needed because of a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision striking down attempts to limit campaign spending, saying it would infringe on rights of free speech. `` If you're rich, you have freedom of speech,'' <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> said. `` If you're poor, you have the freedom to shut up.'' If the amendment were passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and ratified by the state legislatures, <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> said the laws actually imposing the limits would then be drafted. He said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would need to go to work to eliminate practices of raising `` soft money'' _ funds gathered by political parties for presidential campaigns _ and `` bundling,'' a mechanism that allows the parties to bypass spending limits on congressional campaigns. Coincidentally, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday announced that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay a $ 20,000 fine for its handling of a 1986 fund-raising campaign for a dozen <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidates to which then-Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lent his support. The commission found that the committee, set up by the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to assist in electing <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senatorial candidates, violated federal election law because it did not charge the candidates for the cost of the fund-raising effort. However, the six-member commission deadlocked over a related question of whether the senatorial committee broke the law by the way it funneled more than $ 2.7 million in campaign contributions to the 12 candidates. Republican <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidates in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> were on the receiving end of the funnel. The commission's decision, which was reached last year but was not released until Wednesday, dealt with bundling, a tactic used by political committees to gather funds from individual contributors and then channel the money to a particular candidate specified by the donor. The practice allows organizations to bypass provisions in the law setting limits on how much money they can give a candidate. Under the law, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> can give no more than a total of $ 17,500 to a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidate. The elections laws permit political organizations to act as a conduit for contributions to candidates as long as the organization does not exert enough control over the money to channel the cash to whomever it chooses. One fund-raising letter sent out by the committee and signed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked for contributions for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidates in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s letter warned that if the four Republicans in those states `` do n't raise at least $ 236,500 in the next 21 days _ they'll lose.'' `` It's that simple _ and that frightening,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wrote in the Sept. 2, 1986, letter. `` That's why I'm counting on you to rush me your check for $ 25 by return mail today.'' All four of those candidates ended up losing. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Noble </PERSON>, the general counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION>, argued that the Republican committee's fund-raising program `` was carefully designed to channel receipts in ways determined by -LRB- the committee -RRB- itself.'' <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerson </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> in the case, said the donor, not the committee, is in control of the funds. `` After all, they write the checks, the party committee does not,'' <PERSON> Gerson </PERSON> said. `` Once the donor gives, the committee has no choice but to forward that to the candidate within the appropriate period of time.'' While the commission failed to support Noble's argument on that point, it did find that the Republican committee should have declared that the $ 608,568 cost of its fund-raising effort should have been counted itself as a contribution to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidates' campaigns

<TEXT>
 A contractor doing preliminary repair work on a highway bridge discovered an 18-inch hole in the deck Wednesday, forcing state transportation officials to close two of three lanes while emergency repairs were made. `` You can see all the way through the deck,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Keish </PERSON>, a state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The Interstate 95 bridge over the <LOCATION> Rippowam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION> and is three miles from the <LOCATION> Mianus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> bridge in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, which collapsed in June 1983, killing three people. <PERSON> Keish </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Rippowam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> bridge was sound and the 18-inch hole posed no danger to motorists. The bridge lanes closed around 9 a.m., and was to reopen with an emergency patch in place by the afternoon rush hour, <PERSON> Keish </PERSON> said. The discovery did not affect morning rush hour, but by 1 p.m., traffic was backed up three to four miles, state police said. The repairs involved ripping up a 4-by-6 foot patch of pavement and replacing it with a quick-drying patch, <PERSON> Keish </PERSON> said. The entire bridge deck is to be replaced as part of work to be completed by June 1991, he said. Collapse of the <LOCATION> Mianus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> bridge in 1983 prompted the state to begin a multibillion-dollar, 10-year road and bridge repair program. A Superior Court jury decided three years ago that inadequate maintenance led to the bridge collapse. <PERSON> Keish </PERSON> said there was no comparison between the two bridge problems. `` You had a 100-foot section fall out of a bridge, completely disappear,'' he said of the <LOCATION> Mianus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> bridge. `` Here you've got an 18-inch hole. Our major concern was the traffic, not the hole.''

 The navy said Wednesday the sinking of one of its supply ships in the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> did not result in a major oil spill or an ecological disaster in the pristine environment. Some environmentalists said the accident left a 10-mile oil slick and that wildlife was already dying. Others said it was too early to say how much oil spilled and how much damage was done to the region and its animals. `` There could be a small stain'' from the release of oil in the engine room of the <LOCATION> Bahia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paraiso </LOCATION>, a navy spokesman said. `` Anything else, no.'' The vessel, which carried tourists as well as fuel for several polar stations, hit a rock Saturday, was evacuated and listed for three days before sinking in high winds and heavy seas late Tuesday night. No one was injured. The incident occurred in the <LOCATION> Bismarck </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> 600 miles south of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION> on the tip of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and within two miles of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>, where the ship's 300 tourists and crew initially were taken. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> said the vessel carried 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel and that an `` incurable disaster'' would result if all the fuel leaked into the unspoiled waters in the region. A spokesman at the research station who requested anonymity said in a telephone interview that leaking oil had caused a 10-mile slick. Officials at the foundation, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> base and <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> said leaking fuel already has killed some krill, a shrimp-like crustacean that is the main food of the baleen whale and a vital part of the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> food chain. `` The ship rolled over, is lying on its side almost fully below the water,'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkniss </PERSON>, director of the foundation's Antarctic program, told <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s Good Morning America on Wednesday. `` This is a very enclosed area. It's a bay ... bounded by a glacier and some islands and our -LRB- research -RRB- station. So if the oil goes into the area then it will have an effect on the shoreline, on the ice, on the animals, the organisms, on the sediments,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. The depth of the water was not known. Neverthess, it remained unclear Wednesday how much oil had spilled, and the extent of any ecological damage. `` The situation is totally controlled and there is no danger of any type of release of fuel,'' said the navy spokesman, who demanded anonymity. On Tuesday, the government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Telam </ORGANIZATION> said the fuel the ship carried was contained in individual steel drums. The news agency quoted a <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION> source as saying `` a spill is practically impossible.'' <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Figari </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> expert in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> for the environmental organization <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday: `` We need time to confirm whether any oil spilled. News reports said krill were killed. I'm not sure of that. It looks like the ship sank in the bay and krill live in the open sea. There would n't have been a lot of krill there.'' Asked to comment, a spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> said, `` We're concerned about the potential of an oil spill, but to the best of our knowlege so far there is n't one.'' Reports the <ORGANIZATION> Bahia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paraiso </ORGANIZATION> carried 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel appear to be a `` drastic exaggeration,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Bahia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paraiso </LOCATION>, launched in 1980, is a navy vessel that for three years has chartered excurision voyages as a way to defray expenses.

<TEXT>
 A decision to hold a key <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting 10 days earlier than planned fueled speculation Wednesday about a split in the ruling communist elite over political reforms and unpopular price increases. In a terse announcement after its regular weekly session Tuesday, the party's Politburo announced the 108-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will meet Feb. 10 to decide `` topical political questions.'' News that the meeting would take place earlier than the scheduled Feb. 20 date followed a statement from party leader <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> that differences among the 11 Politburo members are slowing reform. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> must decide whether or not it wants to make leadership changes. He and Premier <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> also made clear in separate statements that they disagree with fellow Politburo member <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> over the leading reformer's startling weekend statement that the 1956 anti-Soviet revolt was a popular uprising. Only the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> can deliver the final verdict on this matter, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said, adding that he has seen no new documents backing <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>'s view against the official version that the revolt, quashed by Soviet troops invited by Hungarian leaders, was a counterrevolution. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> also said leadership differences are impeding unpopular austerity measures and are unsettling Western bankers concerned about <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s timely repayment on its $ 17 billion foreign debt. Two waves of price increases on most consumer staples in January have prompted strikes and unprecedented protests from the official trade union organization, which has called for talks with the government. Official statistics in January showed one in five of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s 10.6 million citizens already is living below the poverty line Inflation _ estimated at 12-15 percent by the government and 20-25 percent by economists _ will cut further into Hungarians' living standards this year Hungarian observers and West and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc diplomats noted Wednesday that while recent political reforms have drawn praise abroad, they have failed to lift the mood at home. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> recently legalized independent movements and demonstrations. Some Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they saw <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>'s statement as no more than an attempt to unify the leadership behind reforms. Others, however, noted the statement implied criticism of both <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> and chief party ideologist <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Berecz </PERSON>, who last weekend suggested the party was not quite capable of `` directing the processes'' in Hungarian politics. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s increasingly candid state media had no independent comment Wednesday. But they did print long summaries of Western press comment, highlighting foreign speculation that recent events may presage leadership changes.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has again deluged librarians looking for a few income tax forms with crates of thousands of forms they do n't need, do n't want and ca n't use. `` The Bible says ` Ask and you shall receive.' But this is ridiculous and from the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> of all things,'' Library Director <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarisch </PERSON> said Wednesday as another carton of tax forms arrived. The library already had cartons containing about 10,000 supplemental schedules. <PERSON> Jarisch </PERSON> said she found about 100 of the 1040 forms she had sought in the box. She originally requested about 1,000 each of the most commonly used forms, plus instruction booklets, figuring that would be sufficient for this <LOCATION> Berkshire </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> city of 16,000 people. `` It was just a quirk,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruttenberg </PERSON>, a spokesman for the regional <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, suggesting the problem was the person taking the telephone order misheard the request. Last year, the boxes kept coming until the library had 48,625 forms, instead of the assortment of 5,000 she had ordered. And in 1987, about 24,000 forms were received in response to a similar request, she said. `` The children's librarian is already planning origami -LRB- Oriental paper folding -RRB- classes, and the <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> may name me the ` Woman of the Year' for my regular contributions to the recycling program,'' <PERSON> Jarisch </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Editor Says Gorbachev Makes Much More Than Typical Soviet Worker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> earns $ 28,800 a year, about seven times the pay of a typical Soviet worker, the editor of a muckraking <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> weekly said Wednesday. <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON>, editor of the magazine <ORGANIZATION> Ogonyok </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that with his salary, the Soviet leader can afford to keep his wife dressed in stylish clothes. Despite glasnost, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of greater openness that has permitted magazines such as <LOCATION> Ogonyok </LOCATION> to flourish, the salaries, perquisites and personal lives of Soviet leaders are not discussed in its media. <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON> said in a telephone interview he had mentioned the salary figure and <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s wardrobe in an informal talk to student activists in <LOCATION> Komsomol </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, and his remarks were published in a youth newspaper in the republic of <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON>, who is generally viewed as a supporter and beneficiary of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, said he was neither criticizing nor defending <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in his talk. He said one of the students asked what he thought about Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> wearing fancy clothes and he replied that on the president's salary of more than 1,500 rubles a month, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> can afford to buy her new dresses sometimes. That equals $ 2,400 a month at the official rate of exchange. Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s clothes, quite fashionable by Soviet standards and often mentioned during her trips abroad, are the subject of considerable grumbling among Soviet women who are n't accustomed to their leaders' wives appearing in public and who suffer from a chronic lack of food and consumer goods. Although <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reported salary far exceeds the average wage of about $ 350 a month, it could n't begin to pay for the many privileges afforded the top Soviet leadership. Members of the elite have limousines, special food packages, access to special stores, summer homes, special schools and camps for their children and other perquisites that set them apart from typical citizens. While ordinary Soviets wait in long lines for items such as coffee, detergent, fruit, vegetables and chocolate, the elite can have such things delivered or pick them up at stores that are off-limits to average citizens. Kremlin leaders and their families also are assigned apartments that are deluxe and spacious by Soviet standards. Such privileges occasionally have been challenged, most recently at the national <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference in July by <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, the ousted <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss who was entitled to them as a member of the ruling Politburo. In an address to the conference, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, who still retains some popular support despite losing his influential posts, called for abolition of special privileges for the elite. `` If there are some shortages in our socialist society, then everybody should share the same shortage,'' he said. `` We must do away with elitism, eliminate the word ` spets' -LRB- special -RRB- from our vocabulary.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> later said in a televised discussion with conference delegates that `` we should take a look'' at party privileges because there are so many popular complaints about them.

<HEAD>Soviets Seeking Western Financial Support</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is postponing hard economic choices at home while seeking to finance reforms through loans from the West, says the author of a new book on the Soviet economy. Author <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON> joins a chorus of skeptics, including many on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, who are urging the new <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to forge a coherent policy in the West to review the strategic implications of lending to the Soviet bloc. <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON>'s new book, `` The Coming Soviet Crash: <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s Desperate Pursuit of Credit in Western Financial Markets,'' concludes that Soviet accountants have been fudging the country's economic figures for years, steadily reporting budget surpluses when there were actually growing The Soviets finally admitted to a budget deficit last October, although one respected Soviet economist has said the deficit is three times higher than the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> acknowledged. The issue has aroused concern among members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, including Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, who has cautioned that giving the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> easy credits could undercut <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests and harm, rather than help, the reforms of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The West has been slow to respond, wrote <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s onslaught of financial maneuvers seems to have left the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> dazed. Under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has turned increasingly to the West for financing, increasing commercial borrowing by half and securing lines of guaranteed credit from Western governments worth $ 7 billion, she said. As part of the reforms, the Soviets are publishing many previously secret economic statistics, although <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON> and others question the data. Last August, in a prospectus for its first foreign bond issue, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> government said it had a budget surplus, putting the figure at 3 billion rubles, or $ 1.8 billion. `` It was revealed three months later that the Soviets had been running a deficit for years,'' <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON> said. The revelation, she said, did not prompt a protest from the Swiss bank that sponsored the loan or from those who bought the issue. <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON> said the continued cloudiness of Soviet financial figures does not augur well for the West as the Soviets seek to join such Western financial institutions as the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, which require reporting in which no numbers are hidden. Although the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has increased its international borrowing, the credits do not come close to covering the deficit, and the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has simply printed more money to cover the gap, she wrote. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has backed away from one of the toughest political decisions facing him, and has maintained subsidies and controls for prices of key commoditities, <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON> said in a <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> presentation this week. For the West, the greatest concern is that the Soviets are borrowing money abroad while postponing tough political decisions at home. `` The correlation between <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reign in the Kremlin and the escalation of Soviet borrowing activities in Western financial markets is striking,'' wrote <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON>, a researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> Hoover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Within two years after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took power in March 1985, Soviet debt to the West shot up from about $ 25 billion to over $ 37 billion, an increase of 50 percent,'' she wrote. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, in a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> column on Jan. 6, cautioned that `` the notion that Western governments can help Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> through cheap credit is ... flawed.'' `` Reform means making tough choices _ butter not weapons, efficiency not useless output, consumption not forced saving. The real reformers know this. They also know it means higher prices, less job security and harder work today in exchange for the promise of a better life tomorrow,'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said. Continuing shortages of basic goods and revelations about the Soviet budget deficit have tempered optimism about that better life. Soviet Finance Minister <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gostev </PERSON> last October estimated the budget deficit at 35 billion rubles, about $ 58 billion at current exchange rates. Another well-known Soviet economist, <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON>, last week said that the actual deficit was nearly three times <PERSON> Gostev </PERSON>'s estimate, about $ 165 billion, or 11 percent of the gross national product By comparison, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government deficit runs at about 4 percent of GNP. Other Soviet officials have been more optimistic. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Korolev </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>, wrote in Pravda on Monday that the GNP grew 5 percent last year and was 13.3 percent higher than in 1985. The government announced this month that Soviet GNP in 1988 totaled 866 billion rubles, or $ 1.4 trillion. That was less than half of the 1985 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GNP </ORGANIZATION> of $ 3.8 trillion.

<DATELINE>GWINN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A bitter wind whipped the flags at half staff Wednesday as people at K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base mourned the deaths of 17 colleagues. `` That's eerie, to see that flag,'' said an airman at the northern <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> installation. `` It's even worse to see the families -LRB- of the victims -RRB- coming in.'' A military refueling plane that left <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> on Monday crashed and exploded Tuesday as it tried to take off from <ORGANIZATION> Dyess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. All 19 aboard died. It was the third fiery crash since October involving planes originating from <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, one of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s northern tier posts by <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're dealing with a base that has gone through three tragedies in four months,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bicking </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> spokesman. `` I've heard different comments, such as trouble comes in threes and now that we've had our three, we've had our trouble for awhile.'' The 26-year-old KC-135 tanker that crashed in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> on Tuesday carried 17 people from the <LOCATION> Sawyer </LOCATION> area, along with two passengers who boarded at <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION>. The plane was to escort and refuel four F-16 jets from <ORGANIZATION> Carswell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and land at <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> before reaching its principal destination, <ORGANIZATION> Andersen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bicking </PERSON> said. Seven of the dead were members of the plane's flight and maintenance crews from <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials said the rest included four civilian relatives of military personnel and four military retirees who were taking advantage of the military's policy of allowing them to hop overseas flights when there is space on board. `` It's another plane crash,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Marquette </ORGANIZATION> resident <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, sipping coffee at a local diner. `` It seems like they happen every day now.'' <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> continued routine operations Wednesday, but the close-knit base closed ranks and effectively shut out outsiders. `` Our family is going through the process of mourning. We're caring for our people,'' said the base wing commander, Col. <PERSON> Eldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Joersz </PERSON>, in a very terse meeting with the press He walked out without answering questions. `` They're pretty devastated. We want to regroup,'' said another base spokesman, Sgt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Butera </PERSON>. Memorial services at the base chapel were planned for Friday. The tension contrasted with the fortunate feeling at <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> following the Dec. 6 explosion of a B-52 bomber as it went through a touch-and-go landing on the base's main runway. All eight crew members survived in what base personnel called a miracle. Three months earlier, 10 <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> personnel had survived the Oct. 11 crash of a KC-135 that killed six people from a sister <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> base.

 Two Panamanian officials said they were struck and threatened with a pistol by two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military policemen near the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokesman denied the charges but said there was pushing and shoving between the Panamanians and the Americans. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Tejada </PERSON>, officials with the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference on Tuesday they were victims of `` brutal aggression'' by two military police officers stationed with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Southern Command.

<HEAD>Overhaul of U.S. Foreign Aid Program is Proposed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A congresional task force on Wednesday proposed a radical revamping of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign aid program, saying the current system has become too diluted, haphazard and bureaucratized to meet its goals. Since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> entered the foreign aid arena with the Marshall Plan for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> after World War II, the program has grown more complex, global realities have changed and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has lost its position as the world's most charitable nation, said the report to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign assistance needs a new premise, a new framework and a new purpose to meet the challenges of today,'' said the report, presented to committee members in a closed-door meeting. `` It is time to start anew.'' The task force, led by Reps. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., and <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, recommended repeal of the basic foreign aid law passed 28 years ago, which it said has grown cumbersome and inconsistent It called instead for a new `` International Economic Cooperation Act of 1989'' which would more narrowly define the goals of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to other countries and aim American help at encouraging broad-based economic growth in Third World countries and alleviating poverty while encouraging political freedom and environmental protection. The recommendations would sharply curb the use of `` earmarks,'' the instructions by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> spelling out precisely which countries and programs are to receive money, and how much. The practice has grown to the point where nearly all military and economic aid money is earmarked, and half of development funds, leaving little flexibility to those who administer the programs. <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzocco </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Population </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crisis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said her group's population control activities were typical of the kinds of programs that are politically vulnerable and could suffer if protective earmarks are eliminated. `` There will be constant warfare and conflict, no collegiality among the competing groups,'' she said. In addition to family planning efforts, agriculture and health programs are also likely to be vulnerable to cuts, she said. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> had hinted at some of the new directions in an article in the February issue of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, in which he said `` our current program suffers from too great a concentration on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, too much emphasis on military sales ... and too great an emphasis on immediate political objectives.'' In the current fiscal year, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> will recieve half of the total $ 15 billion <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid budget, with another large slice going to other strategically important allies such as <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. Relatively little is left for <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and others among the world's poorest countries. In inflation-adjusted dollars, this year's aid total is the same as Americans spent in 1977, and represents an all-time low for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a percentage of its gross national product. For the first time this year, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is surpassing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as the world's largest donor country. The report's authors hope it will be the framework for construction of this year's foreign aid legislation, but they acknowledge their approach will be a hard sell. Foreign aid is among the least-popular government programs, and budget constraints mean it will be under an even greater than usual squeeze this time. `` As the pie shrinks, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, interest groups, departments and agencies will each fight to protect their particular interest,'' the report stated. `` In sum, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will have to do more with available resources.'' Under the new system, aid programs would be evaluated by how well they achieve their goals, rather than focusing on heavy accounting and reporting requirements that have turned aid programs into a bureaucratic nightmare, the task force said. The act would establish a new <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to administer its programs as the successor to the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, which now handles that task.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators forged ahead Wednesday with separate but similar proposals to bar speaking fees and restrict other outside income should a 50 percent congressional pay raise become law Feb. 8. A bipartisan draft document, given out to senators and obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, compares the latest <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> proposals on outside income. Both packages would ban honoraria, including fees for speeches, appearances and articles, upon enactment of the raise that would boost congressional salaries from $ 89,500 to $ 135,000. Leaders in both houses have made clear that honoraria would continue if the pay raise is defeated because members do n't want to suffer a loss of income. Rank-and-file <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members currently can retain $ 26,850 and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> members $ 35,800 in honoraria. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plan includes a contingency that would permit retention of some honoraria if the raise is eventually scaled back. The pay plan now before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can only be defeated if both houses reject it. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is virtually certain to turn the raise down, but the question of whether the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will vote on it depends on a survey of members' intentions ordered by Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. Under the honoraria proposals, both houses would permit such fees to be donated to charity on a member's behalf. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plan would limit the donation to $ 2,000 per appearance and require members to list on financial disclosure forms the amount, the payer and the recipient of the donation. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plans would allow groups that invite members to an event to continue paying for travel. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would direct its ethics committee to issue rules and regulations defining acceptable limits. House Majority Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., has told reporters there would likely be a time restriction on <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members' travel, with exceptions made for multi-day events The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> draft would prohibit members from receiving any pension benefits from honoraria given as a charitable donation. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plan would go further, prohibiting conversion of any of the donations to a member's personal use. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> plan would limit all outside earned income to 15 percent of a member's salary, half the current 30 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> also would end a provision in federal law that has allowed 190 House members, in office before 1980, to accumulate $ 39 million in campaign funds that could be converted to personal use. The measure would become effective in January 1991, giving <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members one chance to retire with the money. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> already has a rule prohibiting such conversion. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> proposal would incorporate restrictions on members that already exist under <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rules. The restrictions include a ban on affiliating with business entities for compensation, a prohibition on practicing a profession except part-time teaching, and a ban on serving as an officer or board member on a publicly held or regulated corporation. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, have promised that honoraria packages will be taken up immediately if the pay raise becomes law next Wednesday.

<HEAD>Investigation Launched Into Allegations of Mass Grave</HEAD>

 Authorities are probing allegations that Kurdish guerrillas were buried in a mass grave near the garbage dump of a southeastern city, the local prosecutor said Wednesday. <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Erdogdu </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that a preliminary investigation is checking allegations published in the Sunday edition of the leftist weekly 2000ne <PERSON> Dogru </PERSON> -LRB- Toward 2000 -RRB-. He did not elaborate. The weekly reported that Kurdish guerrillas killed in shootouts with security forces, as well as suspects who died in custody, were buried in a mass grave near the city of <LOCATION> Siirt </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> Siirt </LOCATION> garbage dump is full of bodies,'' the magazine quoted <PERSON> Zubeyir </PERSON> <PERSON> Aydar </PERSON>, a lawyer and the former local chief of the main opposition <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Populist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, as saying. Kurds comprise an estimated one-fifth of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s 55 million people. Kurdish guerrillas, members of the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kurdish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, have been fighting government forces in southeast <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> since 1984 to set up an independent state, leaving hundreds of people dead. The magazine quoted <PERSON> Bedria </PERSON> <PERSON> Akan </PERSON>, whose son <PERSON> Hasan </PERSON> <PERSON> Akar </PERSON> died in detention in April 1985, as saying his body was never given to the family, and she heard rumors it was dumped in the alleged mass grave. The report said relatives of missing people in the city had been demanding that officials dig open the riverbed. It did not say how many people were missing. The weekly said <PERSON> Hayrettin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozakcioglu </PERSON>, the regional governor for the southeast provinces, acknowledged that three Kurdish guerrillas, killed in a shootout last February, were buried near the site when nobody claimed the bodies. `` I have no other knowledge,'' it quoted the governor as saying. The governor could not be reached by phone to comment on the report. officials in <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s capital, also had no comment. Last month, authorities arrested 400 people suspected of aiding the guerrillas. Opposition parties charged that some of the suspects were mistreated and a few were forced to eat human excrement. Local authorities denied the charges. Kurds also populate portions of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and the Soviet republics of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. Kurdish rebels have also fought for autonomy in northeastern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Warring Factions Fail to Compromise at Communist Meeting</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A marathon debate of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s deeply divided <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> ended Wednesday with no compromise and a stern call for the party to adopt reforms. `` We are divided on fundamental questions,'' committee member <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrhovec </PERSON> said late Tuesday. The split was so bad, he said, `` we already have two different, clearly ideologically defined parties.'' The first and most important part of Wednesday's meeting ended with a speech by national party chief <PERSON> Stipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON>, who quashed attempts to oust him by Serbian and other conservatives. But the session continued with a laborious discussion of personnel issues, focusing on <PERSON> Azem </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON>, a former party chief in restive <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> province. The only agreement reached was that the party hold an emergency congress before the end of this year to try again to overcome the rift in the leadership over economic and political targets. The three-day meeting was marked by verbal clashes between liberals advocating greater political pluralism and more democracy and conservatives seeking greater central party control to overcome <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s worst crisis. <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> said the choice facing the country is one of an open market or a state-controlled one, `` between a state based on the rule of law or the revolutionary one,'' and between political pluralism or domination of a single doctrine. He urged members to create a political climate for the party to implement `` the reforms necessary to overcome the difficult situation in the country and to enable the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to stop losing battle after battle.'' <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> referred to a statement by Adm. <PERSON> Petar </PERSON> <PERSON> Simic </PERSON>, political chief of the armed forces, who warned Monday the party is `` losing battle after battle.'' `` What some describe as the battle for <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> will not be waged without the Yugoslav army,'' <PERSON> Simic </PERSON> said. The session also was marked by a sharp clash and heated exchanges over Suvar's sentiments toward <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> between the national party chief's political allies, mainly from the liberal northern republics of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION>, and supporters of hard-line <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> party chief <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>. <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> described as `` pure fabrication'' accusations that he is biased against Serbian interests. Apparently referring to Serbian hard-liners, he said: `` We have to overcome the quarrelsome and intolerant thinking that only one truth exists and that all other opinions must be defeated.'' <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> also has drawn strong support from the central republic of <LOCATION> Bosnia </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Macedonia </LOCATION> region, as well as from some delegates of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, where Albanians are a majority. `` We do n't have time for compromises,'' said <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabani </PERSON>, an ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON>. `` A battle is being waged to liquidate this Central Committee, the Presidium -LRB- Politburo -RRB- and its president, according to a well-known scenario. `` The same scenario would then be used on the -LRB- federal state -RRB- presidency,'' <PERSON> Sabani </PERSON> said in clear reference to <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> and his alleged ambitions in national politics. Conversely, a <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> speaker asked, `` Can this leadership take us out of the crisis?'' The final decision was left to the 23-member ruling Politburo, but it is highly unlikely it will relieve <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> before his term expires in June. The next scheduled party congress is to take place in 1990. The extraordinary congress is to take place at an unspecified date later this year.

<DATELINE>LUMBERTON, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A year after being taken hostage by two shotgun-wielding Indians, the staff of The Robesonian made jokes and fielded crank calls as they worked to get the newspaper out, their editor said Wednesday. `` We thought there might be some crank calls, and there were,'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> said. `` People called up and said ` Happy Feb. 1,' or ` Happy Anniversary.' Nothing too serious.'' A year ago Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Tuscarora </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> held up to 20 staff members hostage for 10 hours while airing charges that local officials were involved in drug trafficking. The siege ended when Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> agreed to form a task force to investigate the charges. Both Indians were found innocent of federal hostage-taking and firearms violations in October, but now each faces 14 state charges of kidnapping. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> is seeking refuge with the Shoshone-Bannock Indians in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, while <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> is awaiting an extradition hearing later this month in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> said the scene in the newsroom was much different from last year, when some terrorized staffers feared for their lives after being posted as human shields in doorways. `` There's been some joking today about the incident, which I thought was positive _ that people could joke about it,'' he said. <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> said the newspaper noted the anniversary with a long story interviewing leaders from the county's black, Indian and white communities about changes that have taken place in the last year. The takeover, and the fatal shooting of Indian judicial candidate <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> a month later, resulted in the establishment of a human relations council for the county, a public defender's office and a second <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judgeship that <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> filled with an Indian lawyer. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> on Tuesday sued <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, state Attorney General <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburg </PERSON> and 18 other state and county officials. The lawsuit asks a federal judge to block their extradition and prosecution on the kidnapping charges because their civil rights have been violated. <PERSON> Thornburg </PERSON> said Tuesday the state will press for the extradition and prosecution of the men despite the lawsuit. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attorney </ORGANIZATION>'s Office in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> has issued a federal warrant for <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> charging him with unlawful flight from prosecution. <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Dupree </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the office, said Wednesday that the warrant issued Monday would allow federal agents to arrest <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> and return him to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> to face the kidnapping charges. An <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> said whether <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents could go on the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reservation </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> to arrest <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> would depend on local arrangements with the reservation. `` Some reservations have asked the federal government to act as a policing authority on the reservation,'' the spokesman said. `` Some reservations have said ` No, we want to do it ourselves.'

<HEAD>Canada Approves Test Of Advanced U.S. Cruise Missile</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government will let the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> test an unarmed version of a highly advanced cruise missile over western <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the defense minister said Wednesday. The missile will fly from the <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION>, across northeastern <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and over northern <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION> to a military weapons range on the <LOCATION> Alberta-Saskatchewan </LOCATION> border. The missile, known as the AGM-129A, is more advanced than other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air-launched cruise missiles tested over <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> since 1983. The low-flying, cigar-shaped weapon, which uses the stealth technology being applied to other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense systems, is better able to avoid radar detection, officials say. Defense Minister <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> said the missile test is expected to be conducted before March 31. The cruise missile tests have been controversial in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> since they began. Opponents of the test argue that the missile could be used as a first-strike weapon. Supporters say it is a deterrent. The defense minister said the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact already has a significant and improving cruise missile capability. `` We support the pursuit of mutual arms reduction, a process that can only move ahead effectively if both sides are dealing from equivalent positions,'' <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> said. The missile is capable of carrying conventional or nuclear warheads.

<HEAD>Legislation Would Cut Global Warming by Limiting Fuel Use</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Legislation designed to reduce fossil-fuel pollutants that scientists say are creating the `` greenhouse effect,'' or global warming trend, was unveiled Wednesday by Sen. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>, D-Colo. <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> said the measure would set strict goals to reduce certain gases, such as carbon dioxide, that prevent heat rays from escaping the Earth's atmosphere, thus raising global temperatures `` The policy we are proposing today would have other economic benefits _ reducing oil imports, for example, and alleviating the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit,'' said <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The bill proposes studying ways to power automobiles and other motor vehicles with natural gas instead of the dirtier-burning gasoline and diesel. The bill, supported by a bipartisan group of 21 senators, also calls for reducing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> emissions of carbon dioxide by 20 percent by the end of the century by developing a national energy policy that stresses energy conservation and promotes the development of alternative and renewable energy sources. It addition, it calls for convening an international conference to adopt a binding climate-protection convention that would cut global emissions of carbon dioxide by 50 percent by the year 2015.

 Below-zero temperatures in February are not in themselves big news in the Plains, but residents found the 70-degree drops in temperatures bracing and farmers found them worrying. `` Hot chocolate, hot coffee, donuts and hot dogs, anything that's hot'' sold big Wednesday at Sapp Bros.-Sidney truck stop in western <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, said its manager, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Machamer </PERSON> Business was up about 20 percent as people came in from the cold, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Machamer </PERSON> said. But no one appeared to be stranded, he said. Police expected to give more people rides to shelters as the homeless try to get off the street, Capt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said. And the <ORGANIZATION> Cornhusker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> had a rush of 112 calls from motorists in the <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> area Wednesday morning _ 70 percent more than the previous day, most wanting jump starts, said <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, public affairs director of the <ORGANIZATION> AAA </ORGANIZATION> motor club. Farmers and ranchers faced particular problems, as the temperature plunge endangered both crops and animals. `` It's a shock to anything's system when you have a 100-degree drop in -LRB- wind-chill -RRB- temperature,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beef </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Barb </PERSON> <PERSON> Rishel </PERSON> of North Platte said her husband, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>, went to their ranch south of town Tuesday night to be sure the herd bulls were properly bedded down and to keep an eye on cows that were calving. Sheds, straw and heat lamps are used for newborns and their mothers, Mrs. <PERSON> Rishel </PERSON> said. The cold wind had winter wheat growers worried. `` The thing that would concern us most is the lack of snow cover, and then the second part that concerns us is the sudden change in temperature,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Baenziger </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska-Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> agronomy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION>. `` Normally when we have these kinds of temperatures, ... the crop gets used to being cold,'' he said. `` Now, we've got something that's unbelieveable _ record highs, and suddenly within one day we go to cold temperatures.''

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, at the request of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, has sent a small team of military experts to teach Afghan rebels and refugees how to clear land mines, officials said Wednesday. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team, consisting of about 30 trainers and support staff, has been sent to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and will work with Afghan rebels and refugees in camps on the Pakistani side of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, the officials said. Lt.

Spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> charged that `` unprecedented destruction'' has occurred as Soviet troops withdraw. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has agreed under a U.N.-sponsored settlement to withdraw all of its troops by Feb. 15.

The spokesman added the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> had designated the effort `` Operation Salam,'' but the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> is calling its contribution `` Operation Safe Passage.''

<HEAD>New AIDS Aerosol Drug Could Help Tens of Thousands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Tens of thousands of AIDS patients could be helped by an experimental drug soon to be approved in aerosol form by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, AIDS activists said Wednesday. The drug, pentamidine, is believed to have some effect in preventing pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, which causes an estimated 60 percent of AIDS deaths. `` It is a dramatic breakthrough in terms of offering a preventive treatment for the most deadly'' infections that strike people whose immune systems have been depleted by AIDS, said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>, executive director of the Gay and <ORGANIZATION> Lesbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approval of widespread distribution of the aerosol drug is `` imminent,'' <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> McLearn </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> would not say how many people it expected would have access to the drug, but <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> estimated `` tens of thousands of people would be eligible.'' Pentamidine was approved five years ago for use as an injectable drug. The spray version under <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> review would make it easier to take into the lungs where pneumocystis first shows up. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> decision would be in a special category that allows widespread distribution of promising drugs before they are approved for commercial distribution. Normally, the government requires years of studies before permitting general use of a drug. Until a drug receives full approval, its use normally is not covered by government or private health insurance policies. Often during experimental use of a drug, the manufacturer distributes it free to patients. <ORGANIZATION> LyphoMed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Rosemont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, the leading supplier of injectable pentamidine and the company expected to be licensed to supply the aerosol version, said it would release information about its plans for the drug next week. AIDS activists have complained that the government has moved too slowly in permitting the use of promising drugs for people who have the AIDS virus. However, activists praised the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> action, which is expected next week. `` It's quite important as a symbol, an example of the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> moving faster than it has in the past,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hannon </PERSON>, associate director of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION>, which conducted one of the studies on the aerosol form of pentamidine. `` They've talked a lot about a faster approval process for drugs for life-threatening diseases like cancer and AIDS, and this is encouraging,'' he said. <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> said, `` It's an indication that the process is working better.'' But he added, `` People are cautious because they do n't know how the drug will be available and the conditions'' <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> will place on its use. Not all AIDS activists, however, praised the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s work on pentamidine. `` This should have been fully approved by now,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> of a New York-based group called AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power. About 50 members of the group rode a bus to <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, on Wednesday to attend a meeting of a government panel that is studying ways to reduce approval time for AIDS and cancer drugs. AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The chief victims of AIDS have been homosexual men and intravenous drug abusers. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> said that as of Jan. 30, 84,985 AIDS cases had been reported in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. More than half, 48,582, have died. There have been 2,228 new cases reported since Jan. 1, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said.

 A 71-year-old woman who maintains a ramshackle homestead at an undeveloped state park has sued the state in an effort to prevent her eviction. In the lawsuit filed Tuesday in <ORGANIZATION> Derby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the eviction of <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gagnon </PERSON> would be unnecessary and would shorten her life. `` I personally feel if they take her out of there and demolish that little compound she has put together and put her in a nursing home, she wo n't live very long,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> is seeking an injunction preventing the state from trying to evict <PERSON> Gagnon </PERSON>, who has cancer, for five years or for the rest of her life, whichever is shorter. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said he decided on a five-year time limit because it would take the state at least that long to come up with funds to develop the park, on land along <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Carothers </PERSON>, the state's commissioner of environmental protection, said she had no comment because she had n't read <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' suit. <PERSON> Carothers </PERSON>' department is pursuing eviction of <PERSON> Gagnon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gagnon </PERSON>'s homestead is near the site of her former home, which the state condemned and demolished in 1971 to make way for the park. She has lived since in a makeshift compound that includes a trailer and coops where she keeps chickens. State authorities servied notice in November that they wanted her off the land after receiving a complaint from <LOCATION> Milford </LOCATION> health officials that her presence represented a nuisance to the public health. During a summer inspection of the property, health officials said they found bags of human sewage piled up behind her living quarters. The homestead is served by no public utilities. State officials said they also took action at this time because development work is expected to begin this summer and they want to avoid delays.

<TEXT>
 On the eve of top-level U.S.-Japanese talks, five senators on Wednesday urged President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to conduct a complete review of a pending deal under which <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would receive $ 8 billion in advanced aircraft technology. In a letter to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the senators said the deal involving the FSX fighter raises serious questions about its `` long-term impact on the health and competitiveness of the American aerospace industry.'' Sending the letter were Sens. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.M. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill.; <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Ky.; <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>, They noted that during the visit of Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> on Thursday and Friday there likely will be `` intense pressure ... to give the full commitment of the president to the program.'' `` However, to do so without a full assessment of the program's long-term impact would not be in the best interests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' the senators told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Under the proposed deal, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> would develop and produce a new-generation Japanese fighter using technology for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-16 fighter obtained from <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION>, which would serve as a subcontractor to <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION>. This `` co-development'' effort would be in lieu of directly purchasing fighters from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or manufacturing them under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> license. Critics of the deal contend it would delay strengthening of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s defense forces, due to time needed to design and build the FSX, and go too far in furthering development of the Japanese aircraft industry in competition with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In their letter to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the senators complained that negotiations over the <ORGANIZATION> FSX </ORGANIZATION> have been carried out by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> without involvement of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative and the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are requesting that you order a complete review of the FSX program within the administration, including the departments of <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, as well as the Office of the Trade Representative and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> science office,'' the letter said. It added: `` We hope that your administration will refrain from any further commitments on the FSX until that review has been completed and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been fully consulted.''

 Nine more potential jurors were picked Wednesday for <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s Iran-Contra trial in a laborious effort interrupted by the judge's threat to hold a TV reporter in contempt for making jury selection even tougher. So far, there are 16 people in the pool of prospects from which 12 jurors and six alternates eventually will be chosen. The judge in the case said at day's end he hoped the jury could be selected Monday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> angrily said he was considering holding <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> in contempt of court. He said an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> account Tuesday night `` appears to be a deliberate effort to obstruct'' jury selection by airing congressional testimony <PERSON> North </PERSON> had given covering the same subjects on which he now faces charges. The judge's comments showed continuing concern about the difficulty of picking jurors unfamiliar <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s previous testimony about the Iran-Contra affair. He testified in nationally televised congressional hearings in 1987 under a grant of limited immunity from prosecution. North himself has steered clear of public comments going into and out of the courthouse. However, he cracked a few jokes about the trial in remarks to a religious group at a breakfast early Tuesday. He said he could stay only a few minutes because `` I have an appearance elsewhere that I have been invited to.'' Then he said, `` Normally in order to speak, I have to have a subpoena.'' Before jury selection resumed after lunch, <PERSON> North </PERSON> signed several autographs for an admirer in the courtroom, then gave him a friendly slap on the shoulder. The 12 felony charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON> include lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and then-Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> about his role in the Iran-Contra affair and illegally using a tax-exempt foundation to help finance a `` secret war'' against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government. `` It seemed like the whole world was talking about that testimony,'' defense lawyer <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said in court, trying to probe a prospective juror's knowledge of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s public admissions two years ago that he lied and destroyed <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> documents. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> excused three prospective jurors who said they had seen <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s congressional testimony, including a department store clerk who acknowledged that she `` heard something'' about <PERSON> North </PERSON> shredding documents on one of the dozens of TV sets displayed where she worked. But the judge brushed aside defense objections to inclusion of others, notably a hospital laboratory technician who said she had seen North on television but could n't `` remember anything he said.'' `` Usually I turned the channel'' to another program, she said. North lawyer <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> urged the judge to abide `` by the principle that no juror be seated who saw Col. <PERSON> North </PERSON> testify.'' But <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said, `` I have to take into account your client was on TV a great deal under all kinds of circumstances. She did say she saw him but she did not say she heard him.'' Another chosen for the jury pool, a mental health administrator who has testified dozens of times in court, said she had n't paid much attention to <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s testimony because she had just changed jobs. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> objected to her selection, calling her `` almost a professional witness.'' He also said she received newspapers at her home that delved into <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s testimony with such prominent headlines that she `` could not miss critical portions of his testimony.'' At the start of the second day of jury selection, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he had `` not made up my mind'' but was considering whether <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>'s account of Tuesday's proceeding provided an `` appropriate basis for a contempt action. The judge said <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, who was not in court during <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s remarks but was there later, `` took pains'' to tell viewers that if they watched the excerpts of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s congressional testimony they would not have to serve on the jury <PERSON> Roone </PERSON> <PERSON> Arledge </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement distributed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>: `` Correspondent <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> reported fairly and accurately what has been said in public regarding the North case. The public's right to be informed need not conflict with the fair administration of justice. Last night's ` World News Tonight' segment informed our viewers about events already having taken place in public arenas They can not now be erased.'' North's admissions to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can not be used against him as evidence, and <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has ruled that no one who heard the former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide's congressional testimony could sit on the jury. The judge plans to pick a panel of 50 prospective jurors before allowing prosecutors and defense attorneys to exercise an as-yet unspecified number of peremptory challenges. Seven were picked Tuesday. At the end of Wednesday's session, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said questioning had `` gone very well'' and he hoped to `` move for jury selection on Monday.'' Defense lawyers for the retired <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel did not object to seating an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> sergeant who served from 1963 to 1978, had a top secret security clearance and was in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> during the Tet offensive. The man now works in a security job and said he did n't recognize <PERSON> North </PERSON>, a decorated fellow veteran of the Vietnam War.

<HEAD>Government Claims Foreign Plot Against Greece</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government said Wednesday it has been the target of foreign secret service plots to destabilize democracy. Government spokesman <PERSON> Sotiris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostopoulos </PERSON> commented on a pro-government newspaper report that recent scandals were a plot by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to undermine Socialist Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, whose government is driving a hard bargain in talks on a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases treaty. `` <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> has certainly been the target of foreign and domestic circles,'' <PERSON> Kostopoulos </PERSON> said at his daily press briefing. He did not elaborate. The <ORGANIZATION> Avriani </ORGANIZATION> newspaper alleged that the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and the Mafia are orchestrating a plan to slander slander <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> so that `` the removal of the American bases by 1999 will not be realized.'' `` Americans do n't like him since he is not a yes-man,'' it said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> refused comment. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is negotiating a new military bases agreement with the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> government after an agreement expired in December. Thirteen rounds of talks have failed to resolve the major issues, and another round is scheduled next month to determine whether four major installations remain or are closed down. <PERSON> Avriani </PERSON> said the alleged plot was based on the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Psychological Warfare Manual and involved using the political opposition and the press to slander the premier and to implicate government officials in scandals and crimes. Multimillion-dollar financial and arms scandals have plagued the Socialist government for months and have caused the resignation of seven Cabinet members since November. The entire political opposition has called for <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s resignation so early general elections could be held before the government's term is up in June The prime minister has refused to step down and described the scandals reported by most of the daily press as slanderous. The latest scandal broke out Tuesday over how much was paid to buy 40 French-made Mirage 2000 jet fighters. The conservative <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> party reported that the government said it paid $ 40.5 million for each aircraft when purchased in 1985. The government, however, announced that the price was $ 19.4 million and angrily denied anti-government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Eleftheros </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Typos </ORGANIZATION>' allegation that <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> kept some of the money earmarked for the purchase. <PERSON> Kostopoulos </PERSON> said this latest allegation was an example of a `` miserable scenario of slandering the premier.''

 Troops backed by helicopter gunships battled Moslem rebels in a southern province, and 43 people were killed, the military said Wednesday. Tuesday's battle in <LOCATION> Zamboanga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sur </LOCATION> <LOCATION> province </LOCATION>, about 500 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, was the bloodiest clash with Moslem rebels since a cease-fire went into effect in 1986. Also, a judge in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> on Wednesday acquitted a former associate of ex-President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> of rebellion charges in connection with an attempt to topple the government of President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. The Aug. 28, 1987, coup attempt left more than 50 dead and was the most serious attempt to overthrow Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who became president after a popular and military uprising ousted <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> in 1986. The battle Tuesday between <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops and Moslem rebels claimed the lives of 32 guerrillas, eight civilians, two government militiamen and one soldier. Reports said fighting erupted after about 300 rebels from the <ORGANIZATION> Moro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Moro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> attacked the village of <LOCATION> Kulasian </LOCATION> to avenge the deaths of some colleagues. Gunboats were dispatched to the area to prevent the rebels from escaping by sea, reports said. Troops then conducted an air and ground assault. Both the <ORGANIZATION> Moro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and the rival <ORGANIZATION> Moro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> have been fighting for Moslem rule on <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> and other southern islands since 1972. But fighting has been reduced to sporadic skirmishes since the guerrillas agreed to a cease-fire in 1986. Officials estimate that more than 50,000 people were killed at the height of the Moslem rebellion in the mid-1970s. In <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, Judge <PERSON> Maximiano </PERSON> <PERSON> Asuncion </PERSON> ruled there was insufficient evidence to convict former provincial Gov. <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Dulay </PERSON> of rebellion charges in connection with his takeover of the provincial capitol building in <LOCATION> Quirino </LOCATION> province north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. But the judge sentenced <PERSON> Dulay </PERSON> to 10 months in prison and fined him $ 50 for trying to strangle then-Quirino Gov. <PERSON> Renicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Delizo </PERSON> and holding several employees during the takeover. <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Dulay </PERSON>'s takeover of the building was not part of a `` public uprising'' necessary to convict him of rebellion. The incident took place as more than 2,000 mutineers led by renegade Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> stormed the presidential palace and media and military facilities in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. At least 53 people were killed and more than 300 were wounded in the coup attempt. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> escaped from a prison ship with some of his guards in April and has not been found. <PERSON> Dulay </PERSON> had been held in a Quirino jail since March 1987 in connection with the slaying of two <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> supporters during the 1986 presidential election between <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. Witnesses testified that <PERSON> Dulay </PERSON> was released during the coup attempt and, dressed in combat fatigues, led a force to the capitol building, where he herded <PERSON> Delizo </PERSON> and others into the governor's office at gunpoint

<HEAD>Government Wins Appeal on Release of Classified Transcripts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court has ruled that a man charged in a <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> hijacking is not entitled to inspect classified transcripts of his conversations with an informant that were covertly recorded by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. A three-judge panel of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here ruled that the trial judge in the case of <PERSON> Fawaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> was wrong in ordering the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to turn over the classified documents. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> had ruled that <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>, charged with leading a 1985 hijacking of a Jordanian airliner in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, was entitled to see the transcripts of his conversations with <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamdan </PERSON> to prepare his defense. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had appealed <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s ruling, contending that disclosure of the transcripts would jeopardize the intelligence methods used to intercept the conversations. The appellate panel agreed, saying, `` The contents of the transcripts were on the whole not relevant to the defendant's guilt or innocence and the few statements that were even marginally relevant were not sufficiently helpful or beneficial to the defense to overcome the classified information privilege.'' The court, in an opinion dated Monday by Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sentelle </PERSON>, said the government had a legitimate national-security concern about releasing the transcripts. `` Much of the government's security interest in the conversations lies not so much in the contents of the conversations as in the time, place, and nature of the government's ability to intercept the conversations at all,'' <PERSON> Sentelle </PERSON> said in an opinion joined by judges <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Silberman </PERSON>. `` Things that do not make sense to the district judge would make all too much sense to a foreign counterintelligence specialist who could learn much about this nation's intelligence-gathering capabilities from what these documents revealed about sources and methods,'' the court said. The panel also chided <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> for inadvertently disclosing classified information in his Oct. 25, 1988 order, which was quickly edited to delete the sensitive material. `` Because members of the federal judiciary and their staffs are generally not familiar with security procedures, we think it wise that judges within this circuit direct their respective court security officers to review orders, decisions, and memoranda before they are released,'' the court said. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> was arrested in September 1987 after he was lured by <PERSON> Hamdan </PERSON> aboard an FBI-chartered yacht off <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. He is charged with leading a group of four other armed men who boarded a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jordanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> jet on June 11, 1985, in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and forced the plane to fly to several locations in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. The hijackers blew up the plane in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> after allowing the crew and passengers, including several Americans, to leave. The appeal, made under the Classified Information Procedures Act, is the second taken by prosecutors in the case. The same appeals court last year overruled <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s decision that <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>' confession to <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents had been illegally obtained. The case is scheduled to go to trial Feb. 14 but the proceeding could be delayed by further pre-trial matters. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> is being tried under a federal law that gives the government jurisdiction to prosecute hijackings overseas that involve Americans.

 The number of `` cocaine babies'' born in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> rose to 978 during the last half of 1988, a 78.8 percent increase over the same period a year earlier, officials said. `` We had predicted this, but we were astounded that these numbers were increasing to the point that our fears were answered,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. `` Cocaine babies'' are those who have had the drug in their systems either as fetuses or as infants, ingesting it through their mother's breast milk, said agency spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneidman </PERSON>. The babies are n't addicted, but the drug's effects may linger long after the narcotic itself is gone, he said. No end to the rise is in sight, making it more expensive and difficult for the department to find foster homes for the children, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Wednesday from <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>. The total of 978 cocaine babies for the last six months of 1988 compares with 547 babies during the same period in 1987, the department said. About ninth-tenths of cases during both periods were in <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which includes <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and surrounding suburbs. In addition to drug abuse, the cases raise concerns about child abuse. Babies whose mothers take cocaine during pregnancy _ even once _ can be born with problems that make them harder to care for once they are home. Besides seizures and breathing problems, such babies are irritable. An addicted mother who comes home with a `` crying, screaming'' baby is much more likely to abuse it or neglect it, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` That's the kind of child that ends up in our system,'' he said, noting that recent increases in child-abuse cases are partly attributable to drug-affected infants whose parents lose patience in caring for them. Drug-affected babies have a higher rate of premature birth, are more likely to be retarded and are at an increased risk for crib death, among other problems, said Dr. <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chasnoff </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Perinatal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dependence </ORGANIZATION> at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. The problem is not limited to big cities or states where cocaine is a notorious problem, <PERSON> Chasnoff </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` Places you'd never expect are seeing cocaine-exposed infants,'' he said, citing <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Medford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` The numbers are escalating rapidly,'' <PERSON> Chasnoff </PERSON> said. `` There's no question that stronger prevention programs have to be instituted across the country. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> estimates that 375,000 babies _ or 10 percent of those born each year _ have illegal drugs in their system, said <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Daro </PERSON>, research director for the Chicago-based group. Doctors and hospitals are required to report cocaine babies to the family services department, <PERSON> Schneidman </PERSON> said.

 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team of experts and 50 tons of equipment headed to the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> on Wednesday to battle a huge oil spill that experts said was killing wildlife in the pristine polar region. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> cargo plane was bound for the southern city of <LOCATION> Punta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arenas </LOCATION>, where the equipment will be transferred to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> research vessel, the Polar <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> said. Officials stressed they still were trying to assess the magnitude of the spill, which was caused by a sunken Argentine supply ship, but said it represented the first major environmental threat to the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said the crippled Argentine ship carried 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel and that an `` incurable disaster'' would result if all the fuel leaked into the unspoiled waters in the region. In <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, the Argentine navy played down the spill and said it did not pose a serious ecological threat. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials on Wednesday launched a massive effort to stem the spill, which was four miles in diameter and moving to the southwest, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Talmadge </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. The spill occurred after the <ORGANIZATION> Bahia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paraiso </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Paradise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, an Argentine navy vessel, ran aground on Saturday in the <LOCATION> Bismarck </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION>, about 600 miles south of the southern tip of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and 1 -LCB- miles from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>. All passengers and crew were rescued, but the vessel floated free in heavy seas and then capsized Tuesday night, spilling barrels of oil and several hundred propane gas containers into the water, <PERSON> Talmadge </PERSON> said. `` It has leaked oil,'' he said. `` We're not sure whether the oil leak is continuing. The water surrounding the ship is covered with a couple of centimeters -LRB- about an inch -RRB- of oil. There is a sheen of oil in a much wider area around the ship, including evidence of oil on the coastline of the several islands there.'' A private yacht 10-15 miles away reported earlier that it had seen oil patches on the water, he said. Oil also was spotted at the research station. `` Wildlife has already begun to be affected,'' including krill, the small crustaceans that form the basis of the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> food chain, <PERSON> Talmadge </PERSON> said. `` Birds which have eaten the krill are showing behavior differences,'' he said. `` One dead penguin had been found as of a few hours ago.'' A <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> statement said about 12,000 pairs of penguins and other sea birds nested in the area last year. `` In a few weeks, hatchling penguins will leave their nests and enter the now-fouled <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> waters, as will their parents,'' said the statement. A team of 15 experts and 52 tons of equipment on a giant <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> C-5B cargo plane left <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, on Wednesday. It was to arrive here on Thursday and then go by ship across the Drake Passage to the accident site along the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> by Monday, <PERSON> Talmadge </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> manages the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antarctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, which includes Palmer Station, a scientific outpost. <PERSON> Talmadge </PERSON> said scientists from the station have been going out in boats to assess the damage and try to catch the oil barrels and propane containers floating in the water. `` We're trying to get those, but that's a pretty massive project,'' he said. `` We're using all the lifeboats from the ship and any other boats we can get hold of in the area.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> is organizing the clean-up mission, with assistance from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, an Argentine navy spokesman said: `` There could be a small stain'' from the release of oil in the engine room of the ship. `` Anything else, no,'' He said. The ship carried tourists as well as fuel for several polar stations. All 300 ship occupants were taken to the Palmer station after the vessel ran aground. Another <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Renerie </PERSON>, said in a telephone interview that the cargo plane was carrying a 35-foot `` skimming boat'' for scooping up spilled oil and pumping it into floating tanks; a small tugboat; inflatable booms to contain the spill, and a special truck for loading and unloading the equipment. He said it was accompanied by a crew from two private <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> clean-up companies, <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Global </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>.

 Here is a list of responses by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members to a survey conducted Jan. 13-31 by groups opposed to the proposed pay raise. The survey was conducted by <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION>, a consumer advocacy group founded by <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>; the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxpayers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, a non-partisan organization of fiscal conservatives; and <ORGANIZATION> Coalitions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative organization headed by activist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> on Wednesday offered to withdraw soldiers from some cities in the occupied lands if Palestinians agree to limited autonomy as an interim solution to the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. Palestinian leaders rejected the idea, saying they would settle for nothing less than a Palestinian state. It was <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s most conciliatory remark yet on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s future role in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. `` Compared to his old stand, he has moved a step, but it is a far step from meeting the demands or conditions of the Palestinian people. We ca n't accept it,'' said <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, considered the top pro-PLO leader in the occupied lands. Also Wednesday, 10 Arab teen-agers were wounded in clashes with troops in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, including a 13-year-old boy shot in the head with a rubber bullet, Arab hospital officials said. The army confirmed five wounded. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, a firebomb was hurled at a religious seminary for Jewish settlers. A second firebomb was thrown at the troops that arrived to conduct searches, settlers said. There were no injuries or damage. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> presented his idea to reporters after speaking to a group of North American rabbis. `` The peace process will be comprised of two stages,'' he said. `` First an interim condition and this will include full autonomy. In the second stage -LRB- there will be -RRB- direct negotiations without preconditions between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> countries.'' `` At a certain stage when there is autonomy, the army will leave several urban centers and be focused in some other areas,'' he said. The withdrawal of Israeli troops from populated areas into security pockets in the occupied territories is outlined in the 1978 Camp David accords between <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has never specifically endorsed such a troop movement. Although <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> spoke of `` full autonomy'', the accords say <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would still handle the terrorities' external and internal security and foreign affairs. The Camp David accords call for electing local Palestinians to participate in peace talks with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. A five-year period of autonomy would precede negotiations on the final status of the territories. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and many Palestinians reject autonomy and the Camp <PERSON> David </PERSON> plan, saying these ideas are intended to sidestep the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and cheat the Palestinians out of a state. `` Autonomy as proposed by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is totally rejected,'' said <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Freij </PERSON>, responding to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s latest offer. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has to understand that we want a comprehensive peace settlement ... that will ultimately achieve our sovereignty over the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told the rabbis he would never meet with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and criticized Western nations for giving credibility to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s statements in December recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and renouncing terrorism. `` Our rights are questioned as we witness a large part of the world dancing at the PLO-Arafat festival, which has blinded them to reality and made them victims of delusions and deceptions,'' he said. While offering concessions in the political arena, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials have endorsed harsh army measures introduced last month to end the rebellion that began Dec. 8, 1987, and has since left 370 Palestinians and 15 Israelis dead. The new measures allow soldiers to fire plastic bullets at Palestinians fleeing riots and at those erecting roadblocks. A <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> military court Tuesday sentenced six Palestinians, including two teen-agers, to up to two years in prison for stoning military vehicles and other targets. No one was injured in the attacks. The sentences were unprecedented. In the past, stone throwers were fined or given a few months in jail. Police arrested an Israeli who allegedly planned to sell the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> information for $ 1.5 million, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said. The 40-year-old man, whose name was not released, allegedly met with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> last month. The man, detained Tuesday on his return at <LOCATION> Ben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gurion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, passed information to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials, the radio said. The report did not specify what kind of information was allegedly passed or whether any money changed hands. No charges have yet been filed. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> law passed in 1986 carries a three-year prison term for unauthorized meetings with members of terrorist groups.

<HEAD>Builder Says He Bribed Indian Leaders to Win Housing Contracts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The president of an <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> construction company testified Wednesday that he bribed Indian officials and pretended that a housewife of Indian descent was the principal owner of his firm so he could get lucrative contracts to build Indian housing. <PERSON> Kraig </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homes </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, told an investigative panel of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Indian affairs that the government's policy of requiring companies to have 51 percent Indian ownership to win Indian-related contracts was `` an invitation for fraud and fronts.'' He also said his practice of giving gifts ranging from dinner hams to expensive sports cars to Indian officials was standard procedure among those seeking construction contracts on lands of the <ORGANIZATION> Absentee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shawnee </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Chickasaw </LOCATION> tribes. <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON>, who pleaded guilty in 1985 to charges related to bribing a <LOCATION> Chickasaw </LOCATION> governor, said contracting now `` is in a shambles.'' `` Developers are all going to say we would prefer to go in and bid on a competitive basis. I tried to do that.'' <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> said. But he said he was unable to get contracts that way and soon resorted to gifts and gratuities. `` In some cases some serious bribes,'' he said. `` Initially, I wined and dined them and gave them small presents like turkeys and hams,'' <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> said of his experience with officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Absentee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shawnee </ORGANIZATION> housing authority. He said he offered the chairman of the authority _ and later the chairman of the tribe _ tickets to <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION> football games. After sending the two men to the Orange Bowl with about $ 500 in cash and paid hotel reservations, <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> said he received a contract for a 50-unit housing project on <ORGANIZATION> Absentee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shawnee </ORGANIZATION> lands. Eventually, <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> said he made a deal to kick back $ 500 on every housing unit he built and gave a recreational van and a <ORGANIZATION> Porsche </ORGANIZATION> as a means of continuing his contracting. <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> described similar dealings with housing and tribal officials of the <LOCATION> Chickasaw </LOCATION> nation, saying he paid $ 94,000 on phony invoices from the tribal governor's construction supply manufacturing company in order to get $ 14 million in contracts. The tribal governor, <PERSON> Overton </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, pleaded guilty in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> earlier this month to accepting kickbacks and has been sentenced to prison. <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> also said that in order to participate in bidding for the contracts he made an employee's wife who had an Indian relative in her ancestry a 51 percent owner of his company. `` She was a housewife,'' he said. He said she never participated in company business except to sign papers. The committee began its hearings into corruption in <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> affairs Monday and has been concentrating on the `` front'' operations. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Asbra </PERSON>, chief of the contracting division of the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, testified that the agency accepts the contractors' word that they are majority Indian-owned and does not investigate He said it is up to the Indians to police themselves and that they can complain to the <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> if they believe business that is supposed to go to native Americans is going to non-Indians. `` We do n't have the capacity to inspect fronts,'' said <PERSON> Asbra </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., who chairs the investigative panel, asked if cases involving suspected fronts could be stopped by <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> officials at the local level <PERSON> Asbra </PERSON> said that was possible. The committee will be gathering information for several weeks on alleged corruption in many facets of Indian affairs, including gaming, law enforcement, education and possible sex abuse of children. At one point, the committee went into private session to hear testimony from <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, who, as former head of a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> program for small and disadvantaged business utilization, said he had counseled participants in a minority set-aside program established by the <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Among those he counseled was <ORGANIZATION> Kinross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. According to a statement released by the committee staff, <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> told the panel that <ORGANIZATION> Kinross </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> firm that manufactures munitions, was an Indian front company controlled by wealthy businessmen, including some with connections to <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, a scandal-plagued <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, defense contractor. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> has pleaded guilty to accepting a bribe in connection with the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> affair and is cooperating with the federal government in cases related to <ORGANIZATION> SBA </ORGANIZATION> contractors. He said <ORGANIZATION> Kinross </ORGANIZATION> used one man as the applicant for admittance to the minority program, though until 1982 the man was not enrolled in any Indian tribe. <ORGANIZATION> Kinross </ORGANIZATION> applied for, and received minority certification and then won multi-million dollar government contracts. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said he had never seen a start-up company supported by so many government loans.

<TEXT>
 Federal investigators on Wednesday for the first time blamed cocaine use by a pilot as a contributing factor in a commercial airline crash in which passengers were killed. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> concluded that pilot <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Silver </PERSON>, who was killed in a Jan. 19, 1988, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> commuter crash along with eight other people, used cocaine several hours before the flight from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Durango </LOCATION>. Although board investigators said <PERSON> Silver </PERSON>, 36, did not have enough cocaine in his system to be `` high'' and his co-pilot was believed to be controlling the Trans-Colorado aircraft's descent into <LOCATION> Durango </LOCATION>, the board concluded that cocaine contributed to his `` ineffective monitoring of an unstabilized approach.'' The co-pilot, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, 42, was also killed in the crash. The plane carried 15 passengers. Medical analysis found traces of cocaine in the pilot's blood and urine, investigators said. They also said a girlfriend of the pilot reportedly claimed he had taken cocaine the night before the crash, although she refused to talk to investigators. Board officials said it was the first time that cocaine use by a pilot had been ruled a factor in a crash involving a regularly scheduled commercial passenger flight. Alcohol use has been blamed in some previous accidents. Board investigator <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauch </PERSON> said evidence showed that Silver had used cocaine between 10 and 18 hours before the flight. He said there was not enough evidence to determine whether <PERSON> Silver </PERSON> was a heavy user of the drug. Board chemist <PERSON> Merritt </PERSON> <PERSON> Birky </PERSON> said that regular use of cocaine could cause fatigue and a preoccupation with cocaine, affecting performance of a pilot long after the substance was no longer giving the user a high. The <ORGANIZATION> Fairchild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> 3 aircraft operated by now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> Trans-Colorado </ORGANIZATION> airlines crashed on a hillside five miles short of the <LOCATION> Durango </LOCATION> runway in light snow. The board concluded that the plane began its descent at too high an altitude and speed to land safely. The board also said the pilot had falsely obtained a medical certificate required for flying by denying that he had a record involving drunken driving. Investigators said <PERSON> Silver </PERSON> had several traffic citations, including some involving drunken driving. The board also said the co-pilot had a prior employment and training record that indicated `` deficiencies in performing instrument procedures.'' The plane was landing at night in light snow and a cloud cover. `` The probable cause of this accident was the first officer's flying and the captain's ineffective monitoring of an unstabilized approach which resulted in a descent below the published descent profile,'' the board said in a report adopted after more than three hours of discussion in an open hearing `` Contributing to the accident was the degradation of the captain's performance resulting from his use of cocaine before the accident,'' the board said. The board recommended that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> require inspectors to personally examine special approaches such as the one into <LOCATION> Durango </LOCATION>. The approach is over mountainous terrain and sometimes referred to as a `` slam-dunk'' approach because of the steep descent that is sometimes necessary. Board members said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> should help airlines obtain more information from previous employers about the piloting skills and abilities of prospective pilots. Staff investigators told the board Silver earned about $ 23,000 a year and his co-pilot half as much. Board chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> characterized the salaries as `` incredibly low.'' The board said there was no technical problem with the aircraft and air traffic control did not contribute to the crash. But it said a ground proximity warning device, if the plane had had one, might have prevented the accident. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> is considering rules to require smaller passenger planes to install the devices which are used on all larger passenger airliners. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> last March released a toxicology report that showed Silver had .022 micrograms per millileter of benzoylecgonine, the principle metabolite of cocaine, in his bloodstream. The report also said he had 1.8 micrograms per millileter of metabolized cocaine and .022 micrograms of cocaine in his urine. Two negligence lawsuits have been filed against <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> as a result of the crash. The plane owned Trans-Colorado was leased to <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary that flies under the name <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>. One suit, filed on behalf of <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> LaVigne </PERSON>, wife of the late <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> LaVigne </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, who was killed in the crash, seeks unspecified damages because of the cocaine found in Silver's system. <PERSON> LaVigne </PERSON>'s lawsuit also alleges the airline failed to check records of both Silver and <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, which `` would have cast serious doubt upon the propriety of hiring those pilots.'' The other lawsuit, filed by relatives of the late <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Emergy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, also cites Silver's cocaine use.

<TEXT>
 A judge recommended bail of $ 12,500 for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>, an American linked to the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels and charged by Costa Rican authorities with drug trafficking, <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>'s attorney said Wednesday. Attorney <PERSON> Elda </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON> also said proceedings against <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> were ordered transferred to the northern city of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carlos </LOCATION>. Costa Rican authorities arrested <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> Jan. 13 on charges of drug trafficking and violating <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> security. A 4th District Court judge in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> on Tuesday provisionally set $ 12,500 bail, Ms. <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON> said. She said a superior court tribunal in <LOCATION> Alejuela </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>, where the trial is being moved, must accept the recommended bail amount. The tribunal will officially set the bail on Monday, Ms. <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>, 69, suffered a heart attack Jan. 24 as he was awaiting a hearing in the capital's <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sebastian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> and was moved to the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. Hospital director <PERSON> Matias </PERSON> <PERSON> Quezada </PERSON> said n Wednesday that <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>'s condition has improved, and he was recuperating in a regular hospital room Ms. <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON> said she asked the court to transfer <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>'s case to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carlos </LOCATION> because that is where the crimes allegedly took place. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> owns a ranch in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chiles </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carlos </LOCATION>, which is about 104 miles north of the capital. A native of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> moved to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> 20 years ago and, according to Ms. <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON>, became a naturalized citizen of the Central American country eight years ago. Ms. <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON> maintains that her client is charged under a drug law passed in 1987 and that the law is not retroactive. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> is charged with actions that allegedly occurred in 1984, she says. Sources in the Office of Judicial Investigations have said <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> was arrested for investigation into charges of drug and weapons trafficking and spying for the Nicaraguan rebels known as Contras. The sources said they acted after residents near <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>'s farm in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chiles </LOCATION> denounced activities by <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>. The acts were seen as possibly endagering releations between <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, they said. Witnesses testifying before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on illegal arms shipments to the Contras said <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>'s ranch was a way station for gun smugglers and cocaine traffickers. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> was not among 13 men indicted in September in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on charges of running an illegal arms network for the Contras. Reports said <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> was granted immunity by the special prosecutor in the case. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> has strongly denied any connection to drug trafficking. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> also was among 29 people named in a civil suit filed last year by two journalists. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Avirgan </PERSON> filed the suit with his wife, <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Honey </PERSON>, after being wounded in a 1984 bombing blamed on the defendants. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> district judge in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> ruled in favor of the defendants, saying the plaintiffs failed to prove their contention that a conspiracy was behind the new conference bombing. Eight people were killed and the apparent target, then-Contra leader <PERSON> Eden </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON>, was wounded.

 A farmworker who claims he was framed in his 1968 conviction for poisoning his seven children has had his case taken up by the governor who called Wednesday for a clemency hearing. `` I am convinced there are still many questions about the <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> case that need answers,'' Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` The interests of justice compel us to seek those answers.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, 53, is challenging his murder conviction on the grounds that new evidence indicates he was framed and someone else has confessed to the killings. His case given to <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state attorney <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> in the 3-month-old investigation because there is conflicting information in the case and she has subpoena power, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said. `` There were seven deaths. We ca n't forget that,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said. `` Seven little ones died and someone was found guilty. If there was a wrongdoing at that time, we would like to know about it. Justice ought to prevail, whatever it may be.'' Three of the six members of the governor's independently elected Cabinet will have to agree with <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>'s request for a clemency hearing before one can be scheduled. The Cabinet and <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, sitting as the board of executive clemency, have the power to pardon <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>. Aides to four of the Cabinet officers said their bosses had not yet been briefed on the case. A fifth, Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON>, was ready to support <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>'s request, an aide said. The sixth did not immediately return telephone calls. The governor's office and the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> have been investigating the matter since October, when the credibility of the 20-year-old case came under scrutiny. In December, <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>'s defense attorneys filed a petition in the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> seeking another trial because of new evidence, and won a Feb. 9 hearing. Defense lawyers <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, contend prosecutors framed <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> and that a neighbor who frequently baby-sat with the children was the killer. Attorneys have said that if a new trial is granted, the passage of time may make it impossible to assemble a credible case, either for the defense or prosecution, because witnesses have died and memories have faded. When <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> and his wife were picking fruit on Oct. 25, 1967, their children, aged 2 to 8, ate a lunch of beans, rice and grits laced with the higly toxic pesticide parathion. The lunch had been prepared ahead of time, but was served by the neighbor at the family's <LOCATION> Arcadia </LOCATION> home. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> is serving a life sentence in <LOCATION> Tomoka </LOCATION> Correctional Institution near <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. He is eligible for parole in 1993. He had been sentenced to death but that was reduced to life in prison when the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> struck down the state's death-penalty statute in the early 1970s Prosecutors said he murdered all seven children, but he was convicted of only one first-degree murder count in May 1968 for the death of his 8-year-old stepdaughter. The petition for a new trial includes claims that evidence was withheld. Also, his attorneys say they have statements from two nursing home employees caring for the former neighbor, 67, that she admitted killing the children.

<HEAD>Foundation Says Peary Notes Provide No Evidence of Faked Claim</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A page of calculations made by Admiral <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> provides no evidence that he faked his claim to have reached the North Pole in 1909, a non-profit navigators group said Wednesday. The findings by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> leave open to scholarly debate whether <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> reached his destination. `` Properly understood, this worksheet says absolutely nothing about whether <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> reached the pole,'' said retired Rear Adm. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, president of the foundation, which was commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> to look into the <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> controversy. `` The paper provides no evidence <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> faked his claim,'' <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> said in a presentation at the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> planetarium _ complete with laser images to highlight the star <PERSON> Betelgeux </PERSON> that he believes <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> used as a guide. <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s claim has had many detractors. One of the most vocal is <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rawlins </PERSON>, an astronomer and historian who grabbed headlines last fall when he concluded that <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> lied about his location and used <PERSON> Betelgeux </PERSON>, a star that would n't have been visible when the sun was up 24 hours a day, to hide the truth. `` Suggesting <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> might not have reached the pole is one thing; declaring him a fraud is another,'' said <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosvenor </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, which helped underwrite <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s 1909 expedition, in attacking <PERSON> Rawlins </PERSON>' contention. After publishing a 1970 article and a 1973 book arguing that <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> was off course, <PERSON> Rawlins </PERSON> went further last October, saying the worksheet unsealed in 1984 showed <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> 121 miles shy of his destination. <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> said three experts determined the calculations likely were made in February 1906 during an earlier Arctic expedition, not April 1909 as written on the envelope in which <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s wife apparently placed them. <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rawlins </PERSON> interpreted one set of numbers as compass readings when they were `` serial numbers of the watch-type chronometers <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> carried with him.'' `` <PERSON> Rawlins </PERSON> assumes that the worksheet shows altitude observations of the sun taken on April 7, 1909, when <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> says that he was at the pole,'' <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> wrote in the foundation's report. `` Rawlins' analysis is clearly incorrect The numbers <PERSON> Rawlins </PERSON> assumes are degrees, minutes and seconds of arc can also be interpreted as hours, minutes and seconds of time,'' he wrote. <PERSON> Rawlins </PERSON> interrupted the meeting to defend himself, calling the <ORGANIZATION> Navigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> report `` a very competent presentation,'' and admitting his error on the chronometer serial numbers. `` In terms of the -LRB- National -RRB- Geographic versus me, this is one for the Geographic,'' he said. However, he maintained that the readings were taken in 1909 and said he has 10 pieces of evidence that <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> did n't make it to the North Pole. <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> said the foundation will review other data and the <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> archive as it continues to evaluate <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s claim. <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON>, a British explorer writing in the September 1988 issue of National Geographic, found that <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> was 30 to 60 nautical miles off course. <PERSON> Rawlins </PERSON> found <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> came no closer than 121 miles from his goal, but because of difficult conditions and low supplies felt pressured to say he had reached the North Pole. Retired Cmdr. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s grandson, defended his grandfather's integrity `` He was accurate. He has always been shown to be where he said he was, when he said he was,'' <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said Wednesday that his defeat in a bid to represent the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> in a new Soviet parliament showed the academy's ruling presidium is not ready for democratic reform. But Pravda, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily, rejected suggestions that undemocratic procedures were used to block <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s nomination. The 67-year-old dean of the Soviet human rights movement again has become a controversial figure in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, but this time he is being both criticized and defended in the state-run press that once either ignored or vilified him. A band of <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s supporters called a meeting for Thursday to protest his Jan. 18 electoral defeat, although he was nominated two days later as a parliamentary candidate from a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> district. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> is among several thousand candidates for the new 2,250-seat <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, a parliamentary body that will be elected in March and which will in turn elect a full-time legislature and a president. There is little doubt President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who proposed creation of the new parliamentary body, will be re-elected head of state. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was quoted in the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Literary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION>, a newspaper popular among Soviet intellectuals, as saying the nominating process in the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> worked well at the lower level, where younger scientists hold sway. But when the leadership made its final picks, he said, only top administrators were picked to represent the prestigious academy in the new parliament, which will have representatives from both geographic districts and from professional, political and social organizations. He charged the leadership failed to fulfill its legal obligations and ignored the popular will in selecting its candidates. Pravda, however, said the meeting at which <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was defeated `` was not only fully democratic but benevolent.'' After his defeat in a bid to represent the academy, he won the overwhelming support of members of his own institute as a candidate for a seat in the district where the academy is located. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> is a physicist who helped develop the Soviet hydrogen bomb and later won a Nobel Peace Prize for his human rights activities. The government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, criticized <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> for suggesting in an interview with the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> newspaper <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON> that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> could be toppled or stymied by Soviet conservatives. It said such statements, unsupported by solid information, cause confusion and uncertainty and can only harm <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms.

<HEAD>Scotland Yard Investigated Claims Hess Was Murdered</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yard </LOCATION> said Wednesday that it investigated claims Nazi war criminal <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> was murdered in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> prison, contrary to the official ruling that he committed suicide. A <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard spokesman, who refused to be identified in keeping with <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> custom, refused to comment on the outcome or any other details of the investigation by its serious crimes squad, made at the request of the Director of Public Prosecutions. `` The <ORGANIZATION> DPP </ORGANIZATION> asked us to investigate suggestions that <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> did not die by his own hand,'' <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard, said in a brief statement. `` A preliminary report has gone to the <ORGANIZATION> DPP </ORGANIZATION> for his decision on whether any further action is needed.'' The statement did not say why <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard, which coordinates national police work, was asked to investigate the possibility of murder. The Director of Public Prosecutions directs the <ORGANIZATION> Crown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prosecution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which handles the prosecution of criminal proceedings begun by police forces. <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>' family believes <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s deputy held by Allied nations in a prison in <LOCATION> Spandau </LOCATION> in the British sector of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, did not commit suicide but was murdered Aug. 17, 1987, at the age of 93. The spokesman said <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard did not investigate a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> doctor's claims that a Hess impostor was murdered in the prison. `` It would appear from this -LRB- <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard -RRB- statement that we accept the premise that he was who he said he was,'' he said. Dr. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, who has written two books on <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, says <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> was murdered while flying to <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> on a peace mission in 1941 and that an impersonator in a second plane was substituted by plotters among <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s deputies. <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> parachuted alone into <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> on May 10, 1941, but concerns about his identity were raised even then. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said he has seen unpublished reports of two autopsies and unpublished photographs of the body in <LOCATION> Spandau </LOCATION> showing marks on the neck inconsistent with a suicide hanging. The autopsies, he said, also supported his contention that the prisoner did not bear scars of a severe chest wound <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> suffered in World War I. He alleges that the prisoner was murdered to stop the leak of details of a World War II plot by powerful Britons to overthrow Prime Minister <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, a surgeon who was a British army doctor when he examined the prisoner in <LOCATION> Spandau </LOCATION> in 1973, first made his claim that the prisoner was not <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> in his 1979 book, `` The Murder of <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>.'' The other book he wrote on the subject, `` Prisoner No. 7,'' was published last year.

 The late surrealist painter <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> left his entire estate to the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> government, the Ministry of Culture said Wednesday. <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> died of heart failure Jan. 23 in his hometown of <PERSON> Figueras </PERSON> at the age of 84.

<TEXT>
 An <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bomb hidden in a drainpipe outside a pub exploded, killing a British soldier and wounding another as the two walked by on patrol, police said Wednesday. The outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which is fighting British rule in the province, claimed in a coded message to news organizations that it was responsible for the Tuesday night attack. The bomb exploded as a joint army-police foot patrol passed the pub Tuesday night in the <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> area, a Roman Catholic enclave and <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> stronghold in west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. Police said infantryman Pvt. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Peacock </PERSON>, 20, who was on his second day of duty in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> when the attack occurred, died early Wednesday while undergoing surgery for wounds to his legs and lower body. The other soldier suffered slight injuries, officials said. <PERSON> Peacock </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> David </PERSON>, who lives in Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s hometown of <PERSON> Grantham </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Lincolnshire </LOCATION>, said: `` It is barbaric that a lad out on peaceful patrol should be blown up like that. But it wo n't alter my position one bit. I still believe the army should stay put. It has my full backing.'' A police spokesman said on condition of anonymity that the bomb was concealed in a drainpipe on the wall of the pub and contained about 2 pounds of explosives `` with a command wire running to an entry at the rear'' of the pub. The predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to oust the British and unite the Protestant-dominated province with the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> under a leftist administration. Later, a bomb attached to a lamppost exploded, injuring one policeman slightly, as police evacuated an area in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> city center, a police spokesman said. Police began clearing an area of <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> after a bomb was thrown over the wall of a police station Wednesday evening. The bomb failed to explode but as police evacuated the area, a second bomb went off, the spokesman said. He said the injured policeman was treated at a local hospital and released. No one claimed responsibility, but two men were being questioned about the bombing, the spokesman said. Also Wednesday evening, a bomb was thrown at a joint police and army patrol in <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION> city center, the spokesman said. Police fired at the bombers but were `` not claiming any hits,'' he said. No one was injured.

 <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-designate <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> accepted thousands of dollars in speaking fees in excess of the limits set by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules and federal law, according to his own financial disclosure statements. In all, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> accepted or agreed to $ 67,350 above what <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules allow, his statements show. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> learned Wednesday that when confronted with the apparent violation, the former congressman from <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, agreed this week to return $ 16,000 in speaking fees and to forgo another $ 39,400 in fees not yet received. He also deferred receipt of an additional $ 12,500 in fees earned in 1988 until 1989 to avoid violating the limits on honoraria congressmen can receive in any one year. The actions brought <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> $ 550 below his 1988 limit. A spokeswoman for <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunette </PERSON>, described the problems as `` just a misunderstanding.'' A key <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> aide said <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> had mistakenly believed that money received after <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> left <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did not apply to House limits. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> filed an amended financial reporting form with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> Ethics this past Monday to reflect the changes. The changes were made without public disclosure by either <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> or the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee until <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> noticed the problem in its review of <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s financial statements. The committee has scheduled a vote to confirm <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, an unsuccessful 1988 Republican presidential candidate, as secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. The staff director for the Democratic-controlled banking committee, <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON>, confronted <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> personally last week with the form showing excess income for 1988. He said <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, who retired from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Jan. 2 after 18 years in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, said he was unaware he had violated the limits on honoraria and cooperated fully. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> was subject to the House rules limiting all outside income, including honoraria, to 30 percent of his $ 89,500 congressional salary _ or $ 26,850. In addition, less restrictive federal statute limits honoraria to 40 percent of congressional salary, or $ 35,800. In his original filing, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> reported receiving $ 119,000 in honoraria for 1988. He also reported giving $ 24,800 of it to charity, which under <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules is not counted against the limit. House rules also limit honoraria _ fees for speeches or similar appearances _ to no more than $ 2,000 per event. In his original filing, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> reported several honoraria well in excess of that $ 2,000 limit. He reported receiving $ 30,000 for two appearances on the television show Firing Line in September and October, and $ 10,000 each for speeches to <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, A.B. <PERSON> Laffer </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. He also reported receiving $ 5,000 from <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assoc </ORGANIZATION>., and $ 2,400 from <ORGANIZATION> Crosby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assoc </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> told him he believed the limits did not apply because he was leaving <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and would not receive the checks until after he was out of office. `` He thought that once the monies were received after he was a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that the limit did n't apply,'' <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON> said. `` Well, clearly the limit does apply, and when it was pointed out to him that it does, he turned around and made the appropriate adjustment.'' As a result, he said, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> agreed to return $ 8,000 each to <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, and to reduce his Firing Line fee to $ 2,000 per appearance, or $ 4,000. He also agreed to reduce the fees for World Trade and <PERSON> Laffer </PERSON> to $ 2,000 each and to forgo altogether the Crosby fee, <PERSON> Brunette </PERSON> said. Because the totals still would exceed the overall House limit on honoraria, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> shifted fees totaling $ 12,500 to 1989 _ when he said he actually received or will receive them, according to both <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON> and Brunette. That gave him a 1988 honoraria total of just over $ 26,000 and within the limit, they said. <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON> said that after consulting with staff of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee he decided <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules permitted honoraria to be counted in the year actually received, even though earned in a different year.

<HEAD>NASA Delays Space Shuttle Launch To Replace Turbopumps</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOWARD BENEDICT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday night it is delaying the launch of Discovery from late February to mid-March to replace three suspect turbopumps whose failure could be fatal to a shuttle and its crew. The announcement came following a high-level meeting of shuttle managers who have debated for several days whether to pull the high-speed turbopumps, which transform liquid oxygen into gas in the spaceship's main engines. Officials said Discovery will be transported to the launch pad early Friday and switching of the pumps will be done there in parallel with other operations. The first pump could be pulled as as early as Sunday. Because of the uncertainty of the availability of new pumps and the length of time to make the replacements, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said it would not set a firm launch date until a flight readiness review in late February. It said the earliest the launch could take place would be in mid-March. The agency had been aiming for a Feb. 23 liftoff, but a series of technical delays not related to the pumps already had delayed that date several days. If the date slips past mid-March, the planned April 28 launch of Atlantis with the Magellan-Venus probe would also have to be delayed, officials said. The three turbopumps became questionable when engineers discovered two tiny cracks in a bearing unit in one of Atlantis' pumps after it completed the second post-Challenger mission in December The engineers believe the cracks were caused by stress corrosion resulting from moisture trapped inside the bearing housing during the manufacturing process. But they are not certain how the moisture penetrated the metal. Officials became concerned when it was learned that two of Discovery's pump bearings had gone through the same manufacturing process as the cracked one. They decided at Wednesday's meeting to remove all three pumps and replace them with new, carefully-inspected units. The turbopumps operate in flight at extremely high speeds, pressures and temperatures, and a failure of one of them could set off a fatal engine explosion. The cracks on Atlantis were too small to cause trouble, but if such cracks widened and split the bearing unit, it could be dangerous, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said. The agency has said the Atlantis mission in April has priority over the launch of Discovery with its communications satellite and that it would scrub the Discovery flight until later in the year if it ca n't get off the pad by about March 15. That's because the Atlantis astronauts have only a 25-day launch window that is favorable for dispatching <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. Earth and <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> will not be in proper alignment again until 1991. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said it could delay the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION> flight a few days, but that's something it would not like to do. It would like to preserve the entire launch window in case of problems. Only one shuttle launch pad is currently available. A second is being refurbished.

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> on Wednesday announced a new government with Moslem fundamentalists retaining two key posts, indicating a continued tough stance against southern Christian and animist rebels. <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Turabi </PERSON>, leader of the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, was named foreign minister and deputy premier, and a member of his party, <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheikh </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaki </PERSON>, justice minister and attorney general, the official <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. The Islamic Front's retention of the foreign and justice portfolios gives it an influential voice in any peace talks with the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> and animist group that opposes Islamic law. Five of the 10 new appointments went to <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Umma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the principal coalition partner, four to the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and one to a southern party. Defense Minister <PERSON> Abdul-Majid </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Umma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> retained his post. The new 24-member coalition comprises 11 <ORGANIZATION> Umma </ORGANIZATION> ministers, seven from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, five from small southern parties and one from the <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of western <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, the news agency said. <PERSON> Turabi </PERSON>, who was justice minister and acting foreign minister, was among seven ministers whose resignations were accepted Tuesday by <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s five-member <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which acts as a collective presidency. It is <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>'s fourth government since he became the first elected leader in 16 years in April 1986. The military ousted longtime strongman <PERSON> Gaafar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON> a year earlier. The lingering civil war in the south, famine and drought, then floods, have destablilized the country. Sudanese staged strikes and demonstrations in December to protest government price increases. The latest shakeup was prompted when the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the second-largest in the <ORGANIZATION> Constituent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, quit the coalition last month. The party signed a peace accord in November with rebel leader <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garang </PERSON>, a renegade army colonel. The agreement's provisions included suspension of Islamic law during peace negotiations. <PERSON> Turabi </PERSON>, the premier's brother-in-law, has been at the center of debate over the tentative peace agreement and controversy over the fate of Islamic law, or <LOCATION> Sharia </LOCATION>, which <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON> decreed in September 1983. <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> has spoken of possible amendments to Islamic law, and this would give the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, still held by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a key drafting role.

<HEAD>Jailed Attacker Urges Iran To Insist On Release In Hostage Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Lebanese imprisoned for trying to kill of a former Iranian prime minister urged <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Wednesday to insist on his release, implying that a pardon was part of the deal that led to freedom for three French hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The French government last year denied widespread reports that it won the hostages' release in part by agreeing to pardon <PERSON> Anis </PERSON> <PERSON> Naccache </PERSON>, who led four other pro-Iranian attackers in a failed attempt to kill <PERSON> Shapour </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakhtiar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s last prime minister before the Islamic Revolution. <PERSON> Naccache </PERSON>'s appeal was made in a statement issued late Wednesday night by his lawyer <PERSON> Antoine </PERSON> <PERSON> Comte </PERSON>. French Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> plans to go to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Sunday for the first high-level visit since diplomatic relations were restored last year as part of the hostage deal. `` I ask the Iranian government, which guaranteed the accord between <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the parties concerned during the liberation of the hostages, to remind <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> of its engagements,'' the statement said. `` It is inadmissible to say that relations between the two countries are good while five soldiers of Islam are still in French prisons.'' <PERSON> Naccache </PERSON> and three other men were sentenced to life in prison for the July 1980 assault on <PERSON> Bakhtiar </PERSON>, which left a bystander and a policeman dead and three other police officers wounded. The fifth member of <PERSON> Naccache </PERSON>'s team got a 20-year-sentence. <PERSON> Bakhtiar </PERSON>, who lives in exile in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, was not hurt. French authorities believed that <PERSON> Naccache </PERSON>'s orders to assassinate the former prime minister came from senior Iranian officials. While <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> was seeking to win freedom for its hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said publicly that he would be willing to pardon <PERSON> Naccache </PERSON>, but only as part of a deal in which all French hostages were freed. Last May, when journalist <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> and diplomats <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Carton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> were released by their pro-Iranian captors in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and then-Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> denied that <PERSON> Naccache </PERSON>'s release was part of the deal. <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON>, Carton and <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> were held by a group called Islamic Jihad, which is still holding some of the 15 Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The longest held is <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985. Reports that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> made important concessions to get its hostages back drew criticism, especially in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, on the grounds that such deals could make it more difficult to win freedom for other hostages without making similar bargains. French officials insisted they agreed only to restore good relations and to repay a $ 1 billion loan originally made by the shah of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for a uranium enrichment plant, and frozen after the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s Islamic revolution.

 Two men accused of detonating a remote-control bomb that seriously wounded a sheriff were to be paid $ 20,000 for killing him, according to a federal document unsealed Wednesday. The six-page federal complaint was made public one day after <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> McClendon </PERSON>, 42, of Slaughter and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tullier </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amant </LOCATION> were arrested in connection with the Dec. 15 bombing. Lafourche Parish Sheriff <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON> nearly died from shock and blood loss when his foot was nearly severed in the blast, doctors say. One of his deputies was also injured. `` A few days before Christmas, <PERSON> McClendon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tullier </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> to get paid for the bombing. They returned to <PERSON> McClendon </PERSON>'s barn with $ 8,000 cash. They were to receive an additional $ 12,000 for a total of $ 20,000 for the completed job,'' the complaint said. The information was provided by an unidentified source who knew both men and had talked with them about the bombing, according to an affidavit that was part of the complaint. The document does not say who wanted <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON> dead or why. More arrests are expected, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, special agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. The source cited in the complaint said <PERSON> McClendon </PERSON> claimed to have placed the bomb in a paper bag next to the sheriff's car. <PERSON> McClendon </PERSON> said he set off the bomb after he saw <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON> approach the bag and kick it, the affidavit said. The complaint said <ORGANIZATION> BATF </ORGANIZATION> experts in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> determined that the bomb was a wooden box encasing two pipes loaded with explosives, nails and bullets. It appeared to have been detonated by a model airplane remote control device. According to federal agents, <PERSON> McClendon </PERSON> is a former police officer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>. He also held a <ORGANIZATION> Lafourche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> commission and was involved with a drug task force in the parish in the early 1970s. <PERSON> Tullier </PERSON> was described as an unemployed instrument fitter. In a brief hearing in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> Wednesday, a magistrate ordered the two men sent to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> for a bond hearing to be held in the next 10 days. If convicted on bombing and conspiracy charges, each man could get up to 25 years in prison and a $ 25,000 fine, said <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> agent. <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>, 60, and Deputy <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Leche </PERSON>, 62, were injured as they left a Christmas party for senior citizens at a civic center. Doctors were able to reconnect <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>'s foot and predicted he would regain 90 percent use of it within a year. He was discharged from the hospital last month. Leche was released after two days in the hospital. In addition to the federal charges, <LOCATION> Lafourche </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION> prosecutors Wednesday charged the men with two counts each of attempted murder. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamonica </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Baton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> said the federal charges would be addressed first.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials on Wednesday defended the agency's restrictions on blind persons who apply to become diplomats, but the officials who spoke at a congressional hearing were treated derisively by an audience overwhelmingly composed of sightless persons. Under State Department policy, the blind may apply to become foreign service officers but, in a policy change that became effective late last year, they can not use braille or receive help from readers when taking entrance examinations. More than 100 blind persons crowded into the hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> civil service subcommittee and made clear through occasional snickers and groans their displeasure with two <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> witnesses sent to explain the agency's position. Much of the hearing focussed on the case of <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabby </PERSON>, who has been trying unsuccessfully since 1985 to become a career diplomat and who testified that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s treatment of him reflects either `` sheer ignorance or deliberate deception.'' <PERSON> Rabby </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and has passed five <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> entrance examinations, is a graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> with degrees in Spanish and French and has a master's degree in business administration from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> He lived for 15 years in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and speaks in the cultured tones of a man accustomed to intellectual pursuits. He has his own consulting business, helping disabled people find employment. <PERSON> Rabby </PERSON>, 46, rejected the suggestion that gestures such as winks and nods form part of the overall message a diplomat must assimilate and that therefore the profession is not suitable for a blind person. `` No international treaty has ever been decided on the basis of a wink or a nod.'' he said. Subcommittee Chairman <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON>, D-Minn., criticized the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> policy and the agency's decision to impose strict limits on the degree to which the two department witnesses could respond to questions The witnesses were <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stout </PERSON>, a director in the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> personnel office, and <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Yuspeh </PERSON>, coordinator of the handicapped employment program. Stout said it is difficult for the foreign service to accommodate blind persons because of the problem they have in working independently from official documents and the requirement that all career diplomats be available to serve worldwide on short notice, including countries which have unfamiliar settings and cultures. <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON>'s position is that federal law requires all government and government-assisted agencies to conduct employment practices without discrimination on the basis of handicap. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should consider withholding <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> appropriations if the agency does not demonstrate a more flexible attitude toward blind applicants.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, offering `` a thousand apologies for the way I sound,'' canceled one speech and drastically shortened another Wednesday as he continued to battle a bad case of laryngitis. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has had a cold for about a week and whose voice has been steadily deteriorating, canceled a speech before the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> at a downtown hotel. Later in the day, he lasted less than a minute in an appearance before a business group at the Executive Office Building next to the White House before turning the microphone over to Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, who continued the speech in his behalf. White House deputy press secretary <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> backed out of the first speech because `` it was advisable that he rest his voice at this time.'' But in the evening, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was well enough to host a a reception for more than 400 diplomatic heads of mission, standing for more than an hour in a lengthy receiving line and then mingling briefly with the guests. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters he was feeling much better after having taken antibiotics for an ear condition, and was now only suffering from a hoarse voice. `` It's nice,'' said his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>. `` He does n't yell around the house.'' Hoarse voice aside, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was animated in his brief appearance before the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wholesaler-Distributors </ORGANIZATION>. `` Thank you all very much for being here and a thousand apologies for the way I sound,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanners </PERSON>, chairman of the organization, told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: `` Do n't worry about it We've learned to read your lips.'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, delivering <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech, appealed to the organization to help rally support within the business community for the yet-to-be-announced deficit reduction proposals that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will outline to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 9.

 Heard the one about the two-headed snake that could n't agree on which head got to eat dinner? It's no joke, if you're talking about the two-headed black rat snake named `` IM'' -LRB- for `` instinct'' and `` mind'' -RRB- that has been under observation at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennessse </ORGANIZATION> here since shortly after its birth 12 years ago. `` If one head gets a good grip on the head of the mouse and the other gets a good grip on the tail, they can fight for hours unless you stop them,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Burghardt </PERSON>, who teaches psychology and zoology at the university. `` They're simply fighting for the privilege of swallowing the mouse,'' he said Wednesday. The prey in their twice-monthly meals, he noted, ends up in the common stomach. IM is showing researchers whether over time animals can learn to share, he said. `` We found the left head ate more prey, but it was smaller. And the right head ate fewer prey which tended to be larger,'' he said. `` Over five years, the weight of the prey eaten was identical -LRB- for both heads -RRB-. So the animals were in some sense splitting the resource. We did n't expect that,'' he said. The university got IM from nearby <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laboratory </LOCATION>, where two boys found the animal in their family's garden. Back then, the two heads `` really had two separate identities,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, a research engineer and amateur herpetologist at the Oak Ridge lab. `` If one wanted to eat, it would try to keep the food from the other.'' <PERSON> Burghardt </PERSON> said the animal also is providing clues on theories of motivation and cognition. `` We can test out some ideas in motivational psychology that we normally could n't, such as, why do you stop eating?'' he said. `` One is, do you stop eating when your stomach is distended? Or is the amount you eat determined by the effort in chewing and swallowing? `` We're still analyzing at this point, but the indication is that the animal -LRB- IM's left head or right head -RRB- that swallows is somewhat less responsive afterward than the one that has n't. That suggests that the act of eating plays some role on the regulation of food intake.''

 Most Western and neutral diplomats in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> believe President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government will fall by July without Soviet military support, the senior envoy from the closed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> said Wednesday. `` There's no support there'' among the people, <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glassman </PERSON> told a news conference the day after the last 11 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> staff members left the Afghan capital. `` The regime in many senses is like a building without its girders,'' said <PERSON> Glassman </PERSON>, who was charge d'affaires at the embassy for the last 18 months. `` I think there's a general consensus among most informed observers that the life of the regime is likely to be short.'' In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s top diplomat to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> contended that government forces have been stockpiling arms to defeat the insurgents. `` <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> will use arms it has so far refrained from using,'' Afghan Charge d'Affaires <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarwar </PERSON> told a news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>. He would not elaborate. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which sent troops to its southern neighbor nine years ago to prop up a teetering Marxist client government, is in the final stages of withdrawing troops who numbered 115,000 a year ago. Only about 15,000 Soviet soldiers remain in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, according to Western and Soviet diplomats. They are to be gone by Feb. 15 under a U.N.-sponsored accord. When asked how long <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s forces can hold out against Moslem guerrillas in the snow-covered mountains surrounding <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Glassman </PERSON> said: `` This is a work for a crystal ball.'' But he added: `` In <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, most of the Western and neutral diplomats are betting between now and July.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> closed its embassy on Monday, citing fears that security will deteriorate because of the Soviet departure. The West German Embassy shut down Saturday. Several others are expected to follow suit within a few days and others have sharply reduced the size of their stafs. <PERSON> Sarwar </PERSON> said countries that have shut their missions in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> had not been in danger. `` We believe they are leaving as part of psychological warfare waged against the Afghan people for the last 10 years,'' he said. `` These countries may really wish to turn <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> ... into a land of rubble.'' <PERSON> Glassman </PERSON> rejected those accusations, made previously by other Afghan government officials. `` I think the evolution of events are foreordained already by 10 years of war, 10 years of foreign intervention and the people's objection to that.'' He said anyone looking for `` physical existence'' that <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government is faltering need only look to the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s food and fuel lifeline to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s fertile northern The road can easily be blocked by the guerrillas, he said. On Jan. 23, Soviet and Afghan government forces launched what the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> described as a `` scorched earth'' policy on villages along the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>, the only land route for Soviet troops leaving <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Diplomatic and guerrilla sources said hundreds of Afghan villagers died in the coordinated campaign of bombing raids, artillery attacks, missiles and ground assaults. <PERSON> Sarwar </PERSON> said the battle with the guerrilla forces of rebel commander <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Masoud </PERSON> followed a refusal by <PERSON> Masoud </PERSON> to keep the highway open. `` It has proved to our people who our real friends are,'' <PERSON> Sarwar </PERSON> said of the battle. `` Our friendship with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will continue on a much warmer and wider scale,'' he added.

 The Princess of <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> swept into the Big Apple Wednesday on her first official visit here, and her presence sent New Yorkers, who rarely swoon over celebrities, into a royal dither. `` It was marvelous, quite dramatic,'' she said, when asked about her first impressions of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> at an evening reception. The 27-year-old princess arrived on a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> supersonic Concorde at <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> at 5:49 p.m. for a three-day visit that will show her both ends of the city's social spectrum, the poor as well as the rich. Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> stepped off the plane at 6 p.m., wearing a bright blue coat trimmed with black fur cuffs and matching black accessories. She greeted about 30 dignitaries waiting to meet her on the airport tarmac. She was immediately driven to an evening party sponsored by producers of Scottish cashmere. Among the guests at the reception and buffet on the 50th floor of a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> office tower were Oscar de la Renta and <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Karan </PERSON>, who design apparel for the company. `` She has extraordinary looks, and when you have extraordinary looks you can wear anything,'' said de la Renta. `` With time, she will be one of the great well-dressed ladies of the world.'' `` She's special! She's royalty!,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON>, chief executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION> B. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Altman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> department store. `` You know we do n't have royalty in this country. The closest thing we have here are movie stars and rock stars.'' Also attending were <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s Chairman <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Traub </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Neimark </PERSON>, the chairman and chief executive officer of the <PERSON> Bergdorf </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> department store. <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> wore a two-piece outfit designed by British designer <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, a gathered blue satin tunic over a black wool skirt with black accessories and a pearl necklace and earrings. Before the princess arrived, British Consul <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Finlayson </PERSON> instructed the the guests on royal etiquette. `` For British subjects it's protocol for the men to nod and the women can curtsy. For Americans, ever since the War of Independence, you can do what you want,'' he said, eliciting laughter among the 150 to 200 people present. During her visit, <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> also will hobnob with socialite <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> <PERSON> Astor </PERSON>, developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, actor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, publisher <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> and others of the rich-and-famous class. Lesser mortals were preparing for the visit by snapping up street vendors' Very Important Princess T-shirts, <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jacks </ORGANIZATION> and other commemorative items. But all will not be black tie receptions for the 27-year-old princess, said <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Grainger </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>, who is traveling without husband Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> or children <PERSON> William </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>, will visit a day-care center and shelter for the homeless on <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s Lower East Side on Thursday. Later that day she'll talk about British-made toys, food, gifts and children's clothing at F.A.O. <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON>, the city's topmost toy store. Thursday night, she will see a production of `` Falstaff' at the <ORGANIZATION> Welsh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION>'s American debut at the <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION>, followed by a black-tie gala that 850 of the city's beautiful people have paid $ 1,000 apiece to attend. On Friday, after visiting <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> to meet with children suffering from AIDS, the princess returns to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Not everyone is thrilled with the royal visit. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> comptroller and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, called the princess a symbol of the crown `` and its tyranny.'' He said 500 people would demonstrate outside the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> theater during the performance to protest <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s involvement in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> personnel used numbered flags Wednesday to map a wreckage-strewn area where a fuel-laden tanker crashed, but the investigation may be hampered by the lack of a flight data recorder and the apparent loss of many maintenance records. All 19 people aboard the KC-135A Stratotanker died when it crashed on takeoff about a half-mile south of a <ORGANIZATION> Dyess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> runway Tuesday. The KC-135A tanker, based at K.I. <ORGANIZATION> Sawyer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, stopped at <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION> en route to a training mission. It was scheduled to refuel some F-16s in the air before flying to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and then Guam. The plane was was carrying military members and their dependents, as well as 30,000 gallons of jet fuel, officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> workers Wednesday used stakes and red flags to map out about 2 square miles of scorched grassland and woods around the crash site, said Master Sgt. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Dostal </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION> spokesman. `` Once it's staked out, it can snow and these flags have numbers. They can still see where things are,'' <PERSON> Dostal </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION> justice of the peace who spent Tuesday at the site to record deaths, said the plane was in many pieces, the largest of them the tail section. There were `` a bunch of small pieces everywhere,'' <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> said. `` There's a few big sections, 10 to 12 feet long. There's a big wing, pretty badly burned.'' The last two bodies were found Tuesday evening. On Wednesday, the bodies were taken to the <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION> base hospital and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> released the victims' names. The flight manifest showed 17 passengers from <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, and two from <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dostal </PERSON> said. Seven were crew members, four were active duty military members, four were retired military, and four were dependents, including a boy about 7, he said. Officials said servicemen and women, retirees and dependants are allowed to take routine flights if space is available. Members of the Air Force Accident Investigation Board began arriving at <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION> late Wednesday. Their investigation could be hampered by the fact that no flight data recorder or cockpit voice recorder was aboard the modified <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707, said 1st Lt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ames </PERSON>, deputy chief of public affairs at <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION>. Tech Sgt. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dockery </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, said the recorders are not deemed necessary on flights such as the tanker's training mission. Few military aircraft carry the recorders, especially older planes such as the tanker, <PERSON> Dockery </PERSON> said. Flight recorders, known as black boxes, were n't in use 26 years ago when the plane was built. He said the conversation between the plane and the <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION> traffic control tower had been recorded at the tower and would be turned over to investigators. Officials at <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> said the plane's maintenance files were aboard before it crashed, and their loss also could handicap the investigation. `` It's fairly common to carry maintenance records on the aircraft when its going to be deployed for an extensive period of time, in this case, approximately six weeks. Some of those are duplicated, but not all. So the board will have a little harder time because those records were being carried -LRB- on the plane -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> spokesman Capt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bicking </PERSON> said. One witness to the crash, <PERSON> Skeet </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, said the plane never got more than about 60 feet off the ground, but <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials refused to speculate on what might have caused the disaster. `` That left wing hit the ground and -LRB- crashed -RRB- just like these pictures of atomic bombs you've seen,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` The engines were backfiring or popping. He -LRB- the pilot -RRB- made a sharp turn ... and crashed.'' Maj. <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Randle </PERSON>, spokeswoman at <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, said the KC-135A could fly if one of its four engines was out. Its ability to fly with even less power would depend on a number of factors including weight, temperature, pressure and altitude, Ms. <PERSON> Randle </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said the plane that crashed had been in service since 1963 and was still carrying its original <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Whitney engines. The KC-135 is the backbone of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> tanker fleet, which has about 500 of them averaging 29 years of Military officials said the plane that crashed was carrying about 155,000 pounds of fuel. The KC-135A has a capacity of 187,000 pounds.

<HEAD>Three Former DEA Agents Charged With Drug Dealing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three former <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agents, one of whom remains a fugitive, were charged Wednesday with dealing in large quantities of cocaine and heroin and stealing drugs from the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> vault. The ex-agents previously had been charged with conspiring to launder more than $ 600,000 through Swiss banks. That money was believed connected to drug trafficking, but no drug charges had been filed previously. Also Wednesday federal authorities posted a $ 20,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of former agent <PERSON> Darnell </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, 41, of <PERSON> Palos </PERSON> <PERSON> Verdes </PERSON>, who has been on the run since two other agents were arrested Nov. 22. Those agents, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 39, of <LOCATION> Claremont </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Countryman </PERSON>, 45, of Walnut pleaded innocent Dec. 19 to money-laundering conspiracy and tax evasion charges. They face trial later this year, and may be arraigned on the new charges Thursday. The new, 32-count indictment charges the three with dealing in kilograms of heroin and `` hundreds of kilograms'' of cocaine. It accuses <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> of stealing heroin from the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> vault Oct. 5, 1984 and <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> of taking 3 pounds of heroin from the vault Jan. 30, 1985. They also are accused of working with known drug dealers <PERSON> Mahlon </PERSON> <PERSON> Steward </PERSON> and <PERSON> Conway </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Waddy </PERSON>. The Waddys, associated with jailed drug kingpin <PERSON> Elrader </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, allegedly were hidden by <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for three days in June 1987 in an apartment rented by the former agents. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> is charged with alerting <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Waddy </PERSON> later in June 1987 that he might soon be arrested. Prosecutors have said <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> also is suspected to alerting <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>, who last year was convicted of running a California-to-Michigan cocaine and heroin ring. An arrest warrant also was issued Wednesday for a man named <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lair </PERSON>, charged in the indictment with helping the agents distribute drugs in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and elsewhere. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the wife of the accused former agent, also is charged in the indictment with helping her husband launder money through Swiss banks. She was to be summoned to court without arrest. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, who investigators thought had fled to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, was seen in early January in suburban <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, posing as an agent on a stakeout. In another incident, he apparently used an assumed name and posed as a <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agent to ask <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police officers to help him search for a man. They consented, but no one was found. The previous seven-count indictment, issued Dec. 7, charged the ex-agents with hiding unreported income by transferring large amounts of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> between 1984 and 1987. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>'s girlfriend, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON>, 33, has been charged with lying to a federal grand jury when she said she had no knowledge that <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> maintained overseas bank accounts. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, an agent from 1972 until his resignation in 1987, has been held without bail, while Countryman, an agent from 1977 until being granted disability retirement in 1986, is free on $ 120,000 bail. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> was an agent from 1978 until resigning in August 1987.

<TEXT>
 The leftist government reported Honduran troops attacked a border post Wednesday. Officials extended a unilateral cease-fire with U.S.-backed rebels and allowed two radio news programs to return to the air. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Honduran troops used mortar, rocket and rifle fire to attack a Nicaraguan army border post at <LOCATION> Aguas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Calientes </LOCATION> in the northern province of <LOCATION> Nuevo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Segovia </LOCATION>. A ministry statement did not say if there were casualties. Nicaraguan troops obeyed standing orders not to return fire, a ministry spokesman said on condition of anonymity. The Honduran government had no immediate reaction. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s office said Tuesday the one-month truce extension is intended `` to make it easier for counterrevolutionary groups to put down their weapons, accept amnesty and join the normal life'' of the country. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government and rebels, known as Contras, agreed on a temporary cease-fire in March 1988. Since the failure in June of talks to convert the agreement into a permanent truce, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have declared unilateral cease-fires. Each side accuses the other of violations. The last clash was Jan. 28, when a youth and two children were killed in <LOCATION> Chontales </LOCATION> province, about 125 miles east of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said they were caught in the crossfire. The peace talks were held as part of an agreement <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and four other Central American countries signed in August 1987. Its provisions include greater democracy, amnesties, a ban on use of territory of one country by rebels of another and internal reconciliations. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said it had authorized two radio newscasts to return to the air Wednesday. The government canceled the Radio Mundial newscast Oct. 13 for allegedly carrying out `` a defamatory campaign against the government.'' A program on Radio Corporacion was canceled Oct. 31 for allegedly broadcasting false information critical of the government.

 Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and his Chinese counterpart <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON> began talks Thursday on a summit aimed at healing the 30-year breach between <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` I would now like to warmly and formally welcome you,'' <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> said in opening remarks at the Great Hall of the People. After arriving Wednesday, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said in a written statement in English distributed by the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, `` We have stepped on the soil of the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> full of good expectations and great hopes.'' He said he hoped to finalize preparations for a meeting between Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, and set an exact date with the Chinese. Both sides have indicated they want their leaders to meet in the first half of the year. `` We are convinced that the summit will open a new chapter in the history of two neighboring countries,'' said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s statement He arrived on a special plane of the Soviet airline <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s old airport, now used only by top Chinese and foreign leaders. He was met by <PERSON> Qian </PERSON>. The two men shook hands warmly as they stood bareheaded in a biting wind. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> did not read his statement, but he told reporters he was carrying a letter from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to Chinese leaders. He did not reveal the contents. `` I reached an agreement in principle with my comrade <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'' on holding a summit, he said. `` Now we're going to talk concretely about the matter.'' <PERSON> Qian </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in December was a `` major step forward,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said in his statement. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> will fly to <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> on Friday for a meeting the following day with <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>. The Chinese leader is in the east coast city to celebrate the upcoming Lunar New Year. `` We are starting our negotiations fully aware of the scale of the forthcoming event,'' said the Soviet minister. `` The title theme of the Soviet-Chinese dialogue is peace and development.'' The Soviets have been courting <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for several years to heal their longstanding ideological and political quarrel, but only in the past year has <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> shown equal eagerness. This has been prompted by changed Soviet policies and a sense that not much time remains for <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, who is 84. <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s 10-year occupation by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> still is the chief regional conflict at issue. But <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, under apparent pressure from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, its main ally, said last month it is willing to pull out by September. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> agreed in principle to end its aid to Cambodian rebels by then. Two other issues that blocked Chinese-Soviet reconciliation also appear nearing resolution. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is scheduled to complete its troop pullout from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in two weeks and has announced plans to withdraw some troops from <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>, its ally on the Chinese border. The last Soviet foreign minister to visit <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> was <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, who accompanied <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> in 1959. The next year the two countries split bitterly over leadership of the world communist movement and a border dispute.

 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, arriving Wednesday on his first visit to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, discussed anti-drug efforts with <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s president, declared staunch <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> opposition to any Latin `` debtor cartel'' and got a birthday serenade from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy workers. The vice president arrived a day before inaugural ceremonies for <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s new president, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. His first of several scheduled bilateral sessions was with <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> mostly listened as <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> talked about how much <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> is doing to combat drugs and guerrillas, `` and how much help they need from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> congratulated Barco on `` those courageous steps'' but pointed out that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> resources to help out are limited. Following the meeting, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> commented, `` We had a very good discussion. ... I've got a very good feel'' for the Colombians' views Later <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, and was to meet with outgoing president <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Lusinchi </PERSON> before attending a reception for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Venezuelan business leaders at the residence of Ambassador <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters he viewed his trip, the first foreign diplomatic mission for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s first visit to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, as a chance to meet with foreign leaders, `` to eyeball them, to get a feel where they're coming from on some of these sensitive issues.'' Later, addressing about 200 employees at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, he said he had come `` to show the interest of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration that we have in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and to show our enthusiasm for the development of democracy in Central and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>.'' The embassy workers presented him with a birthday cake decorated with a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag and also a cupcake that they said symbolized the tight federal budget at home. They sang happy birthday to the vice president, who turns 42 on Saturday. Entering the busy capital by motorcade, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> created a cacophony of horn-honking when he decided to stop and buy some bananas, guavas and mangoes at a small corner fruit market. `` Stimulating the economy already,'' he joked to reporters as he left the market, having bought two bags of fruit. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said on arrival that his primary mission was to be `` a cheerleader for democracy.'' But the massive debts owed by <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and other Latin countries was expected to dominate much of the discussion among some two dozen heads of state attending the inauguration. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> indicated the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is maintaining a hard line on so-called debtor cartel movements to form a unified organization of Third World nations that face huge national debts. Speaking to reporters aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Two just before landing in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said such ideas are `` counterproductive.'' `` We're absolutely opposed to the idea of a debtor's cartel,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` Our strong position is that a debtor cartel is a non-starter.'' <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s new president, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, has indicated he will take a leadership role on the Latin debt issue and has rejected a coordinated effort in which the Latin countries would deal with their creditors. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s debt is about $ 30.3 billion. On Dec. 31 the country joined many other debtor governments and suspended payments on the principal of most of that debt. Latin American countries owe more than $ 440 billion combined. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said that during his talks with <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> and other leaders the debt issue would certainly come up and he would voice <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> opposition to any cartel efforts. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters that he was n't bringing `` a new initiative from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' on the debt issue. `` I will be there to listen to their concerns.'' He said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is willing to hear suggestions by the Latin leaders about how to solve the debt question. After their meeting, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said they discussed the debt situation, but gave no specifics. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> called the talk `` frank and candid,'' saying, `` I'm much more informed and I appreciate the meeting.'' They said the subject of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> also came up. Perez, who supported the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> in their 1979 overthrow of Nicaraguan dictator <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>, has indicated he wants to take a leadership role in helping to resolve the <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s current strife and further the regional peace efforts spearheaded by Costa Rican president <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>. A source close to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had a lively discussion during which they agreed to disagree on the debt question, but agreed on the need work for democracy in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s national security adviser, <PERSON> Carnes </PERSON> <PERSON> Lord </PERSON>, said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is not rejecting any coordinated effort by the Latin Americans to address their creditors. The administration would balk at formation of an organization that would amount to a cartel, but might be open to suggestions on other kinds of multilateral meetings.

 By the time he was 25, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> was an American success story, a poor black kid from <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> who earned degrees from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, clerked for a federal judge and landed a job with a big <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> law firm. At 28, he was a story of another kind _ a homeless <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leaguer </ORGANIZATION> wandering the streets of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, dressed in rags, fishing through trash cans. Finally, friends and former classmates hunted him down and convinced him to enter a counseling facility. Three years later, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s story lacks a neat ending. At 31, he is neither back on the fast track nor back on the street. After living for several years in an apartment provided by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a mental health rehabilitation agency, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> moved back to his mother's home in <LOCATION> Phenix </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala </LOCATION>. He spent two months working as a part-time law clerk, but says he has no immediate plans to try to resume his career. In a telephone interview, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said he was `` pretty much just trying to get used to being around here again.'' `` Getting to see home again is nice,'' he said. `` It's quiet down here. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> can be kind of a wild place.'' It was a wild place for <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, who arrived in spring 1985. Soon after that his money ran out, but exactly what drove him onto the street remains unclear; although he appears to have been depressed, he has described the period as a sort of urban camping experience. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s problems seem to have begun in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, where he lost his $ 42,000-a-year job after twice flunking the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> bar exam. He moved in with some relatives in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, and began a job search. When things did n't work out <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> headed to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where he had attended law school. After friends who had spotted him on the street obtained a court order for his apprehension, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> agreed to accept room and counseling from The Bridge. For a month, the homeless lawyer was news. Homeless advocates said his case showed the breadth of the problem; people who learned of his plight offered money or jobs, although <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> clearly was in no condition to take advantage of the latter. Since returning to <LOCATION> Phenix </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, his only job has been a brief stint in the office of attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellamy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bellamy </PERSON> identified with <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> when he read about him in the newspaper three years ago; he, too, had flunked the bar exam the first time he took it. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, he said, `` did an excellent job. ... I gave him a brief to do, and it was apparent he was real smart.'' But <PERSON> Bellamy </PERSON> said he could not afford to keep a clerk; <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> himself said the work there was `` not the best use for my type of law background.'' He said he might take the bar exam again and try to get a job with a small law firm or a public interest organization, preferably in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> or another large city. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> still does n't readily admit to having had a psychological problem. Asked about his time on the street, he calls it `` an odd situation. ... I was just trying to deal with a tough situation. ... I've always been kind of a self-sufficient person.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, a homeless advocate who helped link <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> up with The Bridge, said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> `` always felt above everything there.'' In <LOCATION> Phenix </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, he has rebuffed suggestions that he seek counseling. <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> says this is not remarkable; many homeless people must struggle to regain their equilibrium. But in another respect, he said, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> is unusual: `` He got help.''

<DATELINE>PALERMO, Sicily (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A year after gaining the convictions of 338 mobsters in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s so-called `` maxitrial,'' a government drive against the <ORGANIZATION> Mafia </ORGANIZATION> has lost momentum. Since those verdicts, the Mafia seems to have moved a step or more ahead of the state as the mob schemes to safeguard its interests, which include billion-dollar international drug trafficking and control of lucrative public contracts in developing southern <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Investigators also suspect the king of the Corleone crime family _ there actually is one _ comes and goes as he pleases in <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>'s capital and largest city. The last photograph investigators have of the Corleone leader, <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Riina </PERSON>, is 30 years old, and for all they know, the man believed to be the most powerful Mafioso in <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION> today, probably has had plastic surgery to change his looks. <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Di </PERSON> <PERSON> Pisa </PERSON>, the chief anti-Mafia prosecutor, notes that the Sicilians' fear of Mafia revenge and their mistrust of the state make it unlikely an ordinary citizen would turn <PERSON> Riina </PERSON> in. The Corleone family gets its name from a Sicilian town. The American author <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Puzo </PERSON> used that name for the main character in his novel `` The Godfather'' and it was used as well in Godfather movies. While the <PERSON> Corleone </PERSON> clan has its roots in the town, its power base is believed to have shifted to <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION>. The claim that <PERSON> Riina </PERSON> moves boldly and openly in parts of <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION> was made on state television recently by <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> `` Totuccio'' Contorno, a Mafioso-turned-informer. His testimony helped convict the 338 defendants, many of them top mob bosses, on murder, drug and other charges in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s largest-ever case against the mob. The interview was made in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> where Contorno lives under a secret identity provided by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities after he testified for them. Italian investigators ruefully acknowledge that the state of the anti-Mafia front in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> is so dismal that <PERSON> Contorno </PERSON>'s claim may well be true. Among the setbacks in the past year in the war against the mob: _ The slaying of Judge <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Saetta </PERSON>, who had been assigned to hear the appeals of the maxitrial this year The Mafia this decade has assassinated several investigating magistrates but until <PERSON> Saetta </PERSON> was killed the mob left presiding judges alone. _ A court ruling that prosecutors ca n't automatically try mob suspects in one mass trial on the sole basis that the Mafia is directed by a Palermo-based `` commission,'' which the state did in the maxitrial Prosecutors say the ruling weakens their ability to present stronger, more comprehensive cases that are more likely to hurt big-time mob bosses. For many prosecutors and police officials, the appointment of <PERSON> Domenico </PERSON> <PERSON> Sica </PERSON> as the high commissioner against the <ORGANIZATION> Mafia </ORGANIZATION> was virtually the only bright spot. <PERSON> Sica </PERSON> earned national fame as a prosecutor assigned top domestic and international terrorist cases. But <PERSON> Sica </PERSON>, in a speech in January summing up his first six months as <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s top anti-Mafia fighter, complained that he needs more experienced consultants and said the quality of information from a special intelligence unit at his disposal was unsatisfactory. `` We ca n't provide a detailed picture of the Mafia today,'' said <PERSON> Guido </PERSON> <PERSON> Lo </PERSON> <PERSON> Forte </PERSON>, an investigating magistrate, in a recent interview in <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION>'s Palace of Justice. He said the mob now appears to be circulating less and less important information within its ranks one way of eliminating the risk of witnesses. At the same time, the lack of a government witness protection program discourages potential informants. Two of informant Contorno's brothers-in-law were killed by the mob in <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION> in recent months. What investigators would especially like to know is new Mafia strategies for avoiding tightened financial checks. `` Iron Tower,'' a joint U.S.-Italian investigation, disclosed in December that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cocaine was being sent to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> in exchange for heroin, some of it shipped in liquified form in wine bottles. According to investigators, such bartering avoids incriminating bank records. Authorities say the Sicilian mob's share of worldwide drug trade has declined in the past few years. One reason is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Italian prosecution; the other is competition from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Asian crime syndicates. `` The biggest chunk of Mafia earnings today comes from political corruption and public contracts,'' says <PERSON> Pino </PERSON> <PERSON> Arlacchi </PERSON>, a sociologist who studies organized crime. Laws were enacted in the early 1980s requiring those bidding for public contracts to prove they had no Mafia links, but <PERSON> Lo </PERSON> <PERSON> Forte </PERSON> says the mob got around the restrictions in some cases by intimidating `` clean'' Sicilian businessmen to front for Mafia enterprises. Prosecutors also say that since the investigation that led to the maxitrial, police work has yielded nothing of real substance; four top anti-Mafia detectives were slain by the mob in the last few years. The Mafia is also believed to traffic in arms, but investigators say that business is minimal compared to drug operations. Right-wing terrorists have been linked to the Mafia in alleged arms dealings, but the relationship remains murky, and some investigators say it appears to be overstated. In late January, Italian authorities announced they issued 72 arrest warrants in connection with an international ring in which the Sicilian mob and right-wing extremists work together in drug and weapons trafficking. Among those arrested in raids was <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Cillari </PERSON>, considered the <PERSON> Corleone </PERSON> family's `` cashier'' for his financial dealings.

<HEAD>Methodists Sound Religious Refrain Not To Intervene In Nicaragua</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Another religious voice _ this time from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Latin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> bishops _ has sounded a plea to governments to keep hands off <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and be `` peacemakers and not peacebreakers.'' After extensive talks there, the bishops this week declared `` peace with justice'' is possible, but must recognize `` each nation's right to determine its own destiny'' without interference. This is a long standing demand of most major <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> leadership, <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, in opposing outside mililtary intervention in strife-torn <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says review of policy there and elsewhere still is to be completed and it takes `` a little time,'' particularly since he wants a `` bilaterally supported policy'' there. His chosen secretary of state, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, says he does n't think that `` on humanitarian grounds or moral grounds we can abandon the Contras,'' but should go slow on any more military aid to the rebel group. `` I think it's very, very, important that we move in a unified way here,'' he said. These remarks last week _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a news conference and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee _ indicated new efforts to avoid the past keen partisan conflict over the matter, and possibly new approaches to it. Bishop <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, among those visiting <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, expressed hope the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will take a `` diplomatic rather than confrontational approach'' toward <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. This has been a drawn-out, keenly divisive issue in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, engendering demonstrations, passions on right and left, long congressional battles and narrow votes. It has involved secret <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> mining of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s harbor, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> provisions of arms to Contra rebels, and after such aid was suspended, a scandal over continuing it through illegal military sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. During the eight-year civil war there since the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> toppled a 40-year dictatorship, both mainline Protestant denominations and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops have steadily opposed outside military intervention. The Methodist bishops _ 16 from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and 15 from <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries _ condemned the `` violence and violations against the people'' of Central American nations as making peace impossible. In a `` declaration of peace and solidarity'' issued last Sunday in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s capital, <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, after five days of discussions with a wide range of Nicaraguans, high and low, the bishops pledged: `` We will demand and expect that our governments act with compassion and justice. ... We will publicly challenge our governments to be peacemakers and not peacebreakers. ... `` We will work for the development of policies that respect the sovereign rights of other nations to govern themselves without interference.'' The bishops, representing the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, said they have seen <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s war devastation and they urged negotiated settlements. Similar stands have been taken over the years by various mainline denominations, Presbyterian, Lutheran, <PERSON> Episcopal </PERSON> and other bodies, as well as by the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant-Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops. They have supported <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> humanitarian aid, but not military supplies. The national council's governing board said last May such aid should be `` offered impartially, strictly on the basis of need, free from extraneous objective.'' Monsignor <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoye </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, says the bishops object to any aid to the Contras except such humanitarian aid as food, clothing and resettlement assistance while the peace process develops. The Methodist bishops added another point, noting crippling debts of Central American countries and urging `` swift renegotiation of these debts with favorable terms,'' or total debt forgiveness. <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> said, `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has a marvelous opportunity to help a country find its way. For eight years our policy has been that help must conform to our provisions and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is not willing to do that. `` If we want them to move out of the Marxist bloc then we have to treat them as equals ... instead of as underprivileged children that need to be disciplined and chastized.'' <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Minnick </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, said there was confusion among Nicaraguans about why the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as `` one nation under God'' would stand by and send no aid after the recent destructive hurricane. However, he said the country seems more relaxed than when he visited there with a fact-finding church delegation in 1985. `` Now there is not as much anxiety about terrorist -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- activity.''

 Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> meets the ultimate capitalist, <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON>? If <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagman </PERSON> has his way, the meeting will become a reality in March when `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' is tentatively scheduled to go on location in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hagman </PERSON>, as well as regulars <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Podewell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sheree </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, are tentatively scheduled to leave in March _ the final decision has not yet been made. If it's a go, they will film scenes for `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` I have no idea what the story will be,'' said <PERSON> Hagman </PERSON>, who this season became co-executive producer of the series with <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Katzman </PERSON>. `` I do n't think we'll know until <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> finishes scouting the locations. `` But, <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> exports more oil than any other country, including <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. It's their only source of hard dollars. So I think <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> may do a little dealing.'' And might <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> seek an audience with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>? `` Do n't think we are n't trying! If we could just touch flesh just once. I'm all for it.'' It would n't be the first overseas trip for `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>,'' now in its 12th season. <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> and <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> a few seasons ago. `` It'll be fun,'' said <PERSON> Hagman </PERSON>. `` It'll generate some interest.'' <PERSON> Hagman </PERSON> became co-executive producer in September, a title offered by <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, but he acknowledges it's mainly an excuse. `` They had to find some way to pay me more money,'' he said. `` It was a means of paying me the executive producer's salary, if you want to know the truth.'' <PERSON> Hagman </PERSON> declined to say what his salary is but said an estimate by `` Entertainment Tonight'' that he was making $ 150,000 a week was below the mark. The title `` makes me feel more powerful,'' he said, laughing. `` I did pick my new leading lady this year. I auditioned all the women and selected <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Podewell </PERSON>. She's a joy.'' <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> married <PERSON> Cally </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Podewell </PERSON>, earlier this season in a shotgun wedding. Discussing how long he would stay with `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hagman </PERSON> said, `` It's a sinecure, let's face it. I enjoy it and I make a lot of money. I work three days a week and laugh all day long. They pay me what some countries make. Why move on? The chance of another TV show making it is awfully tough, and at my age, why risk it? `` And why should I go into movies? I do n't know of any movie actor who makes as much as I do. I'm willing to stay with ` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>' as long as it goes on We entertain people. Millions of people watch this show.'' <PERSON> Hagman </PERSON> has used his influence, both as star and co-executive producer, to change the direction of `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>.'' He was instrumental in persuading <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> to return to the show and in getting <PERSON> Charlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Tilton </PERSON> back in her role as <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> left in 1985 after <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON> was struck and killed by an automobile. <PERSON> Hagman </PERSON> felt the tension between <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> was missed. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> returned in 1986 in the famous `` dream'' episode, in which his death _ and the entire season _ were explained away as a dream by <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON>. <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Principal </PERSON>, who played <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON>, has since left the series. <PERSON> Hagman </PERSON> also tried to get her to return. `` I wanted to get the show back to the family,'' said <PERSON> Hagman </PERSON>. `` I think it's best when we're all together. The reason <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> and <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> ended up getting married, was to get us out and doing something physical. `` It got us out of sitting around the boardroom making deals. There'll still be that undercurrent, but it has to be interesting. Maybe we can make a deal with the Russians.'' Has J.R. changed over the years? `` As an actor you sometimes paint yourself into corner you do n't anticipate until later,'' he answered. `` <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON>'s not as raw as he was. He's still amorous. He married this young girl.''

<HEAD>Bush Honeymoon Sweet, Save for a Few Ripples</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 They used to call him wimp, but as a beaten Democratic rival tells it, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is so tough now that he can gargle with water from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. That's Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s joke, and it tells of the transformation that accompanies a political honeymoon. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is enjoying his, but he's been around _ he knows it wo n't last. `` I do n't expect it's all going to be sweetness and harmony and light,'' he said. He addresses <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> one week from tonight, filling in blanks on his agenda, especially on the budget deficit. `` The minute we get those proposals up there ... I expect we're going to have other firestorms swirling around,'' he said The big bills run up by the government during the <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> era are coming due and there is no painless way to pay them. That surely will lead to some partisan spats, but it does n't mean the honeymoon will be over. Presidential honeymoons with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> usually last well into warm weather in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and end gradually, issue by issue. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, the unelected president, was an exception. He had a month's harmony and then pardoned <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> for Watergate. Not long ago there were suggestions that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would n't get a honeymoon at all, not after the long, often negative presidential campaign. The Democrats surely would n't forget that. They did, almost immediately. `` The change in <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is impressive,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee, said at a stag, black-tie dinner last Saturday night. `` This time last year he was being called a wimp. Now he's so tough he gargles with water from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was there to laugh at the ribbing about his campaign television commercial blaming <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for pollution in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said during the transition that campaign bitterness would n't last `` Nobody remembers campaigns, ads about <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>,'' he said then. `` The country's looking forward.'' But the early <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> honeymoon has been smoother than he could have expected. It has been a time harmony and calm, save for what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called a few ripples. One followed an administration suggestion that a fee on bank depositors might be the way to pay the price of the savings and loan crisis. Another was stirred by conservative Republicans who questioned whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nominee to head the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> really opposes abortion. He said he does. Actually, the flap over fees for an S & amp; L bailout could serve the administration's interests. That unpopular idea was floated early in the process; alternatives could look better by comparison. And the abortion controversy had more to do with conservative orthodoxy than with substance. Cabinet confirmation proceedings in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> have produced more Democratic praise than pointed criticism. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he will not press Senate-approved legislation that would compel presidents to advise <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> within 48 hours of covert intelligence operations, holding off on `` a mutual assumption of good faith'' with the new administration. Of such assumptions are honeymoons made. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s was different, since he held the political shotgun when he came to power in 1981. Republicans had captured the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and strengthened their <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> minority. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was as powerful a campaigner in office as out. He got <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to do his bidding by keeping the pressure on. Democrats kept pronouncing the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> honeymoon over, but he kept winning. It was mid-summer when his tax cut bill came to a final vote in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and the president won decisively after a televised bid for support that swamped congressmen with telephone calls and telegrams. `` Never in my 30 years here have I see that kind of pressure,'' said former Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> Jr.. President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> had a shaky honeymoon in unfamiliar territory He was the outsider and he tended to handle <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that way, even though it was dominated by fellow Democrats. His first nominee to head the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> had to withdraw or risk rejection by a Democratic Senate. His early travels and appointments were set without advance word to Democrats from the state involved. He took on powerful congressional interests in an effort to cut back federal rivers and harbors projects and wound up with half the cut he sought, after a long and politically costly battle. While most of his major proposals were approved, it never was an easy partnership.

<HEAD>Firm's Device Connects Ticker Tape to Investor's Personal Computer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FAIRFIELD, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A fledgling company operating out of a 10-room house in this rural southeast <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> town claims it is enabling investors nationwide to track stock portfolios via cable television instead of relying on brokerages. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Blokker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Randall </PERSON>, co-founders of <ORGANIZATION> CableSoft </ORGANIZATION>, said their product Live Wire consists of a specially designed computer keyboard that, when hooked to cable TV, finds the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> channel. It reads the ticker tape that runs across the bottom of the television screen, quoting prices of stocks from the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and over-the-counter stocks. The device converts the characters from the TV screen and relays them to the user's personal computer screen. Besides tracking a particular stock, a Live Wire user also can program at what price to buy or sell. An alarm bell rings when that threshold is reached, <ORGANIZATION> Blokker </ORGANIZATION> said. The device also can make long-term stock earnings calculations, he said. To comply with <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> guidelines, there is a 15-minute delay from the time the quotes are issued by stock exchanges and the time they first appear on <ORGANIZATION> FNN </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Blokker </PERSON> called that a minor disadvantage since most investors get delayed stock information anyway from their brokers. <ORGANIZATION> CableSoft </ORGANIZATION>'s Live Wire product costs about $ 1,000, he said, `` a one-time cost.'' `` Anyone who does interday trading, on the average of more than five trades on a single day, then you need real-time data. If you trade once a day, a 15-minute delay data is fine,'' <ORGANIZATION> Blokker </ORGANIZATION> said. Most personal investors, he said, are now utilizing information services such as Dow Jones News Retrieval or <ORGANIZATION> CompuServe </ORGANIZATION> once a night to get stock quotes, which they enter into their personal computers. But <ORGANIZATION> CableSoft </ORGANIZATION>'s co-founders say their service is better because it provides quotes during the entire day. <ORGANIZATION> CableSoft </ORGANIZATION> unveiled Live Wire this past summer at a trade show in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` They said we were the hit of the show because we were something new _ brand-new and totally unique,'' <ORGANIZATION> Blokker </ORGANIZATION> said. The idea for Live Wire surfaced when <ORGANIZATION> Blokker </ORGANIZATION> was working toward a doctoral degree in electrical engineering at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, he said. He left school to join <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> in a separate business venture that eventually collapsed. `` We sat around for about a week wondering, ` What should we do now?' So I remembered this old idea, and we decided to try it,'' <ORGANIZATION> Blokker </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Blokker </ORGANIZATION> said he figured it would take about a year before they could start marketing Live Wire, but it took four years instead. <ORGANIZATION> CableSoft </ORGANIZATION>, headquartered in a blue, three-story, 10-room house in <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION>, has 16 employees. Each Live Wire machine is still made individually, but mass production is planned soon via a contract with <PERSON> Vantronics </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> manufacturing concern. <ORGANIZATION> CableSoft </ORGANIZATION> began marketing Live Wire several months ago and has sold about 200 machines so far, <ORGANIZATION> Blokker </ORGANIZATION> said. He envisioned big sales because there are an estimed 2 million people using personal computers to follow stocks. `` If we can penetrate that market, if we get 10 percent of that market, that means we've sold 200,000 units. That's $ 200 million in cash flow. That's a lot of money,'' he said.

<HEAD>Criticizing The Old Measures of Performance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In recent weeks some of the economy's biggest fears, including those all-American worries about big trade and budget deficits, have been attacked by critics as being overdrawn. Budget deficits, they point out, are no higher now than in many other years when measured as a percentage of gross national product. Besides, unless we go on another spending spree, they say, we might even tame the beast in the 1990s. And, it is argued, the equally worrisome trade deficit already is on the way to being alleviated if not corrected, with export orders building and American companies showing daily evidence that they are competitive again. On a larger scale, serious questions have been raised about the inevitability of the economic cycle. Is n't it just `` economic nature'' for expansions to be followed by recessions? Maybe not, some now say. Some of the reasoning in regard to the less-cyclical nature of the economy is interesting if not convincing. Rather than having national or global downturns, it is argued, we have downturns limited to regions or industries. There is evidence, for example, that this very thing might have occurred in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy over the past six years or so. We avoided a national recession, it is said. Instead, regional downturns relieved the pressure. Two years ago, for instance, many areas dependent on oil, mining, agriculture and certain types of manufacturing were indeed in recession, but national statistics did n't show it because of East and West coast booms. Thus, for official purposes, the country never had a traditional recession in this period. But sensible economic minds and millions of Americans know very well that recessionary conditions existed for much of the country. Have the definitions and rules changed? Old-timers will tell you that to toss out the old rules and the traditional assumptions is a step toward disaster. Just as soon as you get ready to abandon the old guidelines, they say, the old guidelines reassert themselves. They observe, for example, that abandonment of old measures of values often accompany every explosive bull market in stocks, only to be embraced again as prices plunge back to reality. Still, there remains an important area where existing measures might indeed be out of whack. Americans, it has been said for decades, are among the world's worst savers, putting away only a fraction of what the Japanese save. From 1982 to 1987 the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> savings rate was a mere 3.7 percent of gross national product, compared with several times that in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Americans, it was said, were squandering their income instead of investing it in progress. But several economists point out that demographics might have had something to do with this low rate. And others, most recently <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, suggest the definition of savings might be incorrect. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> director of economics, contends the baby boom bulge in the population, a phenomenon that is destined to disappear, has skewed the conventional savings rate. As the baby boomers _ born after World War II _ grow older they will become less active spenders, he says. Their big expenses for education, housing and the like will have been met; they will have the ability and desire to save. So convinced is he that this thesis is correct, <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON> has gone way out on a limb, forcasting a sharp rise in the savings rate from 4 percent or so to 10 percent over the next five years. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> assistant secretary, argues that there are methodological quirks in the calculation of savings rate. And now <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> adds further doubts about the accuracy of official savings rates. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s question concerns a situation that, at least on the surface, appears to be contradictory. Down payments by buyers of houses are counted as savings, but capital gains received by sellers of houses are not. Count those capital gains received by sellers of homes that have multiplied in value, and you might see a very different savings rate for Americans. And a lot less criticism of their profligacy.

 Closed down by President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> in 1972 and reopened just over a year ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> now is swept up in scandals. Hardly had the dust settled on a scandal involving firearms imports when members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> were facing charges of trying to corner the export of coconuts to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also has come under fire for deciding to use taxpayers' money to buy 35 foreign luxury cars for each of its 23 members and certain staff. Just before the coconut scandal broke in late January, columnist <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> wrote that the rubber-stamp congressmen during <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' time `` look like saints compared to the members of -LRB- this -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` First, some gunrunners in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> import hundreds of high-powered automatic firearms for the protection of congressmen _ and the rest for the lucrative black market,'' he added. `` Just as the public heaved a collective sigh of relief that ... the senators are not involved in this caper comes the revelation that all 23 senators have ordered new cars.'' The coconut scandal exploded Jan. 25 when the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coconut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> claimed at least 12 congressmen were pressuring his organization to grant them exclusive rights to export 4,500 tons of fresh coconut to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> said the congressmen, from four coconut-growing provinces south of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, were insisting that the authority not only restore a quota system it had recently scrapped but also to partition the coconut export quota among themselves. He said that until last year, his agency awarded the entire quota to a group of Filipino exporters but decided three months ago to stop the practice because of complaints from other groups. The move was also in line with the government's policy of deregulation. The congressmen, led by Rep. <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON>, claimed they simply were trying to protect the interests of small coconut farmers in their provinces from middlemen they claim had monopolized the export in the past. <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sub-Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Edible Crops, denied <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>'s charges and accused him of receiving bribes from middlemen. The uproar over the firearms scandal is not over, even though the 200-member <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> cleared two congressmen of wrongdoing in the importation of more than 600 Israeli-made <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> and Galil automatic rifles. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> said the imports lacked permits from his department; customs officials said other regulations were broken. Nevertheless, after a closed special session, the House ruled that the two congressmen who brokered the importation did not commit any improprieties. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted, however, to turn the weapons over to the military `` in response to public opinion.'' Reps. <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutang </PERSON> and <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> Unico </PERSON>, both retired military officers, said the guns were to have been paid for by the congressmen with their own money. They said the legislators needed the weapons to defend themselves from rising crime and threats from communist rebels. As the gun controversy raged, someone leaked the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to buy 35 new cars The public uproar was immediate, with most comment accusing the senators of callousness in light of widespread poverty. Callers to television and radio programs threatened to stone senators in their new cars. One woman offered cash rewards to people who actually did so. A few senators dropped the idea following the uproar, but <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jovito </PERSON> <PERSON> Salonga </PERSON> and other senators insist that public officials have a right to have official vehicles. Other scandals to hit the House involved pork barrel funds and other allowances. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitra </PERSON> handed an envelope containing 20,000 pesos -LRB- $ 1,000 -RRB- to a member of the congressional press corps on the eve of the legislature's Christmas recess. Some newspapers immediately assailed the move as an attempt to buy off the press. <PERSON> Mitra </PERSON> said, however, the money was given in lieu of a `` traditional blowout'' congress gives reporters after passing the national budget. The money was eventually spent by <PERSON> Mitra </PERSON> on a dinner for the entire press corps.

 On a leather strap around the young woman's neck hung a plum-sized chunk of quartz. `` It puts a circle of power around you that keeps you feeling protected,'' said <PERSON> Marybeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroebel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON>, a graphic artist for a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> advertising firm. `` The crystal shields you,'' she said. `` If you know how to get in tune with it, it helps you be more safe and calm when you encounter some unpleasant situation. It's electromagnetic, you know.'' Such minute energy pervades the known universe, including every piece of earth, but an esoteric view of the New Age movement is that quartz crystals give off a soothing, guarding aura. This is among an effusion of the movement's exotic ideas _ extra-terrestrial beings, reincarnation, out-of-body experiences, `` rebirthing tanks,'' mantras and `` channeling'' wisdom from the ancients. It's `` a hybrid mix,'' says <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, author of one of the most comprehensive, balanced books yet on the movement, `` Understanding the New Age,'' issued by Word Publishing. `` Some of its kookier fads may have peaked and be passing,'' he said in an interview. `` But the fallout of New Age thinking and its impact is going to be around for a long time. `` Many of its subtleties have penetrated the entire culture. It's very attractive and seductive, promising quick spirituality Its eclectic appeal resonates with a lot of people in our pluralistic society.'' He said the movement's key premise, `` in simple terms, is that everything is God and God is everything and we can become God. That's the point of all the techniques to attain altered states of consciousness.'' Asked if such playing God was n't the biblical wrongdoing of <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> and the Tower of Babel _ and of tyrants of history _ <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said it was. `` It's all right there in the opening chapters of Genesis.'' However, he said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Agers </LOCATION> do n't see God in the Judeo-Christian sense as a supremely personal sovereign who reveals his truth through history, but as an impersonal `` it,'' an `` energy force that penetrates the universe.'' `` God is a sort of loose energy ball rattling around the universe,'' <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said. `` Of course, you ca n't derive the Ten Commandments or any ultimate standards from a loose energy ball.'' He terms such `` moral relativism'' a fault of the movement, saying its notion of reincarnation puts `` a different spin on lying, stealing, adultery, even murder,'' since victims are assumed coming back unhurt in another life. However, <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> emphasized that the movement is varying and fluid. `` You sign no creed. People buy into it at different levels,'' he said, espousing only bits or much of it. `` It has no coherent organization or headquarters that issues pronouncements or any single leadership,'' he said. But it does have key theoreticians and `` hard-core strategists,'' he said, and is promoted in psychic fairs, seminars, therapies and publications, its ideas sprinkling TV and movie fare and even business motivational training. `` <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLaine </PERSON> is kind of the high priestess of the movement,'' he said, noting that her TV appearances and books made most people aware of it. Its slogan: `` You create your own reality.'' <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, 56, an award-winning religion writer for the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, took an eight-months leave for researching the movement, interviewing both its critics and fervent followers. He says it holds that `` everything is one vast, interconnected process,'' that the `` cosmos is pure energy,'' that `` all is one,'' that individuals can attain `` higher selves'' and the world gain unified harmony. `` Humanity is deified, death is denied and ignorance _ not evil _ is the enemy,'' <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> writes of the movement. He says New Agers believe the world nears a `` profound breakthrough'' when the `` limited, finite Old Order will give way to a glorious, unlimited New Order of peace, prosperity and perfection.'' `` Thousands of New Age activists seek to transform society through New Age precepts,'' he writes. As the year 2000 approaches, he adds, `` New Age millenial expectations will likely crescendo to fever pitch.'' Although seeming new, he says the movement's core ideas stem from 2,500-year-old Buddhism's view of `` higher consciousness'' or `` true self'' and 3,500-year-old <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION>'s view of death-rebirth cycles toward blissful oneness. He says the movement reflects other old influences such as primitive animism's deifying of nature, the ancient heresy of gnosticism, claiming divine `` knowing,'' and old-time seances renamed `` channeling'' It's all `` recycled and dressed up in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> clothes to appeal to our age now,'' <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> commented. He sees some positive elements in the movement _ its emphasis on cooperation, on protecting the earth, on internationalism and peace, on `` right-brain'' intuitive thinking, on bodily health through exercise and good food. It `` is neither the hellish conspiracy that fundamentalist critics charge, nor the utopian bliss its fondest supporters imagine,'' <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> writes. He says `` the insidious danger of the New Age'' is its view of reality as being without absolutes. `` History provides evidence that relative standards of morality breed chaos and _ ultimately _ the downfall of society.''

 <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondlane </PERSON>, educated in a one-room schoolhouse near <LOCATION> Downer </LOCATION>'s Grove, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, was 17 and dreaming of becoming a doctor in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> when she met an African revolutionary at a summer church camp. He changed her life. It was 1951, and <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondlane </PERSON>, who became the founder and first president of the <ORGANIZATION> Mozambican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, was 31 and lecturing at church camps as part of his scholarship to <ORGANIZATION> Oberlin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. `` I am a product of <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondlane </PERSON>,'' says his widow, 55, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, still wracked by war and famine 14 years after independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and 20 years after her husband's assassination. `` I grew up in this little town near <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Until I was 7 I lived out in the country,'' the former <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> recalled in an interview. `` Life was calm, very stable, not many ideas were passing through.'' She said, `` <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> was able to write on a blank sheet and he wrote on it until the time he died.'' On Feb. 3, 1969, <PERSON> Mondlane </PERSON> was killed by a parcel bomb at his office in <LOCATION> Dar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Es </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salaam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>, where the revolutionary movement _ known by its <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> acronym, <ORGANIZATION> Frelimo </ORGANIZATION> _ was headquartered during the war against the Portuguese. `` During the whole long struggle every now and then you had to pick up the children and leave the house in the middle of the night because word came that someone was coming to attack,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mondlane </PERSON> said. `` I'm not at all a violent person. As a matter of fact I'm rather a passivist. But my life has been very much linked with war, unfortunately.'' Her work as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Mozambican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> involves providing emergency aid for millions of refugees displaced by fighting between the <LOCATION> Frelimo </LOCATION> government, which took power in 1975 under a Marxist constitution, and guerrillas of the Mozambican National Resistance, supported for many years by the white-minority governments of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and what then was <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Mondlane </PERSON> said she is not a Marxist but is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Frelimo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and a deputy in the People's Assembly, the national legislature. Today's <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> is not what she had expected, she said. `` I never counted on so much war, that's for sure. We thought that it would be possible to develop the country. It has n't been.'' A major decision of her life was relinquishing her American citizenship. `` The rest of my family is in the States. It's a question of do you break these ties or do n't you, really throw in the lot or not? `` I decided yes, this is really my country. I really dedicated my life to this country since I met <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON>, and that's a long time ago. `` I went to the church camp in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, and there was <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON>. We students were supposed to go to a different lecture every day. I went to the lecture Monday on <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and stayed there. I was just mesmerized.'' She and <PERSON> Mondlane </PERSON> exchanged letters for the next 18 months. After high school graduation she went to <ORGANIZATION> Marianhill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> to be near him, then they both transferred to <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` Blacks and whites did n't get married then,'' she said. `` The process took five years, trying to work through things with my family. There was a lot of hullabaloo from his missionary friends about marrying instead of going to the <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Mondlane </PERSON> went to work for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and did n't return to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> until 1961. After nine months as a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mondlane </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>, where three Mozambican exile groups united in 1962 under his leadership and began the guerrilla war. After her husband's death, Mrs. <PERSON> Mondlane </PERSON> helped fund schools and medical posts in the northern provinces that <ORGANIZATION> Frelimo </ORGANIZATION> controlled until independence came in 1975. `` What I'd like to do is go and work on my farm -LRB- in the countryside -RRB- but here I am still working here, doing the same thing I was doing all my life,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Mondlane </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 For <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> and <PERSON> Juanita </PERSON> <PERSON> Pichardo </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> immigrants in their mid-60s, owning a tiny beachfront room for their golden years was the payback for 30 years of hard work and modest living in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> wanted a retirement free of mortgage payments and troubles when she paid nearly $ 30,000 cash for a room on the 12th floor of the Carillon Hotel. Now she says her money went to `` gangsters.'' The dreams of nearly 300 people who say they thought they were buying security in the form of rooms at the once-grand hotel soured almost as fast as developer <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamel </PERSON> sold 72-year subleases on rooms in 1983. Rooms were bought for as little as $ 20,000 as an investment believed to be secure through 2055. Five years later, the 17-story, 600-room hotel on <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> is mired in lawsuits, bankruptcies and foreclosures, back under control of its original property holder, Main Realty, and the tenants face eviction. Main Realty slipped eviction notices under tenants' doors in November, setting a Jan. 2 deadline. Tenants on Dec. 20 sued all the principals in the Carillon. In late December the landlord agreed not to take any action until the case is heard in court, expected sometime late this year. Despite the reprieve, many tenants are worried and confused, and feel deceived. Many of the elderly residents could lose their investments, and _ because they are living on fixed incomes _ fear for their future. `` To live here was to live on top of the world,'' <PERSON> Pichardo </PERSON>, 67, said wistfully as he walked across the hotel's virtually empty pool deck. <PERSON> Juanita </PERSON> <PERSON> Pichardo </PERSON> recalls when the couple used most of their savings to buy a small room overlooking the pool for $ 27,000. `` The hotel was beautiful and everything was working. It had entertainment at night _ bingo, movies, orchestras on the weekend. Now I realize it was too good to be true.'' At the height of what usually is a bustling winter season, only a handful of residents _ with their own chairs since the hotel removed nearly all of the chaise lounges _ sit around a sediment-filled pool. Birds splash the water since the pool was shut down by the county health department. The resort, whose hotel license has n't been renewed pending further inquiry by the state, is a haven for crack cocaine addicts; the rooftop once used as a luxury health spa is littered and reeks of urine. Two full-service outdoor bars are stripped bare, sheets cover missing chandeliers in the cavernous Art Deco lobby and the restaurant has long been closed. Residents complain of a faulty phone system, unreliable elevators, leaky pipes, graffiti and garbage-strewn stairwells. Street people rove the 1957 white-and-aqua-trimmed resort, which has been cited for multiple code and fire violations. `` A lot of older ladies are afraid to come out at night,'' said <PERSON> Bart </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinman </PERSON>, who rents a room. `` When they bought the place, they were promised the world. Basically, they're living in an abandoned building.'' <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> and <PERSON> Juanita </PERSON> <PERSON> Pichardo </PERSON>, a retired bartender and seamstress, live on Social Security of $ 650 a month and some interest income. Their mortgage payments are $ 393 a month, plus $ 224 a month for maintenance. `` It's a very bad situation,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Pichardo </PERSON> said. `` Really, I am a good fighter. But some days, I just get disgusted.'' The stressful situation recently landed tenant association president <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> DuLimba </PERSON> in the hospital with a burst ulcer. `` These people come in, abuse the law 100 percent and get away with it,'' said <PERSON> DuLimba </PERSON>, who has spent the past 2 -LCB- years fighting to improve conditions at the rat-and-roach infested hotel. He says his life has been threatened, and two bullets from a .44 Magnum were put through his front door. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganguzza </PERSON>, the tenants' attorney, says unsophisticated investors were taken in a murky real estate venture that never was economically viable. He and tenants also say the city has taken no serious enforcement action despite the building having been written up for violations dozens of times. `` It's a regular stop,'' said senior license inspector <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Tye </PERSON>. City inspectors acknowledge that even though the hotel's owners have not been in compliance, they apparently have not paid fines. `` The whole problem stems from changes in ownership'' that make enforcement difficult, said fire inspector <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. The tenants' $ 5 million lawsuit seeks an injunction against the evictions, and damages for fraud, <PERSON> Ganguzza </PERSON> said. Defendants are <ORGANIZATION> Main </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which owned the property originally and holds it again; <ORGANIZATION> Carol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which leased from them; and <PERSON> Gamel </PERSON> _ who had purchsed the rights to lease property _ among other individuals and companies associated with the Carillon. Main Realty says tenants face eviction because of hundreds of thousands of dollars in back rent and maintenance fees. <PERSON> Ganguzza </PERSON> maintains the tenants have paid all along; where that money went is part of the dispute. The problem is not new to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Ganguzza </PERSON> said this complex case is fairly unusual. `` Of course, elderly people are more vulnerable to these type of schemes,'' he said. <PERSON> Gamel </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanzman </PERSON>, said his client was sympathetic to the problems at the Carillon but was n't to blame. `` It appears as though a large majority of the problems ... are the result of actions that were taken by parties who operated the hotel after Mr. <PERSON> Gamel </PERSON> sold his interest in the master lease'' in May 1987, though operating control was transferred in mid-1986, <PERSON> Hanzman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinton </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, attorney for Main Realty, had no comment on the suit. Meanwhile, rumors swirl and the air hangs heavy at the Carillon as tenants ponder their futures. `` I have no money. I have nobody. No relatives, no friends, nothing,'' said 76-year-old Ms. <PERSON> Werner </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> who survived the Holocaust and the disappearance of her only child only to give her money to `` gangsters.'' <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiedler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION>, N.Y, wo n't even risk renting the two rooms they bought after an elderly woman they had rented to successfully sued them in small claims court over poor hotel services. The economic crimes division of the state attorney's office is investigating complaints at the Carillon, but could provide no further details. <PERSON> DuLimba </PERSON> said the state attorney's office indicated `` there was possibly a big case here,'' but he said virtually nothing has been done to help tenants. While some believe the complex case will take a long time to resolve and that it's unlikely a judge would make an unpopular decision to go ahead with evictions, others are n't as optimistic. `` If I could,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Pichardo </PERSON>, `` I'd leave in a minute.''

<TEXT>
 Do this winter's mild, dry conditions in many parts of the nation bode ill for the 1989 growing season? Is the unusual weather causing problems already? It depends on where the questions are asked, and of whom. Here are the findings of <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporters who surveyed each region.

<NOTE>The Corn Belt</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 The fear of a second drought looms over pockets of the still parched Corn Belt, where it's premature to predict another year of pain, but not too early to worry about whether a mild winter will bring farmers a harsh spring. Though thousands of acres of <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> farm fields were ravaged by the drought of'88, much of the eastern <LOCATION> Corn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belt </LOCATION> _ an area east of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> _ is in moderately good shape because of abundant rain last fall. `` We've come a long way from where we were at the end of the growing season,'' said <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> <PERSON> Strommen </PERSON>, chief meteorologist for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` It will be very important to see what happens in the next three months filling in holes where it remains dry.'' Experts say west-central <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, eastern <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, northern <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> have yet to recover from the drought. The difference in Corn Belt conditions is reflected in precipitation since Oct. 1. The western section received 74 percent of normal precipitation, while the eastern Corn Belt received 119 percent, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Leavitt </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Even with above average rains, conditions are so dry it'll take time for the baked earth to return to rich black prairie soil. Though <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> had normal moisture since August, it still had only 21.64 inches of precipitation in 1988, the lowest level since 1910, said state climatologist <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillaker </PERSON>. `` It's going to take six to 12 months of normal rain to get things back to the way it should be,'' he said. Dry weather not only affects corn, but another major <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> crop _ soybeans, which in 1988 were at their lowest production level since 1976: 1.54 billion bushels. Beyond crops, the unusually warm, snow-scarce winter has disappointed <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> snowmobilers, postponed some farm equipment purchases and led some <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> towns to dig new wells. Still, experts say there's no reason to panic _ now. `` It's too early to worry about not having a crop,'' said <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Harl </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> economics professor. `` But it's not too early to worry about the consequences if you did.'' _ By <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> regional reporter, based in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.

 It's been a hard winter for <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, owner of a <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, ski area. Not because of winter weather, but because of the lack of it. `` I thought last year was bad in terms of lack of snow,'' she said, `` but compared to this year, it was pretty good.'' Scarcity of snow is n't a worry just to small ski operators. Officials throughout the Northeast are keeping a nervous eye on half-filled water reservoirs. Farmers fret about soil moisture. Businesses selling snowmobiles and snowplows are hurting. `` This is disastrous,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Kitchen </PERSON>, who has sold half the usual number of snow tires at his <LOCATION> Biddeford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, service station. The winter of 1988-89 is likely to be remembered as the Winter of No Snow. `` This has been the driest January in 104 years,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamrosh </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> meteorologist in <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Champlain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> has had 19.9 inches of snow compared to the normal average of 42 inches The story is the same from <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> as far south as <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. `` Generally, we have had below normal snowfall,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucadamo </PERSON>, a hydrologist with the weather service's <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forecast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Center </LOCATION>. `` If this continues we could see some problems.'' Problems are already evident. Officials in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> have issued warnings about water supplies. Reservoirs that supply some big Eastern cities are about 30 percent below normal levels. `` Not only are we well below what we normally are, but there is no snow upstate and you rely on the melt off of that snowpack in the spring,'' said <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION>.

 As the drought of 1988 becomes the drought of'89, the nation's breadbasket is worried about producing half a loaf this year Last year's drought hit hard at the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> states, which produce most of the hard red winter wheat, the primary grain in bread. Lack of moisture this winter in the heartland has agronomists and statisticians nervous because another below-average crop could further deplete <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s grain reserves and raise food prices. Planted in the fall, winter wheat lies dormant until spring, when it matures and ripens. It is harvested in the summer. Farmers in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, the country's No. 1 wheat-growing state, and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION> all say they've been short-changed on moisture since 1980, with last year's drought the worst on record for many of them. In the past few months rain and snowfall have been sparse and spotty. Eastern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> are a little better off than the last two years, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> are a little worse. <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> is about even. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, which lost 68 percent of its wheat crop last year, the autumn rains did n't come. `` At the end of the year we were about seven inches behind in annual precipitation,'' said <PERSON> Eldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiessen </PERSON>, deputy statistician for the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> office. `` The ground was so dry this fall the wheat never developed a good root system. The soil is so loose that if the wind starts to blow the crop will be destroyed.'' <LOCATION> Sumner </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, annually produces more wheat than any other county in the nation. Last year its farmers harvested 13.8 million bushels, but county extension agent <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> LeValley </PERSON> says an unusually warm winter, lack of snow and rain and the appearance of bugs in January all have him worried.

 Winter storms veering to the north have taken the edge off the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>'s drought, but only at the expense of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, where forecasters fear a third parched year. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, two dry months have dashed hopes raised by heavy November rains. Statewide, precipitation is 80 percent of normal, and water runoff into rivers is less than 50 percent of normal, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, state <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. Reservoirs are at their lowest since 1977. February and March, which usually provide nearly a third of the year's rain and snow, will need 125 percent of normal precipitation to make up the shortfall, he said. If runoff remains low, water to irrigated farmland may be cut by up to 40 percent this summer, he said. `` The last two years have been critically dry. Last year, we survived by drawing deeply into our reserves. This year we do n't have the reserves,'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, where lawns have gone unwatered and fountains are dry per order of the water department, officials plan to continue conservation measures instituted last year. In northern <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, `` things are looking pretty bleak,'' said state climatologist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>. January precipitation was about 20 percent of normal, he said. Last summer, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>'s drought cut off water to some irrigated fields, killed fish in overheated streams, and cut into recreation business around a lowered <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, a cold and dry January has dimmed hopes that were raised by a snowy December. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, several northward-tracking storms off the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> have dumped enough snow to make water officials breathe easier.

 While other <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> states have had a warmer, drier winter than normal, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> has had unusual shots of colder air, more rain and even a mild citrus freeze. `` Between Christmas and the middle of January, we had below normal temperatures and above normal percipitation _ and that's related to the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> being warmer and drier,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> meteorologist in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> has had almost double its usual rainfall for January _ but that's still just a little more than an inch. Temperatures have averaged near-normal, but there have been unusual cold snaps because of a shift in the jet stream across the country. The extent of damage from a citrus freeze has n't been determined, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gronowski </PERSON>, a Commission on Agriculture supervisor. `` The overall problem was not disastrous, but there was damage,'' he said. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> have all had milder winters. <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> had only 5 percent of its normal rainfall in December, and January was well below normal in most areas of the state, meteorologist <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. A recent survey of mountain snow-pack depths, however, found near-normal levels. In west <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, millions of acres of winter wheat are in terrible shape, drought expert <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Krieg </PERSON> said, and the lack of moisture poses problems for the summer growing season as well. `` We have no subsoil moisture and so we're going into the crop season with a severe water deficit. The top six feet are literally air dry,'' said <PERSON> Krieg </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The warm, dry winter will spawn a dust problem when spring winds arrive, <PERSON> Krieg </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, December temperatures averaged 4 degrees warmer than usual, and remained above normal for 20 of the first 25 days of January, meteorologist <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunting </PERSON> said.

<NOTE>The Southeast</NOTE>

 This winter has been unusually warm in the Southeast, prompting fruit trees to bud early and causing fears of damage if a freeze comes, but rainfall levels throughout the region generally have been normal. `` Our topsoil moisture levels are in the best shape they've been in for years,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Brantner </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> weather statistician based in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, a state hit hard by last year's drought. He added, `` Our stock ponds have been replenished by the good rains we had last fall. `` And things are continuing to look good so far this year; our pastures are doing well and the winter wheat crop is thriving.'' However, the warmer temperatures, averaging between 3 and 8 degrees above normal since the beginning of winter, are beginning to worry fruit growers in some areas of the Southeast. Growers across the region, and especially in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> _ two states that produce much of the nation's peach crop _ are keeping a close eye on their trees. `` In <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> we've already gotten some reports of early blooms,'' said J.T. `` <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>'' <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> weather statistician for that state. `` The growers are worried that a cold snap will move in and kill all those early blooms.'' Ski resort operators in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> say the days there also have been warmer than usual. But they add that the nights have been cold enough to allow them to keep their slopes covered with man-made snow. <PERSON> J.B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, ticketing manager at the Beech Mountain resort near <LOCATION> Boone </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, said sales have held up so far despite the warm weather. Overall, climatologists and weather watchers say topsoil moisture levels are in good shape in the Southeast but that they could use more slow, soaking rains to replenish the subsoil levels. They also say planting conditions should be good this spring, barring a sudden change in the weather. _ By <PERSON> Strat </PERSON> <PERSON> Douthat </PERSON>, Southeast regional reporter, based in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>.

 Towboat operators are uneasy. So are <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> stock traders, German manufacturers and Japanese grain importers whose fortunes hinge on whether a repeat of the drought will disrupt barge traffic on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. `` Everybody's a little apprehensive,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON>, a hydrologist with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> who is keeping a wary eye on snowpack and water buildup in the upper <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>. `` But we're much, much better prepared. If it does happen again, it will be less traumatic,'' <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON> said. River forecasters say the next six weeks will be critical to spring river levels. Most worrisome is below-normal snowfall in the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and other states in the upper <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. Things seem OK for now in the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valleys </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, engineers hoping to head off trouble after record low water levels last summer are using four dredges to scrape rock ledges and shoals out of the channel between <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` Normally, we would n't have any dredges out now. This is the first time since the 1930s we've had more than three dredges out at this time. We want to be ready,'' said <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkes </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. The 2,348-mile long <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> is a natural superhighway into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> heartland, carrying 400 million tons of goods yearly. It hauls 57 percent of the nation's grain, 40 percent of its oil products and 20 percent of its coal, plus fertilizer, cement, chemicals, auto parts and other bulk. The <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> keeps a 9-foot deep, 300-foot wide channel for barges. But the drought closed the river in spots for 96 days until giant scoops cleared away sediment. The worst bottlenecks were in late June at <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, and the mouth of the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, when 130 towboats came to a standstill for three days. The cargo on their barges could have filled a convoy of 18-wheelers stretching from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, Ore. The lowest water levels since records were first kept in 1872 were set in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> and two other spots in July. Losses for the year were estimated from $ 65 million to $ 200 million in a survey by barge operators. `` The drought came out faster and more furious than anyone could have imagined. It was never so low for so long,'' said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, vice president of the American Waterways Operators. `` It was a very difficult year that could have been a catastrophe,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` This year, we're prepared for the worst.''

 Traffic droned on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turnpike </ORGANIZATION> just as on any other Tuesday morning. Commuters passed through the rest area here just as sleepy-eyed. But something was amiss, and if <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cieplensky </PERSON> had n't spotted it someone might be dead now _ in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, perhaps, or <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> _ from the shrapnel of a homemade bomb. Cieplensky, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> state trooper, saw a disheveled young man in the rest area parking lot, walking in circles, looking under a car, heading one way, then another. When the man got into a brown <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> and pulled out _ narrowly missing parked cars, the trooper said _ he stopped him. The <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> turned out to contain not just <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>, later identified as a member of the terrorist <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, but also electrical fusing devices, two clocks, precision tools, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline timetables, maps of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and other places, a bottle of Ten High whiskey and 36 $ 100 bills. A search also found three foot-long steel canisters packed with gunpowder and lead shot. Kikumura faces sentencing Monday in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> following his November conviction for transporting the bombs `` with the knowledge and intent that they would be used to kill, injure and intimidate.'' Though no one knows the bombs' intended target _ sources speculated it was a meeting of finance ministers in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> or an economic summit in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> or that pinholes in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> map marked the spot _ <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>'s case and others like it raise a troubling question: Are Americans, who have long felt safe at home, becoming more vulnerable to terrorists? `` The fact that we have been free from terrorist acts to the extent we have is in some ways amazing,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Terwilliger </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who last year prosecuted three Lebanese natives stopped just inside the Vermont-Canada border with makeshift bombs. Federal investigators said they belonged to an organization that assassinated <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s President-elect <PERSON> Bashir </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>. `` Are we vulnerable? Absolutely,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolz </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, whose consulting firm trains other nations' police in handling terrorist incidents. `` This is a democratic country, with wide-open borders,'' added <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, a terrorism expert at the <ORGANIZATION> Rand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> think tank in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` It's not as though we're protected by a high wall.'' Nonetheless, <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> generally lacks the driving forces of home-grown terrorism: ideology -LRB- usually `` Americans kill in personal quarrels, not for causes'' -RRB- and ethnic grievances -LRB- the independence movement in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> is an exception -RRB-. As for foreign terrorists, why attack on American soil when there are convenient <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> targets abroad, from embassies to fast-food restaurants? `` It's easier to cross a street than cross an ocean to commit a terrorist attack,'' as <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingstone </PERSON>, author of several books on terrorism, put it. Still, despite safeguards, bombers have slipped through. Even though their numbers have not been great _ the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> counts seven domestic terror incidents in the last year _ law enforcement officials know the potential for destruction and intimidation of even a single well-placed explosive. -LRB- The <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> bombs blew 2-foot-square steel plates the length of a football field when agents set them off. -RRB- Americans' best protection, authorities say, will come from continued toughening of anti-terror laws and swift justice for those caught. At least as important is intelligence work. In <PERSON> Bolz </PERSON>' words, `` We have to get to know more about the enemy.'' `` We ca n't wait for the bomb to go off,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s counterterrorism chief, <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>, who added agents would use `` whatever resources the judicial system would allow ... -LRB- to -RRB- neutralize a terrorist act before it occurs. Civil liberties groups are watching for overzealousness, something the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> tacitly acknowledged last year in disciplining agents for an undercover probe of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in Solidarity with the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s counterterrorism effort costs tens of millions of dollars annually, said <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>, who declined to be more specific because the budget is classified. `` I always say it's been 95 percent blood, sweat and toil by those agencies involved, but we've had a bit of good luck, too,'' said <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Toensing </PERSON>, a former top terrorism policy official at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. She said the tools of anti-terrorism have improved. There's better cooperation among investigators and prosecutors _ the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, which once balked, she said, now `` has the coffee waiting'' for <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers called to an investigation. And laws have been toughened _ extradition agreements have been revised, and it's now a federal crime to attack an American abroad, she noted. These changes have not halted terror altogether. In 1986 alone, the worst recent year for domestic attacks, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> recorded 24 incidents and nine preventions. In 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s undercover sale of an inert anti-tank rocket to members of the Chicago-based <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Rukns </PERSON> gang led to conspiracy convictions and long prison terms. The government said they had offered to blow up <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> targets for <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. `` A domestic group was willing to commit a terrorist act in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said, `` in order to receive funding from a known state sponsor of international terrorism.'' In <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, members of <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macheteros </ORGANIZATION>, a Puerto Rican separatist group, are on trial now, charged with conspiracy in a violent $ 7 million armed robbery there. And three alleged revolutionaries accused of plotting a series of robberies and bombings, including one that injured 22, are being tried in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. A 1983 explosion 30 feet from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chamber in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Capitol was blamed on a group protesting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy. Security was overhauled. Senators were warned to remove identifying license plates from cars. Seats in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chamber got bulletproof backings. Before and since, groups have detonated explosives at banks, at government offices, under police cars _ from anti-Castro organizations in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to affiliates of the Aryan Nations in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. The tradition of American terrorism goes back to the Weather Underground, to the 19th century coalminer-terrorist `` Molly Maguires'' in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, and beyond. In recent years, the acts and threats have changed the American landscape and lowered Americans' resistance to searches. Security barriers shield the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and other public buildings, and airport scanners, having turned up 41,000 guns since 1973, are a fact of life. Not all of the security gates are closed, however, according to <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kupperman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>: `` If you hit some of the key nodes'' _ gas transmission lines, water systems or electric power grids _ `` you're going to have big trouble.

 In a 1987 mock attack, an Army Special Forces team acting as terrorists symbolically `` knocked out'' power substations, an emergency operations center and valves of the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> said it was tightening security for the oil stored against an embargo. It was no mock attack two years ago when a bomb destroyed an employee's car at the <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livermore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where nuclear weapons are designed. Claiming responsibility was the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a group never heard of before. There is no `` profile'' to use to spot a potential bomber, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said, citing the case of <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Levasseur </PERSON>, on trial now in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> with two others on seditious conspiracy charges. `` Their group began up in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> as some husbands and wives who formed up a leftist terrorist group. ... What identifies them in advance as terrorists? `` Once they began the series of bombings, bank robberies,'' he said, `` there is a series of trails they left. They kept records ..., they kept safe houses. All that has to be methodically pieced together.'' Sometimes the piecing together is beforehand. The decade-old Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court is described as an important anti-terrorism tool. The court, which convenes in a secret room in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> headquarters with judges rotated every two weeks, hears 500 applications a year for electronic surveillance in foreign intelligence, spying and terrorism cases. `` We have never been turned down,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>. It was a FISA court-approved wiretap that alerted <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents to a dynamite bomb aboard a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles-to-Boston </LOCATION> flight in 1982. Three men convicted of conspiracy and transporation of explosives appealed, saying their rights had been violated, but the convictions were upheld. <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuby </PERSON>, is challenging the legality of the search that turned up the bombs in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, saying the government violated his client's rights `` in pursuit of this allegedly higher goal of attacking terrorism.'' Speaking generally, <PERSON> Kuby </PERSON> added: `` When a supposed democracy violates individual civil rights and goes outside the law in order to punish certain individuals, that society loses the moral authority to criticize and condemn the actions of others.'' Such inequity leads to more violence, he said. Some see an inequity in punishing actions, even violent ones, taken for a political cause. Last year, the Greek government declined to extradite a suspected terrorist bomber to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, explaining that he had been acting in the Palestinian `` struggle for ... independence.'' A current case raises the issue again. In 1982, a bomb went off on a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> 747 approaching <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> with 285 passengers aboard. A 16-year-old boy died. A Palestinian indicted in the case, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>, is being held in a Greek jail for a passport violation, and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government wants him extradited for trial here. A decision is pending in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. Ideology is irrelevant when a bomb goes off, said <PERSON> Bolz </PERSON>, the security consultant. `` People can be killed ... no matter what the cause.''

 Here are excerpts from a recent <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> interview with <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>, who heads the counterterrorism section of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION>: AP: An alleged member of the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> was arrested in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> with three bombs last year. Is n't it unusual for overseas terrorists to operate here? <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>: Whether or not that's an aberration, I think it drives home the message that, though the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not had the degree of incidents that we've seen worldwide, certainly the potential is always there for a terrorist incident in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. As long as the causes exist that any given terrorist group may follow, it can happen in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Q: That case boiled down to one alert state trooper. A: One state trooper taking outstanding law enforcement action on a given day with a traffic stop. Faced with that type of law enforcement scrutiny a terrorist organization would be less apt to take an act here. ... The second factor that would tend to minimize the number of terrorist activities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the fact that there is a counterterrorism program. ... The term ` terrorist' tends to glamorize what otherwise is a criminal element. Any criminal organization, they're going to have associates, they're going to have planning, they're going to take overt acts. ... Certainly, to bring weapons in or to bring explosives into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may be a problem; so, they may have to reach out to some element in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to once again bring together enough resources to commit a terrorist act. And in essence what you're doing is putting the pieces of a puzzle together. ... If there is information received that they are affiliated with a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> or, perhaps, any other nationally associated terrorist group, we receive information regarding that, there's the first piece of the puzzle. ... They may assume that they're subject to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government surveillance. Q: If the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> terrorist <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> landed at <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> he could assume _ A: I'd probably be there to shake his hand. I'd love to meet him _ especially here in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. ... If you look at the history of the <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> organization and the violence and suddenness of their attacks at the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> airports _ if we ... were to receive information about their arrival in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, that would receive intense interest in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. Q: ` Intense interest'? A: We ca n't wait for the bomb to go off or for other criminal action to be taken. If we have information which would allow us to neutralize a terrorist act before it occurs, then certainly we'll take it ... Whether it's surveillance, whether it's developing of sources, ... -LRB- or -RRB- working with the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> of any other federal agency or with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, to turn down visa applications if we know a person is dangerous enough. Because it's nice to watch on TV, when someone's able to get just one car-length away from an individual and follow them for an hour show. Surveillance in real life is not as simple. ... Q: In a bomb case in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, the animal-rights activist charged reportedly had no knowledge of bomb-making, and investigators were quoted as saying ` terrorists' may have helped her. Is there a terrorist infrastructure? A: There's not a ` terrorist underground,' per se, in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Are there support networks for foreign-based intelligence groups? Yes. Is there a criminal element to which someone who needed to have a bomb or needed to purchase weapons could go? Obviously there is. Q: What about civil liberties considerations? <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials were disciplined over the investigation of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in Support of the People of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. A: We have to be extremely careful not to concern ourselves with people who just may be saying things which are contrary to the safety or security of American society. Take, for example, ... the young lady up in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> that was apprehended with a bomb. ... There are many people who are truly concerned about animal rights. And the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has no interest in these type of people. However, when someone takes a bomb and attempts to destroy either property or a life in behest of that cause, we would become involved because then it becomes terrorism.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> creates an ethics commission. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornbugh </PERSON> promises tougher securities fraud enforcement. The <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> adds a required course in ethics. As tales of fraud in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s commodities pits and the largest securities fraud scandal ever ring out a decade marked by sleaze in government and business, ethics is being touted as an antidote to immorality. `` A subject like ethics is always important but becomes particularly deserving of emphasis at a time when you seem to have a strong streak of greed running through people's emotions,'' said <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Yavitz </PERSON>, a professor of public policy and business responsibility at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s business school. In one of his first acts, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appointed a panel to recommend ethics reform in government. The move indicates <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to erase the legacy of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, in which 100 officials were accused of unethical behavior. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> _ who replaced <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, himself accused of widespread unethical acts _ said Tuesday the government will create special task forces and hire more investigators targeting securities and commodities fraud. `` They want to get credibility back in the financial markets and they're going to enforce all the rules and regulations to give the markets back to the public,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON>, a futures analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. At the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, a two-year federal inquiry has raised allegations that as many as 100 brokers and traders systematically cheated customers out of millions of dollars In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> recently agreed to plead guilty to six felonies and pay a record $ 650 million in the largest-ever securities fraud probe. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, whose pioneering work in high-yield bonds thrust <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to the forefront of the securities industry, is expected to be indicted Financial and government officials predict the latest moral and legal transgressions will trigger reforms such as stiffer jail terms and fines for white-collar lawbreakers. Both the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> are up for federal reauthorization this year, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is expected to be under pressure to give the agencies greater police power. Some changes may be apparent already. For example, the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> fine was 6 -LCB- times larger than any previous securities fraud settlement. And on Jan. 19, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> fined one trader a record $ 625,000 and his wife _ also a trader _ $ 125,000 for prearranging deals. Both were expelled. In an attempt to reassure viewers that its brokers are ethical, investment giant <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is airing television commercials that conclude with the message `` A Tradition of Trust.'' Most Wall Street brokerage houses now require new employees to sign agreements saying they understand company policies on the handling of sensitive or confidential information. Since reports of endemic insider trading surfaced in 1986 and led to the conviction of speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, brokerage firms have moved to frequently emphasize guidelines. Newly hired college graduates are indoctrinated about behavior deemed immoral or illegal. `` We've updated computer surveillance of transactions to provide faster and more accurate warning signs of trading and brokerage actions within the firm,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, where a 24-year-old junior analyst last year was prosecuted for insider trading. The <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents state securities regulators, wants to require that brokerage firms tell new clients whether a stockbroker has committed any violations. `` That would turn up the heat considerably in terms of people in the industry knowing that information about them was n't just going to stay in some file or computer chip in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> but is there on the table in front of the customer,'' <ORGANIZATION> NASAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Stapf </PERSON> said. Business schools such as <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s, which instituted an ethics class last fall after receiving a $ 20 million endowment from former <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shad </PERSON>, are teaching students that every business decision has social repercussions. `` Schools are responding to it because businesspeople are pressuring them to,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Berkeley </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` The private sector cares very much about this.'' <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akers </PERSON>, writing in the current issue of a <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sloan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> publication, said ethical instruction is fine _ but should begin in kindergarten. `` If an MBA candidate does n't know the difference between honesty and crime, between lying and telling the truth, then business school, in all probability, will not produce a born-again convert,'' <PERSON> Akers </PERSON> said.

 Most business leaders responding to a new survey said foreign investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> helps the economy, creates jobs and increases <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> productive capacity. But one in five nonetheless said the current acceleration in foreign investment threatens <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> social and cultural foundations. The nationwide survey, taken last fall and released Tuesday by the accounting and management consulting firm <ORGANIZATION> Touche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, elicited responses from 519 executives, 30 percent of whom are chief executives. Business leaders tend to support foreign investment more than the general public does, according to a recent survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, a U.S.-Japanese friendship organization that surveyed attitudes toward Japanese investment of people in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Touche </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> cited government statistics that said foreign investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has surpassed $ 1.5 trillion. That figures includes $ 1.3 trillion in portfolio investments such as government securities, bank deposits and corporate stock and $ 262 billion in direct investment in manufacturing plants, banks and real estate. Foreign direct investment alone has more than tripled since 1980, the firm said. The executives were asked to describe the effect of foreign investment on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy and were given three options. The survey said 55 percent said it helps the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy, 31 percent said it creates little cause for alarm and 14 percent said it severely threatens the economy. Among those who felt it threatens the economy, those most concerned were from the Mountain region, while respondents from the Southeast were much less likely than the overall average to express that opinion, the survey said. Twenty-six percent of those responding from the aerospace-defense industry and 21 percent from the retailing business, both higher than average levels, described foreign investment as a severe threat to the economy. <PERSON> Touche </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said that suggests those participating in the survey from the areospace-defense industries are `` understandably more concerned about the effect on national security than is the average respondent.'' It said the higher-than-average response from retailers indicate they may feel `` threatened by the recent barrage of direct foreign acquisitions of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retail operations.'' Last year, the Canadian-based <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 6.6 billion buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was one of 1988's biggest deals. But despite the bullish view that respondents overall took toward foreign investment's effect on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy, the survey said `` a significant number express concern about the effect it has in other areas.'' It said 21 percent of those responding said they felt the acceleration of foreign investment threatens <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> social and cultural foundations. Among some other key findings in the Touche <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> survey of corporate leaders' attitudes: _ Eighty-two percent of the respondents do not want broad protectionist legislation and 82 percent do not think such legislation will become law _ Political stability was cited most frequently as the main reason for the accelerating rate of foreign investment, while favorable exchange rates were cited second _ Eighty-six percent of those responding agree that foreign direct investment has created jobs for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens, and one-third said it had prevented high rates of unemployment during the past five years _ More than two-thirds said foreign direct investment has increased the nation's productive capacity over the past five years More than 80 percent said foreign ownership has either no effect on or improves relations with the labor force. _ Respondents ranked the auto industry as both the industry most helped and the industry most hurt by foreign investment Ranked second among the most helped industries was real estate and second among those most hurt was insurance.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> is planning a seminar for its members to explain racketeering charges that could be leveled as a result of the government's investigation of alleged commodities trading fraud. Former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> will lead the seminar on the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Statute, or RICO, <PERSON> Karsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION> Chairman, said Tuesday. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, who preceded the current <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON>, also will prepare a legal document for the <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors on the parameters of the <ORGANIZATION> RICO </ORGANIZATION> statute, <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> said. The sweeping law, originally designed to wipe out organized crime by taking the profit out of mob activity, has been applied to a variety of cases involving white-collar crime and fraud. `` We have requested Mr. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> to develop this legal memorandum and seminar for our membership in order to clarify misunderstandings surrounding this statute,'' <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> said. He did not give a specific date but said <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s seminar would take place in about two weeks. No charges have been announced, but attorneys for subpoenaed traders say the statute could be used prosecuting those targeted in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> sting operation at the Board of Trade and the rival <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The federal government is reportedly investigating allegations that traders and others systematically cheated investors out of millions of dollars through illegal trading practices. <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials have declined to comment on the investigation. <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION> members at a special meeting Tuesday the exchange may reconsider dual trading and explore electronic trading, two issues that have been hotly debated in light of the investigation, according to sources who attended the meeting. Dual trading, the time-honored right of futures traders to both trade for their own accounts and fill customer orders, is seen by critics as an open door to abuse of the traditional open-outcry style of commodities trading. Electronic trading would use computers to match buy and sell orders, bypassing the 140-year-old `` open-outcry'' system in which traders crowd into recessed `` pits'' to execute trades through a combination of yelling and hand signals. The meeting was the first membership meeting to be called since the disclosure of the probe Jan. 19. The Board of Trade, with about 3,400 members, is the world's largest futures exchange The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> ranks second. Federal authorities have issued more than 200 subpoenas to traders, firms and officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>, seeking information about suspected fraudulent trading at the two exchanges. The Board of Trade issued a statement saying only that it had presented to its membership a series of proposals that may be part of a package of recommendations to be sent to the exchange's board of directors on Feb. 7. But sources who attended the meeting said <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> specifically mentioned dual trading as one of the trading practices that will be examined by a task force drawn from the board of directors. `` And he said the Board of Trade would be remiss if they did not look at electronic trading,'' said a trader who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` I think they're just waking up to reality and smelling the coffee,'' the trader said. `` Sooner or later we're going to have electronic trading.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>, which hopes to launch its <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION> electronic trading system this summer, announced last week it had formed a special panel to review its rules and trading practices.

<HEAD>Company Rejects Arbitration, Cooling-Off Period Set</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After 16 months of fruitless negotiations, the contract dispute between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and its machinists appears to be heading toward a 30-day deadline and a possible walkout by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s largest union. On Tuesday, the financially hurting airline rejected binding arbitration nearly as soon as the offer was made by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. Under the federal board's rule, rejection of binding arbitration by either side leads to a 30-day `` cooling-off period.'' Talks continue with mediators, but if no settlement is reached, the union can strike and the company can impose the conditions of its last contract offer. The mediation board was expected to formally declare an impasse and start the 30-day clock today. Eastern President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> said the deadline pressure could lead to a settlement, but union leader <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said the company wants a walkout. `` They've been spoiling for a strike,'' said <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, president of District 100 of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>. `` We do n't want a strike, but it looks -LRB- like -RRB- we're going to have to accommodate them.'' Bakes said in a statement he was guardedly optimistic a settlement could be reached under deadline pressure. `` A firm deadline is a very real and urgent incentive for both the company and the union to work out differences,'' he said. Company officials said they did not expect a major drop-off in advance bookings because of a potential strike. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON>, Eastern senior vice president for human resources and chief negotiator, wrote to the mediation board _ which entered the talks one year ago _ after receiving a Jan. 31 notice that both sides were being offered arbitration. <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> turned down the offer. <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> wrote, `` In a very real sense, the stakes for Eastern are so fundamental, so very directly tied to whether <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> can survive, that the company can not in such a situation allow a third party -LRB- or an arbitration board -RRB- to make those decisions.'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> has long contended that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, wants to break <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unions and sell its assets. `` They think they have a good chance of breaking the strike. But they've got alternatives and they do n't really seem to care. The attitude is if they destroy the company, so what?'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said. The union leader said Tuesday the two sides met in secret talks directed by mediation board chairman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> for five days starting Jan. 18 in <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, but made little progress. The company, which was seeking $ 150 million in wage concessions from the union, estimates it's losing $ 1 million a day. The machinists, representing mechanics, baggage handlers and other ground service workers, or more than one-fourth of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s employees, were seeking a $ 50 million raise, the company said To soften the impact of the proposed wage cuts, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> said it would provide job security and training programs. Eastern reported $ 233.7 million in losses for the first three quarters of 1988 and has lost more than $ 1 billion in the past decade. Eastern is awaiting completion of a $ 365 million sale of its Northeast shuttle service to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> and has said it must sell other assets to stay afloat unless it can reduce labor costs. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> also owns <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, a non-union carrier.

 <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has intensified its battle against hostile suitor <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> with the filing of a suit charging that <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> broke federal securities laws when it solicited proxies from <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> shareholders. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s suit, filed Tuesday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, came one day after <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> sued the instant photography pioneer to block a proposed $ 1.1 billion stock buyback. Polaroid charged that <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> and other participants in the hostile bid illegally sought proxy votes because they failed to formally notify the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> of their plans, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s suit also charged that <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>, a television and radio concern owned by the <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Disney </PERSON> family, made false and misleading statements in soliciting shareholder proxies. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s $ 45-a-share offer for <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> _ which <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s board has rejected as inadequate _ values the Cambridge-based company at $ 3.2 billion On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> announced its stock buyback proposal and said it was also planning to issue $ 300 million in convertible preferred stock to an investor group, <ORGANIZATION> Corporate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L.P. </ORGANIZATION> Analysts said the plans were a defensive move against the <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, Calif.-based Shamrock, which responded by suing <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> in <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Polaroid is incorporated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> charged in a statement that <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s directors `` breached their fiduciary duties by issuing additional, dilutive voting securities to persons friendly to management in the face of <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s announced intention to wage a proxy contest at <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s upcoming annual meeting. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s suit asked the court to bar the proposed buyback and stock issue. However, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> said the sale of the preferred stock to <ORGANIZATION> Corporate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> had already been completed. In an affidavit, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedrick </PERSON> said stock certificates were delivered Monday to Corporate Partners, the transaction was recorded and payment was made to <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>. Late Tuesday, Judge <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Berger </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> deferred <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s request that she stop <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> from selling stock to Corporate Partners. She gave <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> time to determine whether outstanding conditions remained that would mean the deal between <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Corporate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> was not actually completed. The judge also denied <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s request that Polaroid be required to give five days' notice regarding repurchase of its common stock. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sitrick </PERSON> said the company was studying the ruling and did not have any comment. The two sides are already battling in the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> courts over <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s employee stock ownership plan. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> is appealing a decision that upheld the plan. If the plan is invalidated, <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> says it will boost its offer to $ 3.36 billion, or $ 47 per share. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> has indicated it will wage a proxy fight for control of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s board at the company's annual meeting in May and, if successful, would force the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> either under its offer or any higher third-party bid. Polaroid closed Tuesday at $ 41.62 -LCB-, up $ 1 in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading.

 The involvement of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in the Wall Street insider trading scandal is costing the firm, at least temporarily, its lucrative business with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s casino industry Officials asked the state <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to suspend the investment firm pending a decision on <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s application for a license to do business with the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> casinos, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrillo </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gaming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday. State law prohibits people or companies facing criminal charges from doing business with the casinos, <PERSON> Parrillo </PERSON> said. Because of the huge volume of business <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> conducts with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s heavily-regulated gambling industry, the state asked <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 to apply for a license and undergo the required scrutiny. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> has earned fees totaling more than $ 120 million by marketing securities valued at more than $ 3 billion for <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> casinos in recent years, said <PERSON> Parrillo </PERSON>. The firm itself says it has raised more than $ 2.5 billion in permanent capital for the industry. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> agreed Dec. 21 to plead guilty to six felonies and pay a record $ 650 million in fines and restitution to settle the sweeping securities fraud case brought against it by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The six charges were filed last week. Most of them concern <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s relationship with <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, the former takeover speculator who turned state's evidence in late 1986 after admitting to extensive insider stock trading. `` While criminal charges are outstanding and the -LRB- state's licensing -RRB- investigation continues, any doubt with respect to licensees should be resolved'' before <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> is allowed to continue dealing with the casinos, <PERSON> Parrillo </PERSON> said The gaming division is the investigative arm of the state attorney general's office that deals with the casino industry. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> _ the nation's fifth-largest investment firm _ issued a statement Tuesday expressing confidence the matter would be resolved soon. `` Based on steps <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> is taking and new procedures we will be instituting both at our own initiative and in coordination with various regulatory agencies, we believe that we will be able to qualify for licensure shortly,'' <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> stated. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON> said he could not detail those steps or how they could resolve the pending criminal charges, but he said the firm believed those matters could be addressed. <PERSON> Parrillo </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> had set no hearing date to consider the suspension or to resolve <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s bid for a license. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> has been involved with more than half of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s casinos since the state legalized gambling in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> a decade ago, <PERSON> Parrillo </PERSON> said According to the state's 26-page complaint, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> has given financial advice and raised capital for the holding companies of such casinos as <LOCATION> Caesars </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the Golden Nugget and <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s Claridge Casino Hotel. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> also has been retained by the company belonging to entertainer <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> in its acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Resorts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. One of the six charges filed last week against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> involve <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nugget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a former <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> casino owner <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> allegedly committed mail fraud to manipulate <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> common stock during <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nugget </ORGANIZATION>'s sale of its <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> holdings. Golden Nugget sold its casino to <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in March 1987. Though <PERSON> Drexel </PERSON> was the first, the state has since asked three other investment companies that do business with the casinos to apply for licenses, <PERSON> Parrillo </PERSON> said. They are <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pierce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fenner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co..

<TEXT>
 Now its just Mr. <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>. Today is the first day of the former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's new career as an ordinary citizen. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said he planned to spend `` an extra hour playing with my son,'' <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, 3, followed by breakfast with a prospective employer. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> kept busy right up to the end of his last day in office by attending a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> news conference, but only after <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials vouched for him with wary security guards. Neither <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> nor his interim successor as <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney, <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON>, had their credentials with them when they showed up at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> prosecutors had to wait for other government officials to come downstairs and identify them for security guards, said a chuckling <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, often called the best known prosecutor in the country. The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> press session, was called by Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> to announce the formation of white-collar crime task forces at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney offices around the country. `` This is exactly what we need and what we've needed for some time,'' said <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, who suggested the idea about a year-and-a-half ago. The Southern District of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> has headed since 1983, will gain six attorneys assigned full-time to the task force. Outside the news conference, <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> who made headlines nationwide with his vigorous prosecution on Wall Street crooks, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> mobsters and political grafters, drew a crowd of reporters, eager to learn more about his future plans. As he has done for months, <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> _ often mentioned as a possible Republican mayoral candidate _ spoke much but gave away little. Asked whether he had problems with the demands of the politics _ the glad-handing and parades, <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said with a grin: `` I love parades. I do n't know about all the rest of politics but I love parades.'' `` It seems to me a better idea that given the point that I was at, to put all these things off until the day that I'm a private citizen,'' he said. `` I can feel a lot more comfortable about it starting tomorrow. And I'll be glad to tell you, starting tomorrow, the factors that are involved in deciding what I'm going to do.'' But when a reporter asked, `` How can we reach you, where will you be tomorrow?'' all he said was, `` Pounding the pavement.''

 Stock prices headed lower at midday Wednesday, although they were off the morning's low point. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was off 8.6 points, or 0.4 percent, at 2,043.2 around 12:30 p.m. local time, above the morning low of 2,031.1 but below the early start at 2,051.3. Midday volume totaled 483.4 million shares, compared with 530.5 million the same time Tuesday. Market watchers said it was a healthy sign that the market retreated from its peaks earlier in the week because the market ca n't advance convincingly without a period of rest and consolidation.

 <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has filed a $ 250 million lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, accusing the Japanese video game giant of monopolizing the market with restrictions on its licensed game creators The antitrust suit, filed Tuesday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, alleges that <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> forbids its developers from selling adaptations of their games to other video game companies. `` Developers are faced with the choice between selling games only to <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> customers or not selling,'' according to <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION>'s complaint That restriction causes the creators of video games `` to yield to coercion from <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION>, so that <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION> and other manufacturers of video game consoles are unable to obtain many popular games for use on their own systems,'' the suit claims. The <LOCATION> Sunnyvale </LOCATION>, Calif.-based <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION> is seeking to end <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION>'s alleged practice of prohibiting game developers from writing video games for anyone else, said <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Tropper </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION>'s general counsel The suit, which also names as a defendant <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, is the latest development in a long dispute between <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> and American makers and distributors of video games over the $ 2.3 billion annual market.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that 124 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> airplanes in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> must undergo the same detailed safety inspections ordered for similar airplanes in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The British order, like that issued by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, affects all <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> aircraft built since Dec. 31, 1980. <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> has the most <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> aircraft in the country, 61, but the order also affects 12 smaller domestic and international airlines, said a <ORGANIZATION> CAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom. The American agency told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines Tuesday to inspect all their 741 newer <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s, 747s, 757s and 767s after problems were discovered in 17 aircraft. The order requires the airlines to inspect the planes' engines and cargo compartment fire detection, warning and extinguishing systems for crossed wiring or plumbing. `` In cases like this the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> always pass on the directive to us and we pass it on to the airlines,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> CAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The new order follows earlier <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CAA </ORGANIZATION> directives ordering inspections of specific systems in certain types of aircraft following the Jan. 8 crash of a British <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 in central <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> that killed 46 people.

 Stock prices turned downward in active trading today as traders cashed in some of the market's strong January gains. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 5.89 to 2,336.43 in the first half hour of trading. Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 2 to 1 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 324 up, 602 down and 538 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 34.55 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. Analysts said traders were selling in the belief that the market was due for a pause or period of retrenchment after the 173.75-point rise in the Dow last month. That marked one of the most dramatic gains for January in recent years, surpassed only by a 262.09-point jump at the start of 1987. Analysts also noted some caution over recent evidence of continued strength in the economy. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported this morning that the index of leading economic indicators rose 0.6 percent in December, outpacing many advance estimates. On Friday, monthly statistics from the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> are expected to show a good-sized gain in payroll employment for January. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> climbed 2 to 71 -RCB-. The company reported fourth-quarter earnings of $ 2.18 a share, against $ 1.25 in the like period a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> added -RRB- to 25 -LCB- in the over-the-counter market. <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> posted substantially higher fourth-quarter operating earnings. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks slipped .20 to 166.43.

 Stock prices gained more ground today, bouncing back from an early round of selling. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down about 6 points in the early going, was up 2.68 at 2,345.00 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 6 to 5 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 667 up, 548 down and 569 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 80.97 million shares at midmorning. Analysts said investors were still stepping up to buy each time the market temporarily weakened, eager to seize opportunities to catch up with the rally that lifted the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average 173.75 points last month. That marked one of the most dramatic gains for January in recent years, surpassed only by a 262.09-point jump at the start of 1987. However, brokers also noted some caution over recent evidence of continued strength in the economy. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported this morning that the index of leading economic indicators rose 0.6 percent in December, outpacing many advance estimates.

<TEXT>
 The government's chief economic forecasting gauge rose a healthy 0.6 percent in December after having fallen during the previous month, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said today. The December jump in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, which is designed to predict economic activity six to nine months in the future, followed a 0.2 percent decrease in November and a 0.5 percent rise in October. The index has alternated between dips and gains for the past nine months, which many economists believe is a signal the economy is headed for a slowdown in growth that would help keep inflation in check. `` It tells you that there is not a boom building,'' said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahan </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Kleinwort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` It suggests maybe somewhat slower growth in the next couple of quarters, but it most assuredly does not point to any kind of a recession.'' The economy grew a robust 3.8 percent in 1988, but the slowest quarterly performance in two years was recorded during the October-December period, when the increase in the gross national product was held to an annual rate of 2 percent. Although President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plans to adopt his predecessor's forecast that the economy will grow at a 3.2 percent rate in 1989, many private economists believe the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's predictions for growth, interest rates and inflation were too optimistic. Six of the nine available components of the economic index contributed to December's increase, while two detracted from it. The biggest boost came from an increase in manufacturers' orders for consumer goods. Other business barometers that contributed to the increase were: rising stock prices, more orders for new plants and equipment, rising prices for raw materials signaling a strong demand, increased demand for business permits and growth in the inflation-adjusted money supply. The indictors that made a negative contribution were a shortening in the length of the average work week and an increase in weekly unemployment claims. One indicator, the time needed for companies to receive deliveries from vendors, was unchanged. December's increase left the index at 194.6 percent of its 1967 base of 100. That was up 2 percent from the same month a year earlier. In another economic report released today, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said construction spending shot up 2.5 percent in December, ending a year in which building activity registered its weakest showing since the recession year of 1982. <PERSON> Kahan </PERSON> said construction activity rebounded somewhat toward the end of the year after interest rate increases early in 1988. An easing of economic strength without the threat of recession would be a welcome development for many economists who believe slower growth is needed to keep the economy from overheating and causing a flare-up in inflation. Economist <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said in advance of today's report that the jagged performance of the leading index indicates `` growth is certainly going to slow, but it does n't seem to be predicting any recession at this point.'' `` The fact that it's see-sawing says that the real risk of the economy overheating ... is n't really there anymore,'' she said. `` On the other hand, there's no downturn that extends across the economy.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consulting firm, said before the report was released that if inflation stays under control, `` I do n't see anything else on the horizon that would terminate the recovery.'' `` There is some evidence of slowdown in the economy but not very much,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. `` It's the so-called soft landing approach, which appears to be working effectively.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> since March has been pushing up interest rates to dampen inflationary pressure and slow economic growth. <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told a congressional committee Tuesday that he believed the central bank's efforts to boost interest rates would help prolong the recovery. `` As we enter 1989, there are few signs of any significant impediments to continued expansion,'' he said. The traditional precursor to an economic downturn has been three consecutive declines in the leading index. But while the index has correctly predicted all eight recessions since its creation in 1948, it also falsely forecast four additional recessions. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that, starting with the report for January, it would drop two indicators from the composite index and add two others in an attempt to make it more accurately reflect future economic trends.

 Grain and soybean futures opened mostly lower today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in a wave of selling that puzzled some analysts in light of the strong gains of the previous session. `` It's surprising that we're not getting much follow-through,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON>, a grain-market analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with the G.H. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> division of British-owned <ORGANIZATION> LIT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

The slow pace of export sales also weighed on grain and soybean futures, although <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was said to have purchased 750,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat at market prices. In early trading, wheat was 1 -RCB- cents to 3 cents lower with the contract for delivery in March at $ 4.37 -LCB- a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent to 2 cents lower with March at $ 2.73 -RCB- a bushel; oats were \ cent lower to \ cent higher with March at $ 2.22 a bushel; soybeans were 1 -LCB- cents to 2 -LCB- cents lower with March at $ 7.70 -LCB- a bushel.

 Stock of textbook publisher <ORGANIZATION> Houghton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mifflin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> extended its rise today after surging in the previous session following the disclosure that a group led by <PERSON> Texan </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> boosted its stake to 5.6 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday in disclosing its holdings that its latest purchase was for investment purposes. <PERSON> Houghton </PERSON> <PERSON> Mifflin </PERSON> pointed out that <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> had been an investor in the company for some time and said it found nothing unusual about the filing. But Wall Streeters remembered that it was the <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'s bid last May that started another publishing giant, <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, on the path to a takeover at a price about 80 percent higher than its stock had been trading. In <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading today, <ORGANIZATION> Houghton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mifflin </ORGANIZATION> rose another $ 1.50 a share to $ 46.75 after Tuesday's advance of $ 8.87 -LCB- a share.

Nonetheless, <PERSON> Kassan </PERSON> said the company is vulnerable to a takeover because it has a relatively small amount of its stock in the hands of company insiders and is `` clearly a leader'' in the growing lementary school reading market. In its filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> said it purchased 161,200 shares of <LOCATION> Houghton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mifflin </LOCATION> stock between Jan. 10 and Jan. 27 at a prices ranging from $ 34.21 to $ 36.80 a share.

 Soybean futures prices opened moderately lower today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid profit-taking and new selling linked to an increase in delivery intentions. Corn futures also declined in early trading but wheat was higher, boosted by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to target <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for sales of 1 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat at subsidized prices. The drop in soybean values followed a strong rally late Tuesday afternoon and partly reflected a weakening of bullish enthusiasm due to an increase in the number of notices of intent to deliver soybeans against the March contract. Soybean delivery notices totaled 9.2 million bushels early today, compared with 4.4 million bushels on Tuesday, the first day for traders to post such notices. Corn and wheat delivery notices also increased markedly today but wheat remained firm on indications of increased export business. In addition to the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s offer to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, the agency has targeted <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for additional sales of 2 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat. In early trading, wheat was -RCB- cent to 2 \ cents higher with the contract for delivery in March at $ 4.37 \ a bushel; corn was 1 -LCB- cents lower to -LCB- cent higher with March at $ 2.71 a bushel; oats were -RCB- cent to 1 cent lower with March at $ 2.04 a bushel; soybeans were 6 -LCB- cents lower to -LCB- cent higher with March at $ 7.56 a Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were mostly higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Compaq Achieves Another Milestone: $2 Billion In Revenue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it recorded an 88 percent profit increase in the last quarter of 1988, capping a year in which the personal computer maker became the first start-up company to achieve $ 2 billion in revenue in as little as six years. Just one year earlier, Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> attained $ 1 billion in revenue faster than any company built from scratch. It previously ascended to the ranks of the Fortune 500 in record time. `` Strong worldwide sales of our entire product line contributed both to the year's and to the quarter's strong performance,'' <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Canion </PERSON>, the president and chief executive, said in a statement. International sales, excluding <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, contributed 39 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>'s yearly revenue, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>, founded early in 1982, grew up as a maker of personal computers compatible with <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s line It reached adulthood in 1987 when <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> switched to its Personal System-2 line and <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> chose to stick with the old standard. A front-page headline in a recent issue of Info World, a trade publication, said, `` Compaq Vying To Become the <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> of the'90s.'' That is somewhat of an overstatement: <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> remains nearly 30 times the size of <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>, and its revenue growth alone last year was twice <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>'s overall revenue. Still, at least in the field of personal computers <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> is trying to portray itself as the preserver of industry standards, a role once held by <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>. But <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> remains a formidable rival. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>'s latest challenge is that <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s new PC line is slowly but surely expanding its share of the market, while the extension to the old <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> standard promoted by <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> and other <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> rivals is still on the drawing boards. <PERSON> Canion </PERSON> and his partners began designing their first personal computer in February 1982. Sales began in 1983. When the year was completed they had tallied sales of $ 111.2 million, an American business record. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> reached the Fortune 500 in 1985 and achieved its first billion-dollar year in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> said its earnings in the quarter rose to $ 91.9 million, or $ 2.18 a share, from $ 49 million, or $ 1.25 a share, a year earlier. Revenue jumped 55 percent to $ 668 million from $ 432 million a year earlier. For all of 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> said its earnings rose 87 percent to $ 255 million from $ 136 million a year earlier. Earnings per share rose to $ 6.30 from $ 3.59, or to $ 6.27 from $ 3.57 on a fully diluted basis; that is, assuming conversion into common stock of all convertible securities. Revenue rose 69 percent to $ 2.07 billion from $ 1.22 billion a year earlier.

<HEAD>MCI Earnings Rise Five-Fold In Latest Quarter, Capping `Best Year'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> completed `` the best year in <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION>'s history'' with a five-fold jump in earnings and a 38 percent revenue increase in the last three months of 1988, the long-distance company said Wednesday Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> said it achieved the strong results through a combination of cost controls, new service offerings, a good sales and service organization and the increasing sophistication of its computerized network. <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> spent $ 6 billion over eight years to build its long-distance network, and the huge investment is beginning to pay off by attracting customers, said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Akerson </PERSON>, the chief financial officer. `` We think it was a great quarter and an unbelievable year,'' <PERSON> Akerson </PERSON> said in an interview. <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION>, invading the big-business strongholds of market leader <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said it won contracts over the past year with <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and others. Reflecting the importance of big-business accounts, 1 percent of <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION>'s and <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's customers account for roughly half of their volume of business, <PERSON> Akerson </PERSON> estimated. In contrast to <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION>, the No. 3 long-distance company, <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, has continued to lose money But <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> has trimmed its losses lately and is continuing to increase its volume of business. AT & amp; T makes steady profits from long-distance, but it recorded the first annual loss in its history last year because of a one-time charge to cover the expense of speeding up its conversion to a digital network to meet the competition from <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 122 million, or 46 cents a share, compared to $ 23 million, or 8 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $ 1.43 billion from $ 1.04 billion. For all of 1988, <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> said its earnings shot up to $ 346 million, or $ 1.23 a share, from $ 64 million, or 22 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue jumped 69 percent to $ 5.14 billion from $ 3.94 billion. Charges for early repayment of debt reduced the latest quarter's earnings by $ 10 million and the year-earlier quarter's earnings by $ 14 million, <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> said Offsetting those charges, the company recorded pre-tax gains of $ 12 million in the latest quarter and $ 19 million in the year-earlier quarter from previously negotiated antitrust settlements.

<HEAD>Further Delays Expected in Malaysian Car Exports to United States</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Plans to sell a Malaysian-built car in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have bogged down due to problems with a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> distributor and delays stemming from required regulatory modifications to the vehicle. Through its government-backed <ORGANIZATION> Perusahan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Otomobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> PROTON </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> already has begun exporting locally made cars to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The first 600 Proton Sagas left Tuesday for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Proton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kingdom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> expects to sell 6,000 in the first nine months after the vehicle's March 16 introduction, the firm's managing director, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, said at a sendoff ceremony at <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Klang </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> already has sold a few thousand Proton Sagas in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and originally hoped to begin <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports last year. But modifications needed to meet <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> standards caused a postponement and further delays are likely while problems involving a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> distributor are worked out, industry sources said. <PERSON> Jamil </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamad </PERSON> <PERSON> Jan </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Proton </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday the company might seek arbitration or sue its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> distributor, <ORGANIZATION> Proton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, alleging breach of contract. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> Yugo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, its <ORGANIZATION> Global </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> Proton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> affiliate filed for protection from creditors under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bankruptcy law. <ORGANIZATION> Proton </ORGANIZATION> terminated its distributorship agreement with <ORGANIZATION> PAI </ORGANIZATION> recently because the distributor had failed to obtain necessary federal and state approvals for importing the Saga into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by Nov. 18, 1988, the national news agency <ORGANIZATION> Bernama </ORGANIZATION> reported. Under a November 1987 agreement, <ORGANIZATION> PAI </ORGANIZATION> was to have imported a minimum of 30,000 cars in the first year, and Malaysian <ORGANIZATION> Proton </ORGANIZATION> officials hoped shipments eventually would rise to 100,000 a year. Asked if another company would be appointed distributor for the car in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jamil </PERSON> replied that <ORGANIZATION> Proton </ORGANIZATION> first would have to settle its legal matters with PAI. The regulatory modifications also present an obstacle. <PERSON> Jamil </PERSON> said it took <ORGANIZATION> Proton </ORGANIZATION> 17 months to modify the <ORGANIZATION> Proton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Saga </ORGANIZATION> to meet British regulations. <ORGANIZATION> Proton </ORGANIZATION> officials had estimated it would cost <ORGANIZATION> Proton </ORGANIZATION> $ 10 million to modify plant facilities to make cars that would meet American specifications and another $ 20 million for advertising. The Proton Saga engine and gearbox are made by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION>, but most of its other parts are made in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> The car comes in 1.3 - and 1.5-liter engine versions and retails in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> for $ 9,159 to $ 11,723, depending on equipment The car has been a pet project of Prime Minister <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamad </PERSON> and the company has been operating at a loss. But <PERSON> Jamil </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Proton </ORGANIZATION> was expected to report a profit of between $ 2.56 million and $ 2.93 million for the year ending March 31, 1989. The plant was established at a cost of more than $ 120 million, and first year sales in 1985 amounted to 7,494 cars, 11 percent of all passenger cars sold in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. Last year, 42,500 Proton Sagas were sold here, accounting for 73 percent of the Malaysian market. Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghafar </PERSON> <PERSON> Baba </PERSON> said Tuesday that because of increasing demand, annual production would be increased in October to 110,000 cars from the current 56,000.

<HEAD>Criminal Inquiry Opened In Stock Scandal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The state prosecutor's office opened a criminal inquiry Wednesday into an insider trading scandal involving businessmen with close ties to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s Socialist government. The decision came one day after <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s stock exchange watchdog agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> des </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bourse </ORGANIZATION>, said it found evidence of illegal insider trading in shares of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company <ORGANIZATION> Triangle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> just before its takeover by the French state-owned metals manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Pechiney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>. The commission said it could not identify who leaked valuable information before the deal was announced, and recommended a criminal investigation. <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Boizette </PERSON>, an investigating magistrate attached to the Tribunal of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, was named to lead the probe. The commission said Tuesday it found `` serious, precise and concordant'' indications of illegal activity in the trading of Triangle shares during the few days after <ORGANIZATION> Pechiney </ORGANIZATION> had agreed to an offer of $ 56 per share, but before the deal was announced on Nov. 21. Among the investors who bought Triangle stock at around $ 10 a share, and made quick profits within a week when the price soared, was <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Theret </PERSON>, a businessman with longstanding ties to the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Theret's investment company made purchases that were suspicious, the commission said. Also named in the report was <PERSON> Roger-Patrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelat </PERSON>, one of President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s oldest and closest friends. <PERSON> Pelat </PERSON>, his wife and two sons bought 10,000 shares of Triangle stock on Nov. 16 for the equivalent of about $ 100,000, and resold it in three installments on Nov. 22, 23 and 28, making about $ 450,000. In another development Wednesday, the commission said it opened an investigation into suspected trading irregularities in the shares of the French bank <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>. The investigation will cover trading since June 1, 1988, and will try to establish if there was insider trading or if there was an attempt to manipulate the stock price of the bank. Formerly state-owned, <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> was sold to private investors in 1987 under the privatization program of the conservative government then in power. The Socialists contend that friends of then-Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> were handed control of the bank. The Socialist government, in office since last May, has denied opposition charges that it was behind a takeover attempt on <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> in a covert bid to reestablish state control of the bank. Last month, the government was embarrassed when Industry Minister <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauroux </PERSON>, one of the non-Socialist members of <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, was quoted as saying the <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> affair was `` much more serious'' than the Pechiney-Triangle case and that the stock exchange commission should have investigated it. Even so, <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferge </PERSON> said as recently as Tuesday that no decision to open an inquiry had been made.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> said Wednesday it plans to convert its federal bankruptcy filing from a Chapter 11 reorganization to a Chapter 7 liquidation. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s bankruptcy trustee, said reorganization of the company as a going concern was not feasible, repeating statements previously made by <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> officials and others. Company officials earlier warned stockholders that they would lose their entire investments. Under Chapter 7, a company's assets are liquidated and distributed to satisfy creditors in order of priority.

 Wheat futures led a selloff Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>'s grain and soybean markets, reversing some of the strong gains tallied in the previous session due to supply concerns. The decline in the wheat market was triggered in part by an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> adjustment that effectively moved the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> average cash price for wheat 6 cents closer to $ 4.23 a bushel, a level that would free farmers to sell on the open market wheat they have been storing as part of the government price-support program. `` There was quite a bit of selling on the assumption that once the trigger level is reached, there will be a major sell-off,'' said <PERSON> Katharina </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>, grain market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` But today's slump, of course, means we are moving further away from it,'' she said. Analysts cited profit-taking as a reason for steep losses in the soybean market, where heavy selling late in the session erased more than half of Tuesday's advance. At the close, wheat was 5 -RCB- cents to 7 -LCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in March at $ 4.31 -LCB- a bushel; corn was \ cent to 3 cents lower with March at $ 2.73 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 3 -LCB- cents to 5 cents lower with March at $ 2.17 a bushel; soybeans were 4 -RCB- cents to 9 \ cents lower with March at $ 7.68 a bushel

 Stock prices pulled back a bit in active trading today as traders cashed in some of the market's strong January gains. Analysts said traders were doing some spotty selling in the belief that the market was due for a pause or period of retrenchment after the 173.75-point rise in the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average last month. That marked one of the most dramatic gains for January in recent years, surpassed only by a 262.09-point jump at the start of 1987. Brokers also noted caution over recent evidence of continued strength in the economy. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported this morning that the index of leading economic indicators rose 0.6 percent in December, outpacing many advance estimates. On Friday, monthly statistics from the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> are expected to show a good-sized gain in payroll employment for January.

<HEAD>Better Times Ahead, Chairman Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARL BOHN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> Wednesday predicted that profits during the last year of his leadership will surpass the healthy returns posted in 1988 by the streamlined oil and steel company. `` We just feel extremely confident that 1989 will be a better profit year,'' <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said at his last quarterly news conference before his mandatory rtirement May 31 at age 65. `` That's usually a prediction that I avoid making. So obviously I have a very high level of confidence.'' Higher prices for crude oil, natural gas and steel, coupled with greater sales volume and lower operating costs companywide will enable <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> to surpass the 1988 profits it announced Tuesday, he said. The company had 1988 net income of $ 756 million, or $ 2.62 per share, more than triple the $ 219 million, or 54 cents per share, reported for 1987. Sales rose from $ 14.9 billion to $ 16.9 billion. The 1988 performance was led by a turnaround in steel operations, which posted operating profits of $ 501 million, compared with $ 125 million in 1987. <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said he disagrees with predictions of a slump in steel late this year. `` Everybody's anticipating a slowdown in the second half. They've been saying that for five consecutive years They've been wrong five consecutive years,'' he said. The chairman also is more optimistic about steel industry shipments than even the company's official prediction of 76 million tons. `` My own opinion is it's going to be closer to 77 or 78'' million tons because of continued strength in capital spending, the Gross National Product and employment, he said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steel exports should double from about 500,000 tons last year to a million tons in 1989, <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said. In energy operations, the company's <ORGANIZATION> Marathon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary should benefit from higher crude oil prices, lower exploration costs and the renewal of business in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> unit should enjoy higher natural gas prices and greater sales volume, he said. As it did in 1988, the company will end 1989 with $ 1 billion or more in excess cash, he said. If President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> fails to keep a campaign promise to renew steel import quotas, unfair foreign competition could upset expectations, <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said. `` If anybody has any illusions that these foreign countries -LRB- do n't -RRB- continue to subsidize, forget it. They're doing it on a massive scale,'' he said. `` In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, if they were n't subsidized, they's all go belly up. He said the European Common Market recently permitted the Italian government to grant $ 6 billion in subsidies to that nation's steel industry. Steel shipments by <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> will increase from 12.2 million tons in 1988 to 13 million tons or more this year, he said. The gains are expected even though 1988 operating profits were only around $ 45 per ton when <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> had predicted $ 60 per ton. He blamed the collapse of demand for tubular steel used in oil and gas exploration, an unintended rise in steelmaking costs, equipment problems, and accounting errors. Most of those problems will disappear in 1989, <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Corry </PERSON>, elected this week to succeed <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> on June 1, said one of the biggest challenges facing him concerns the ability of the company's smaller, leaner steel operation to weather a recession. `` We have n't tested ourselves in the new configuration yet in a down cycle,'' <PERSON> Corry </PERSON> said after the news conference. `` I have n't made up my mind yet whether the steel industry can lose the kind of money it lost in 1982 and'83'' without companies failing.

<HEAD>Knight-Ridder Profit Down 8.8 Percent In Fourth Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday posted an 8.8 percent decline in its fourth quarter earnings, due partly to a one-time charge for costs in the implementation of its joint newspaper operating agreement in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. The media company said that in the three months ended Dec. 31 it had a profit of $ 45.6 million, or 76 cents a share, compared with $ 50 million, or 83 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. Total operating revenue rose to $ 574.6 million in the quarter from $ 527.1 million in fourth quarter 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> set aside $ 13 million for anticipated severance and other costs related to the joint operating agreement between its <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> Opponents of the partial merger asked a federal appeals court Wednesday to delay the deal. Annual earnings rose to $ 156.4 million, or $ 2.76 a share, compared with $ 155.2 million, or $ 2.65 a share, in 1987. Operating revenue rose to $ 2.08 billion from $ 1.97 billion the previous year. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION>'s chief financial officer, said unfavorable factors affecting annual results included a decline in newspaper advertising lineage that affected the entire industry, an average 13 percent rise in newsprint costs and declining profitability at its <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION>'s newspaper division, with 30 daily newspapers, showed an operating profit of $ 299.73 million, down 8.1 percent from $ 326.19 million in 1987.

 Energy futures prices rose in moderate trading Wednesday, buoyed by technical factors and growing investor confidence in <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>, market watchers said. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the March contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, settled 48 cents higher at $ 17.51 a barrel after falling 26 cents in the previous session. Other contract months also rose. Among refined products, the March contract for unleaded gasoline rose 1.34 cents to close the day at 49.63 cents a gallon, while domestic heating oil increased 1.04 cents to 50.44 cents a gallon. Other contract months also advanced. Analysts said that after a weak start prices rose despite the lack of new news to spur prices. `` There was no real fundamental change in the market,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Redoglia </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION>. `` The market is going through a consolidation phase.'' The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>'s weekly report on oil supplies was neutral to bearish for prices, traders said. The report, released after the close of trading on Tuesday, showed crude stocks were down slightly while gasoline supplies rose and heating oil was mostly unchanged. Analysts said prices got some strength from continued investor confidence that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> will follow through on its pledge to lower production. The agreement by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which took effect Jan. 1 and extends for six months, set a quota of 18.5 million barrels a day, more than 3 million barrels a day less than the cartel was producing late last year. Crude oil prices have risen more than $ 3 a barrel since the new quota was announced last November. Prices had fallen sharply during most of 1988. `` There was nothing fundamentally new today other than growing confidence that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> is serious about what it wanted to do,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Treasury Schedules $28.75 Billion Borrowing Package</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday it plans to borrow $ 28.75 billion next week to replenish the government's coffers in a giant debt auction which will feature a sale of 30-year bonds for the first time since last May. Every three months, the government holds three debt sales to finance the $ 2.7 trillion national debt. The auction, known as a quarterly refunding, features the sale of three-year notes, 10-year notes and 30-year bonds. The government, however, was prevented from offering any 30-year bonds at the last two quarterly auctions because of a failure by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to raise the ceiling on issuance of long-term debt. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> finally passed new legislation before it adjourned late last year and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bremner </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> deputy assistant secretary for finance, said the 30-year bonds would be a part of next week's auction At a briefing for reporters, <PERSON> Bremner </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> still expected to have enough total borrowing authority to finance the national debt at least until next summer. Many in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> expect the government to bump up against the current $ 2.8 trillion debt limit sometime in August, but <PERSON> Bremner </PERSON> refused to be specific about the month. `` All things being equal, we expect to make it through without difficulty until the summer,'' he said. The battle over increasing the debt limit is expected by many in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to be a major showdown with the new administration over budget priorities since without legislation to boost the borrowing authority, the government would face the prospect of missing such necessary payments as the monthly Social Security benefits. The auctions for next week call for: _ $ 9.75 billion in three-year notes in minimum denominations of $ 5,000 to be auctioned Tuesday. _ $ 9.5 billion in 10-year notes in minimum denominations of $ 1,000 to be auctioned on Wednesday. _ $ 9.5 billion in 30-year bonds in minimum denominations of $ 1,000 to be auctioned on Thursday.

 The battle for textile giant <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> heated up Wednesday as <ORGANIZATION> Farley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> sweetened its hostile tender offer to $ 1.53 billion. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said it would pay $ 52 per share in cash for <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> stock, up from its initial $ 48-per-share, or $ 1.4 billion, offer on Oct. 24. The bid, which had been set to expire at midnight Wednesday, also was extended until midnight Feb. 15. A <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> spokesman said the company would have no comment on the latest offer. `` We have not yet received this proposal and the board of directors will consider it in due course,'' he said. On Wall Street, meanwhile, trading in <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> stock was active. It closed at $ 53.25 a share Wednesday, up $ 2.50. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>, the nation's largest publicly traded textile company, manufactures such products as Martex sheets and towels and Gold Toe socks. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, one of the nation's largest privately owned conglomerates, controls <ORGANIZATION> Fruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's biggest underwear manufacturer, and <ORGANIZATION> Acme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, whose brands include Acme and Dingo boots In a statement from its <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> headquarters, <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> said the increased bid `` once again demonstrates our resolve to acquire <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point-Pepperell </LOCATION>.'' The offer is conditional on receiving, or owning outright, two-thirds of the outstanding shares. The conglomerate already controls 2.9 million shares and has received offers for another 15.7 million, which together account for about of 62 percent of <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> stock. The move is the latest in a series of events that began last Friday, when <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> _ which has consistently fought <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> _ said it was talking with third parties who might be interested in purchasing the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, Ga.-based company. In a filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> said it was not for sale, but `` has entered into preliminary negotiations with various third parties who have expressed an interest in a transaction involving the company.'' <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> also suggested it might undertake a recapitalization, which analysts believe would leave the company in the hands of current management. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Raymond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s announcement Wednesday likely was a direct response to <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s search for a `` white knight.'' <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> has claimed from the beginning that <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s offer was an attempt to purchase the company before its stock could reflect last year's acquisition of the bulk of competitor <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stevens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, giving <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> about a quarter of the nation's home fashion textile market Ms. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> and other analysts estimated <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION>'s stock is worth in the $ 55 range. Analysts long have expected a higher offer in the <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> deal, which also has been caught up in court and legislative battles since its inception. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s board voted in November to resist <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s overture. It went to the extent of holding a football-style pep rally at a high school stadium in <LOCATION> Lanett </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, where Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> told a cheering crowd, `` Our determination is to whip <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>. We are going to fight <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> until hell freezes over, and then we are going to fight him on the ice.'' After <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> won a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that some of <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION>'s `` poison pill'' anti-takeover defenses were not allowed by state law, a state legislator introduced a bill in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> that would speed up the effective date of laws allowing the provisions The bill won approval in the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and currently is awaiting action in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where a committee has recommended approval. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> has appealed the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling to the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, where a decision is pending. Also pending is a ruling from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Tidwell </PERSON> on <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s claim that the state's anti-takeover law is unconstitutional. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s offer includes conditions that <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s anti-takeover defenses be voided.

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> notified money-losing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and its militant <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union Wednesday that a 30-day clock is about to start ticking on their stalled contract talks. Meanwhile, there were signs that some air travelers were rethinking their flight plans with a potential strike looming. <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> formally rejected binding arbitration Wednesday to resolve the 16-month impasse, but the union was willing to submit, board Chairman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> announced in a news release from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` There can be no change in rates of pay, rules or working conditions or established practices in effect prior to the time the dispute arose, nor does the union have the right to strike during this 30-day period,'' said <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>. The 30-day cooling-off period begins Thursday and expires at midnight March 3. Both sides say salaries are the major remaining issue. Eastern is asking the 8,500-member <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union to take $ 150 million in pay cuts, but the union wants $ 50 million in raises. Federal mediator <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerjan </PERSON> said every effort would be made to resolve the dispute during round-the-clock sessions. Meanwhile, some travelers were showing signs they are concerned about a possible disruption in air service by the Miami-based carrier. Eastern was taken over three years ago by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which also owns non-union <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Flying through <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on his way home to <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, from vacation in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said a strike `` would be a major problem. We're already having problems in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> with them wanting to raise the tariffs and slow down the smaller traffic to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, so if Eastern goes on strike that could be a real problem for us.'' <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Geller </PERSON>, a transportation analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Provident </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s latest moves could have negative repercussions for the airline. `` People that have scheduled flights for 30 days from now will at least to some degree change their flight plans,'' he said. `` The traveling public goes, ` Why take the chance?''' Eastern President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> said in a statement Tuesday that he is `` guardedly optimistic'' a settlement can be reached under deadline pressure.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Plunge As Chilean Refinery Strike Is Averted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Copper futures prices tumbled Wednesday following news that a labor agreement had averted a strike at a large, state-owned Chilean copper refinery. On other markets, precious metals rebounded, grains and soybeans fell; energy futures rose; and livestock and meat futures were mixed. Copper settled 1.05 cents to 6.60 cents lower on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with the contract for delivery in March at $ 1.363 a pound The sell-off was triggered mainly by reports that workers at <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Empresa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mineria </ORGANIZATION> smelter-refinery had reached a settlement with the government, eliminating prospects for a strike on Friday. The facility refines 200,000 metric tons of copper per year, or about 15 percent of the total production in the world's leading copper-producing country. `` That's a lot of copper,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON>, a metals-market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` If that refinery was n't operational it would be a significant factor in the market.'' <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s copper production already has been crippled by the Jan. 13 shutdown of smelting operations at <ORGANIZATION> Codelco </ORGANIZATION>'s Chuquicamata mine, the world's largest copper mine. The smelter was shut down after an explosion and is not expected to resume operations for another month. Mechanical and labor problems in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and some of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s major copper-producing nation's have contributed to recent strong gains in the copper market The spot price of copper on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> reached a record $ 1.6475 a pound on Dec. 8. Gold and silver futures prices advanced moderately on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after four days of sharp losses that had sent prices to their lowest levels since last October. Gold settled $ 1.40 to $ 2.10 higher with February at $ 393.70 a troy ounce; silver was 3.5 cents to 4.4 cents higher with February at $ 5.835 a troy ounce. Wheat futures led a sell-off on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>'s grain and soybean markets, reversing some of the strong gains tallied in the previous session and highlighting supply concerns The decline in the wheat market was triggered in part by an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> adjustment that effectively moved the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> average cash price for wheat 6 cents closer to $ 4.23 a bushel, a level that would free farmers to sell on the open market wheat they have been storing as part of the government price-support program. Traders sold wheat contracts in anticipation of a major sell-off if the $ 4.23 level is reached and new supplies come onto the market. Analysts cited profit-taking as a reason for steep losses in the soybean market, where heavy selling late in the session erased more than half of Tuesday's advance. Wheat settled 6 cents to 8 -RCB- cents lower with March at $ 4.31 -RCB- a bushel; corn was \ cent to 2 -RCB- cents lower with March at $ 2.73 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 3 -LCB- cents to 5 cents lower with March at $ 2.17 a bushel; soybeans were 5 cents to 9 -LCB- cents lower with March at $ 7.67 -LCB- a bushel. Energy futures prices rose in moderate trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, buoyed by technical factors and growing investor confidence in <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled .48 cent to .59 cent higher with March at $ 17.51 a barrel; heating oil was 1.04 cents to 1.27 cents higher with March at 50.44 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.34 cents to 1.74 cents higher with March at 49.63 cents a gallon. Cattle futures settled mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with support stemming from fears of weight losses and deaths from bitterly cold weather in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, and selling linked to profit-taking after a recent run-up in prices. Hog futures prices rose on fears that cold weather in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> would slow the movement of hogs to market, while pork-belly futures fell on scattered profit-taking. Live cattle settled .12 cent lower to .35 cent higher with February at 75.07 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .28 cent higher with March at 84.75 cents a pound; live hogs were .12 cent to .50 cent higher with February at 43.62 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .30 cent lower to .93 cent higher with February at 39.45 cents a pound.

 The dollar finished higher against most major currencies Wednesday in a late surge of buying. Gold prices ended higher in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> after declining overseas. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid price for gold of $ 391.50 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, up from $ 390.80 late Tuesday. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency started the day by advancing in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, but later turned mixed in nervous European trading as the markets awaited results of Friday's meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the seven major industrialized nations. In late afternoon trading in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar suddenly shot up, finishing at its highs for the day. `` Some dollar demand came out of the blue,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, vice president of foreign exchange at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Analysts said they were n't certain what inspired the last-minute dollar buying. Some, like <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, suggested that it could have reflected Japanese investors' interest in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s upcoming quarterly refunding. The auctions of <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, used to help finance the federal debt, often spur foreign investors to buy dollars in advance to pay for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> securities. Whatever the reason, the dollar's late surge had a snowball effect and brought more buyers into the market, traders said. `` Probably a little bit of panic set in,'' suggested <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dallow </PERSON>, a currency analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Dealers said they expect the dollar to trade in a narrow range ahead of Friday's meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of the Group of Seven and the release that day of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment figures for January. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar surged 1.27 Japanese yen to a closing 130.40 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted lower at 129.60 yen. By the close of trading in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar had risen to 130.33 yen from 130.13 yen late Tuesday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost $ 1.7500 to buy one pound, cheaper than $ 1.7535 late Tuesday. In late <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading, the pound was quoted at $ 1.7470, down from $ 1.7531 late Tuesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.8753 West German marks, down from 1.8767; 1.5960 Swiss francs, down from 1.5978; 6.3845 French francs, up from 6.3743; 1,370.50 Italian lire, down from 1,371.30; and 1.1900 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1830 Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.8725 West German marks, up from 1.8710; 1.5845 Swiss francs, down from 1.5985; 6.3600 French francs, up from 6.3580; 2.1080 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1100; 1,367.50 Italian lire, up from 1,365.00; and 1.1895 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1840 Gold fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 393 a troy ounce, compared with late Tuesday's $ 394.25. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, gold was lower, closing at a bid of $ 392.75 compared with $ 394.20 late Tuesday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 4.25 to close at a bid $ 392.30. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold for current delivery rose to $ 393.70 an ounce from $ 391.60 late Tuesday. Silver bullion prices were unchanged on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market where the metal was trading at a late bid price of $ 5.85 a troy ounce. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Comex, silver for current delivery rose to $ 5.835 an ounce from $ 5.792 late Tuesday.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it rejected an offer to postpone all litigation stemming from <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 2.6 billion takeover bid because <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> was `` demanding an advantage'' over other possible buyers. Coastal officials said they offered not to purchase any <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> stock before March 15. In exchange, <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> sought a guarantee it would be treated fairly in the bidding process and that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> would erect no new obstacles to a tender offer after that date. `` We are disappointed that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> refused to agree to treat Coastal fairly and not to enact any new poison pill,'' Coastal President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said. In response, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> said the company is `` perfectly willing to include Coastal in the bidding process for <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> on the same basis as other bidders.'' `` However, Coastal was demanding an advantage over other bidders and attempting to limit our ability to properly act in the best interest of our shareholders,'' the statement said. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s board last Sunday rejected <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 42-a-share offer as inadequate and urged shareholders to wait for a better price. Litigation relating to <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION>'s attempted takeover has spread to three courts, including the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> where <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> sought to block <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> from enacting its poison pill plan elsewhere.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ryder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday that it will buy back up to 15 percent of its stock and is considering selling four subsidiaries to refocus on its core transportation businesses. The move was welcomed on <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, where Ryder stock rose $ 1.125 to close at $ 28.125 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is very good news for the stock, good news for the company,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Geller </PERSON>, a transportation analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Provident </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. The planned 2-year repurchase of up to 12 million of its 80 million outstanding shares would cost the transportation and insurance company around $ 324 million, based on Tuesday's closing price of $ 27 a share. But Miami-based Ryder expects to make a net gain of more than $ 100 million by selling units that represent less than 5 percent of its total assets, said <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, Ryder's chairman, president and chief executive officer. `` We are selling businesses that have n't met our financial objectives,'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said in a statement. The investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has been engaged to explore the possible sale of <ORGANIZATION> Ryder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION>, which includes managing general insurance agencies in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, two reinsurance companies and a reinsurance broker. `` While the division has been a quality provider of services to the insurance market and a good profit contributor, it does not have an important strategic fit with Ryder System's core business and is probably more valuable to another company,'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said. The company also is considering the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Ryder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a freight forwarding and customs brokerage company; <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Packing and <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a freight assembly and distribution company; and Ryder Freight System, a full-truckload common carrier. `` We want to put a sharper focus on growing our highway transportation and aviation services core businesses,'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said. `` These other businesses probably have more value and a brighter future in the hands of other owners.'' The moves continue efforts that started six months ago to reduce costs and improve asset utilization, Ryder said. Nearly 900 people have been laid off out of a total workforce of 43,000, the number of <ORGANIZATION> Ryder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Truck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rental </ORGANIZATION> district offices has been cut from 105 to 97, and the <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION>, which leases planes, has been split in two. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said no new layoffs are expected. Ryder's aircraft leasing business is by far its fastest-growing sector, and its vehicle leasing also accounts for a large share of revenue, <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> said. `` The other parts of their business are solidly profitable but did n't really fit with the rest of these other services,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalmbach </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> also welcomed the Ryder moves. `` The end result will be a somewhat smaller company with a narrower focus, disposing of companies that are not individually very large and do not mean that much to the company in the long run,'' he said. The stock buyback, to be arranged by <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, will begin after Ryder announces its 1988 financial results later this month and will be financed through borrowing, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Bill Would Abolish Fuel-Economy Standards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Legislation to abolish federal fuel-economy standards was introduced Wednesday by Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>, D-Mich., who argued that the rules cause the economy to suffer in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and the nation <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>'s bill, which he first introduced last year, would end the corporate average fuel-economy regulations that require automakers to attain a certain minimum gasoline mileage on average throughout their fleets of passenger cars. `` CAFE is a government regulation that is simply not needed,'' said <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>. `` The time has come to put it aside. Without such a change, the two largest domestic automakers face the unfortunate prospect of having to limit or stop selling some of the most popular cars in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> today.'' The fuel-economy standard for 1989 models is 26.5 miles per gallon, a slightly more stringent level than the 26 mpg standard in effect from 1986 through 1988 but below the 27.5 mpg set as a goal by fuel-conservation legislation. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is considering what standard to set for 1990 models. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s new transportation secretary, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee this week he would review any mileage standard set by <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>'s bill died last year without action by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, whose chairman, Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, also a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Democrat, has said the fuel-economy standards appeared to be working fairly well. <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> has yet to take a position on the new legislation <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> introduced Wednesday, the committee staff said. `` It's an educational process,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Eller </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> aide, when asked about prospects for the bill this year. `` We now have a base of members who understand why CAFE should be abolished.'' <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> have argued for an end to the fuel-economy standards, saying it forces them to produce smaller cars the buying public does n't want in order to bring their fleets within the mileage requirements. The result, they have said, is layoffs at large-car assembly plants and a lessened ability of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers to compete with small-body imports. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, with a higher proportion of smaller vehicles in its lineup, has said it can meet the 27.5 mpg standard envisioned by the law.

 The government proposed a ban Wednesday on a chemical that makes apples appear more appealing and last longer, citing `` an inescapable and direct'' link to cancer that during a lifetime could cause five deaths for every 100,000 people exposed. While the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the cancer risk is not high enough to warrant an emergency action to remove the chemical from the market, it urged its manufacturer to withdraw the chemical until a final regulation banning the chemical can be issued. Officials said formal agency action ordering the chemical withdrawn will not likely come for another 18 months and then is likely to be challenged, a process that could take another one year to three years. The object of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s concern is a growth control chemical called daminozide, which is sold by the trade-name Alar. The chemical is absorbed by the fruit and has been used by apple growers since the early 1970s to spur even growth, reduce spoilage and help preserve apples so they can be sold all year. Alar's manufacturter, <ORGANIZATION> Uniroyal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemcial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Middlebury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, immediately challenged the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> findings and promised to contest any government ban. The company said it would not withdraw its product voluntarily. `` We do n't see any basis for taking -LRB- Alar -RRB- off the market,'' <ORGANIZATION> Uniroyal </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Yanis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bibelnieks </PERSON> said. `` All of the studies that have been done since 1985 have supported our position that Alar poses no signficiant health risk.'' He said it was `` inappropriate to make any judgment based on interim results'' cited by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bibelnieks </PERSON> said Alar production has been reduced by about 75 percent since 1985 because of the health controversy which began in 1977 when it was first thought the chemical might cause cancer. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> sought to ban the chemical three years ago, but held off because of disputes about the validity of test data. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> and industry estimated that today only about 5 percent of the country's 200 million-bushel apple crop is sprayed with Alar, compared with as much as 35 percent in the early 1980s. In recent years many processors and some grocery chains have refused to buy Alar-treated apples because of the health concerns. Authorities have said the threat is greatest for young children who consume large amounts of apples, usually in processed form as juice or sauce. A lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which has filed a lawsuit seeking to stop Alar's use, criticized the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> for not taking emergency action to ban the product immediately. `` The debate ought to occur while the chemical is n't on the market,'' said <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Hathaway </PERSON>, the attorney for the Washington-based group. Apple growers in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, meanwhile, said they were disappointed at the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> position and that they had hoped the agency would give Alar its stamp of approval. But <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said the growers likely will voluntarily curtail Alar's user further. `` We know it's a great tool for us to use, but by the same token if it's going to hurt our image we do n't need it,'' he said The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that interim results from new studies on test animals show in some cases the development of cancerous tumors after exposure to daminozide. `` There is an inescapable and direct correlation between exposure to <ORGANIZATION> UDMU </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- a form of daminozide -RRB- and the development of life-threatening tumors in test mice,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s acting administrator. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimated the chances of an adult getting cancer as a result of Alar exposure from eating apples and apple products at five in 100,000, but it said the lifetime risk is higher for young children because of their greater use of apple products. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said it will begin the formal rulemaking for such a ban within 90 days and anticipates issuing a final regulation taking Alar off the market within 18 months. Officials acknowledged, however, that the process could take much longer if it is contested. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said the agency could seek an emergency suspension that would order Alar off the market within months, but he said the agency rejected such an action because of the continuing conflicting test data, the fact that the tests have not been completed and because of the level of risk. He said that during the 18 months until a final ban is expected the risk of an adult getting cancer as a result of Alar exposure is at most one in 1 million, and the risk for a child nine in 1 million. `` We do n't think that the added burden of risk -LRB- over the next 18 months -RRB- is of sufficient magnitude to warrant this kind of -LRB- emergency -RRB- action,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Derl </PERSON> <PERSON> Derr </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 90 percent of the country's apple growers, said Alar has enabled growers to provide `` the top quality and moderately priced apples they desire'' because it allows apples to remain on trees longer, keeps them firmer, delays internal decay and prolongs shelf life.

 A special committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> named the president of the futures industry's self-regulatory organization to advise the panel in its review of trading practices targeted by a sweeping federal fraud investigation The nine-member committee appointed <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilmouth </PERSON>, president of the Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, to assist in the review of trading procedure and policy, said <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Yemma </PERSON>. The committee held its first meeting Wednesday, a closed session expected to be the first in a series to discuss trading rules and procedures. Separately, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> the staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> recommended approval of the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION> electronic trading system, a key element in the exchange's move to set up after-hours global futures trading Electronic trading also is seen by some as helping police improper activity by more closely monitoring deals. The commission, the federal agency that regulates the futures industry, was expected to vote on the proposal Thursday. Also, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> designated Rep. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> English, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., to direct a congressional investigation into trading practices in the futures and options markets English, chairman of the panel's subcommittee on conservation, credit and rural development, said the probe would focus on the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>'s regulation of the markets and on the self-regulating ability of the markets themselves. The <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> established its review panel following disclosure of a two-year undercover federal probe of alleged widespread fraud and illegal trading practices in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> futures markets. One practice under increasing scrutiny has been dual trading, in which traders can buy and sell for themselves and their customers simultaneously. The longtime practice is legal but critics say it invites abuse of the traditional open-outcry style of commodities trading, in which traders use shouts and hand signals to buy and sell futures contracts in exchange trading pits. <PERSON> Karsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, indicated at a closed traders meeting Tuesday that the exchange may reassess dual trading in light of the burgeoning scandal. And in Wednesday's editions, the Wall Street Journal reported that ABS Partners, widely regarded as the most powerful group of brokers at the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>, has banned dual trading by its members to avoid `` an appearance of conflict of interest.'' None of the ABS traders returned telephone requests Wednesday afternoon for comment on the report. Such a move would be a further indication of how key futures market players may be trying to forestall possibly stronger government restrictions of their business in the wake of the fraud probe. It also may indicate how dual trading could end up as the scapegoat of any attempted in-house damage control, much as computerized program trading became the target of voluntary restrictions among a number of major Wall Street firms following the October 1987 stock market crash. Broker groups such as ABS employ brokers in different exchange trading pits _ where commodities futures contracts are actually bought and sold _ and split losses and profits with their members. ABS Partners includes 24 brokers and other members and is controlled by <PERSON> Maury </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravitz </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaulentis </PERSON>, two of the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>'s wealthiest and most powerful brokers, the Journal reported. <PERSON> Kravitz </PERSON> is a longtime friend and former law partner of <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON>, the powerful chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>'s executive committee and a key figure in the exchange's growth in financial futures trading, the newspaper stated. In endorsing approval of the <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION> system, the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> staff recommended that <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION> trading initialy be limited to futures contracts on the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, West German mark, Swiss franc, Japanese yen, Eurodollar, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills and gold. <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION>, developed by <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, is an electronic system which beginning this fall would be used before and after regular exchange hours. Eventually, all of the exchange's contracts would be eligible for <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION> trading.

 <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reportedly has asked nine <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pressure the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> into reducing proposed settlement terms in its fraud case. Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> was a key player in the lobbying effort, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday, by persuading the congressional delegation from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to intervene on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>. The result was three similarly worded letters from members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> demanding that the agency abandon efforts to force <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to move its high-yield bond department from <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> to the firm's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> headquarters, the Times said. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., and Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., each wrote letters on <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s behalf and Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> D-Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION>, wrote a third letter signed by six other <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles-area </LOCATION> lawmakers, the report The six congressmen were identified as Reps. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreier </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Moorhead </PERSON>, <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>. At least seven of the nine members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have received campaign contributions or honorariums from <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, the Times said. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> representatives asked the three members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to express objections to an <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> demand that the firm move its so-called `` junk bond'' high-yield operation which had been headed by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, the key target of the federal fraud investigation. The firm has said that dismantling the junk bond unit would severely hurt <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s leading role in the lucrative market for these securities, commonly used to finance takeovers or finance growth of small and medium-size takeovers. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> agreed Dec. 21 to pay the government $ 650 million in fines and restitution and plead guilty to six felonies to settle accusations of securities fraud. The plea bargain also requires <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to settle related litigation with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, which filed civil fraud charges against the firm last Sept. 7.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> agreed Wednesday to pay the government $ 205 million, including interest, to settle allegations that a subsidiary violated federal oil and gas price control rules in the late 1970s. The company also reported its financial results which showed that a $ 45 million provision for the settlement deeply eroded fourth-quarter income. But for all of last year <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION>'s profit rose 26 percent, despite the cost of the settlement and of lost production caused by the explosion of an <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> oil and gas platform in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> that killed 167. Fourth-quarter profit declined to $ 7 million, or 2 cents a share, from $ 38 million, or 17 cents a share, a year earlier, largely because of the provision for the settlement. Sales in the quarter were $ 5.3 billion, up from $ 4.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 302 million, or $ 1.21 a share, in 1988, up from $ 240 million, or $ 1.06 a share, the previous year. Sales for the year were $ 19.4 billion, up from $ 17.1 billion in 1987. As to the settlement, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> originally sought $ 700 million from <ORGANIZATION> Oxy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Oxy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> is the former <ORGANIZATION> Cities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> bought in 1982, after the alleged violations occurred In settling the administrative case against it, <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> did n't admit violating department regulations The allegations involve actions taken from October 1979 through January 1981 and were brought under federal price controls on oil and gas imposed after the Arab oil embargo. The Energy Department press office did n't immediately respond to questions about the settlement. The company agreed to pay $ 150 million, plus 10 percent interest, over the course of eight years, bringing the total to $ 205 million. A first payment of $ 40 million will be made when the settlement agreement becomes final, a process that involves publishing the terms in the Federal Register and a 30-day period for comment by interested parties. The balance of the settlement is to be paid, with 10.02 percent interest, in eight annual payments of $ 20.6 million. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION>'s financial results, like those at other big oil companies, were boosted by strong gains on petrochemicals even though oil and gas prices were depressed. The company, which bought <ORGANIZATION> Cain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> last year, recorded chemical sales of $ 1.4 billion in 1988, up from $ 780 million the year before. Sales at the <ORGANIZATION> IBP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> meat-processing subsidiary rose to $ 2.4 billion from $ 2 billion, and natural gas transmission revenue rose to $ 733 million from $ 588 million. Oil and gas sales declined to $ 701 million from $ 917 million. The company did n't reveal the exact cost of lost production from the July 6 explosion that destroyed <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> platform in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> Aberdeen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> executives previously said it would cut year-end profit by between $ 13 million and $ 26 million.

<HEAD>Say Consumer Confidence Dropped In January</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumer confidence in the economy, which sharply improved in December, relinquished some of the gain in January, the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. The board's Consumer Confidence Index, a mathematical calculation designed to reflect sentiment about buying plans and borrowing, retreated to 115.3 last month, a four-point loss from a month earlier. `` The modest decline in the measure of confidence in January represents some cooling of the enthusiasm registered in December following the presidential election,'' said <PERSON> Fabian </PERSON> <PERSON> Linden </PERSON>, head of the board's consumer research unit. `` Still, while the most recent readings represent some retreat from the month before, they remain comfortably strong.'' At the same time, <PERSON> Linden </PERSON> said, the January decline shows `` there apparently is some moderate apprehension about the future, as the nation's prime economic problems _ the two deficits and the savings and loan crisis _ increasingly become major issues in the public debate.'' The index is derived from a monthly survey, covering 5,000 households nationwide, conducted for the board by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toledo </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The index uses a 1985 base of 100. Buying plans fell for all major categories included in the survey. Plans to buy cars fell to 6.8 percent from 7.4 percent a month earlier. Concern about rising interest rates contributed to a 1 percentage point drop in home-buying plans to 2.8 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> is a New York-based network of executives that supports management and economic research.

 Appliance maker <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that competitive pressure on its sales volume and prices caused its first-quarter profits to fall 75 percent. The company, which is reorganizing under federal bankruptcy laws and which has attracted the interest of potential buyers, earned $ 1.8 million during its first quarter, down from $ 7.2 million a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s first-quarter profit translated to a per-share loss after dividend requirements. It also suffered a per-share loss in the first quarter a year ago. Sales at the appliance and consumer products company dropped 13 percent to $ 227 million from $ 256.2 million. A group led by the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has offered to buy <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> for $ 812 million. However, <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> has disagreed with the terms of a buyout agreement it reached with <ORGANIZATION> DLJ </ORGANIZATION>, and it has asked a federal bankruptcy judge to void the proposed transaction. Last week the company filed a proposed plan of reorganization, which if approved in bankruptcy court would lead to the sale of the <ORGANIZATION> Sunbeam-Oster </ORGANIZATION> appliance division. The Pittsburgh-based company would retain its businesses in outdoor furniture, electric blankets, clocks, weather instruments and scales.
