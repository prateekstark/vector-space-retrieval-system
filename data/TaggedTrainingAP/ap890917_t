 Outside of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, the country's showcase capital, East Germans live in dreary and decaying cities where nagging shortages and chronic pollution aggravate a rigidly regulated life. `` Everywhere you look outside the city centers, where most foreigners go, the country is disintegrating. It's crumbling before your eyes,'' said <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> student who recently joined an exodus to the West. Although East <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s standard of living is the envy of its Eastern European neighbors, thousands are embarrassing the Communist leadership by fleeing shortly before next month's 40th anniversary celebrations. Many of them come from the provincial cities where life is the toughest, and the harsh crackdown on diseen 100 years this month since a jury sentenced eight <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> clan members to life in prison and ordered a ninth hanged for the slaying of five McCoys, ending the bloodshed in which 10 to 20 people died. But most participants died of old age. The Hatfields' patriarch, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> `` Devil Anse'' <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, got religion and gained community respect before he died in 1921 at the age of 83. His grave at <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> is marked by a towering Italian marble sculpture of him. The leader of the McCoys, <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> `` Old Ran' l'' <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, embittered by the deaths of five of his 16 children, moved to town in <LOCATION> Pikeville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, dying in 1910 at age 85. Buried with them are the real reasons behind the feud in the heart of <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION>. What is known is that the Hatfields, living mainly in what is now <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and the McCoys, in <LOCATION> Pike </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, fought on and off for a dozen years in the region's wooded tangle of valleys and ridges Some say the feud started in 1878 over a pig that belonged to the McCoys and ended up in a Hatfield pen. Others say the dispute stemmed from the Civil War, in which, this version goes, the Hatfields fought for the Confederacy and the McCoys the Union. Others say both families fought for the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. Romantics say the feud stemmed from an illicit affair between <PERSON> Johnse </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roseanna </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, and that she eventually bore him a child out of wedlock. In a 1988 book `` Feud: Hatfields, McCoys and <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Change </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION>, 1860-1900,'' author <PERSON> Altina </PERSON> <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> contends the feud was the result of a clash between the traditional culture based on subsistence farming, represented by the McCoys, and the emergence of capitalism fueled by coal mining, timber cutting and railroad interests in the Hatfields' region. Whatever the cause, open warfare between the families began in 1882 when <PERSON> Devil </PERSON> <PERSON> Anse </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, was stabbed two dozen times and shot during an election day brawl in <LOCATION> Pike </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The Hatfields seized the three McCoys responsible, and when <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> died they were tied to paw paw trees and executed. The feud escalated until New Year's Day 1888, when the Hatfields attacked the <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> home in <LOCATION> Pike </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, burning it to the ground and killing two of Old Ran' l's children. The governors of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> became involved in a jurisdictional dispute over the fighting that wound up before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Now, <PERSON> McAllister </PERSON>'s organization is trying to find a way to commemorate the feud and the 1920 Matewan Massacre, a downtown gunbattle between <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> sympathizers and coal company guards in which at least nine people died. The incident was depicted in the 1987 movie `` Matewan.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, a former Matewan mayor, is among those who had to grow up with the stigma attached to the feud, even though his branch of the family had economic ties to <PERSON> Devil </PERSON> <PERSON> Anse </PERSON> and never took part in the bloodshed. `` Not every McCoy or every <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> participated in the shootouts,'' <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> said. `` We're directly related to the so-called feudists, but we were n't participants in the violent part of it.'' But <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> also is on the <ORGANIZATION> Matewan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors, whose plans call for historic restoration downtown. `` As a member of the family, I probably get a little tired of it. Through the years, ever since I was in high school, it has been brought to my attention,'' he said. `` But as a community, I think it's one of our great hopes for economic survival here.''

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s historic transition to democracy is to survive, the new government must quickly solve some serious economic problems. Yet the dimensions and complexity of the crisis are so staggering that even Solidarity's <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, the first non-Communist prime minister in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc, says `` Society has no concept how difficult it will be to reform this economy.'' How bad is it? Consider: The value of the zloty currency continues to plummet as inflation soars. At the end of June, 4,900 zloties bought a dollar. Last week, it took 10,000. That means a man who receives $ 20 a month from an aunt in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> gets more than a month's average wage, which was 122,000 zlotys in July, up from 55,000 in January. As a result, workers by the score have walked away from their state jobs, forcing shops to close, mail to go undelivered and assembly lines to stall. This year's state budget envisioned a deficit equivalent to $ 989 million at the official exchange rate, but the government raised it to $ 4.9 billion in just seven months, said economics Professor <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaleta </PERSON> in the Express Wieczorny newspaper. To span he gap, the government issues more money. Nearly 45 percent of the budget is being covered by the printing of banknotes, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> report. The list of basics available only with difficulty this week in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> includes flour, cheese, sugar, razor blades, matches, washing powder and sanitary napkins. The government survey of the `` mounting disequilibrium'' in the non-food market listed as `` particularly painful'' shortages of clothing, footwear, furniture, consumer electronics, appliances, refrigerators, kitchenware, radios, sewing machines, bicycles, cars, soap and shampoo. `` I have two children and I literally live in front of this store for three weeks because my refrigerator broke down,'' said a woman who, at 11:30 p.m., was in line outside a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> shop where a shipment of new appliances was expected some day. She and other relatives took turns sleeping in a car. The hopelessly inadequate telephone system has less than 3 million telephones for 38 million people, no direct connections to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and a tendency to cut off whole districts where numbers start with a certain digit. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s $ 39 billion on foreign debt, $ 1,026 for every man, woman and child, is the fourth largest in the world after <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. Thirty percent of the government budget subsidizes goods and services, according to a <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> report. The cost of producing beef and veal is 50 percent subsidized, according to the report. Such subsidies mean a farmer could find it cheaper to buy milk at a store than drink it from his own cows. With the average price for coal covering only 53 percent of production costs, supplies for the approaching winter are down dramatically for lack of government subsidies, the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> warns. Other state industries ca n't pay for their coal. Outmoded, inefficient factories should be closed. But they employ huge work forces, making up much of Solidarity's membership, and the critical housing shortage makes it difficult for displaced workers to move to new jobs. The wait for a minuscule <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> apartment is a decade or more, but this year forecasters expect to complete 30,000 housing units less than planned nationwide. Typical is a 20-year-old high rise apartment house on <LOCATION> Dolna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> which has not had hot water for seven of the past 11 months due to shoddy construction and lack of spare parts. Five older neighboring buildings are not equipped for hot water at all. About 20 percent of university students emigrate, <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION> says. Doctors frequently prescribe medicines not available at pharmacies, relying on patients to secure them in the West. Hospital stays require a supply of gifts to the staff to secure everything from clean sheets to anesthetics. Physicians and nurses are among the most underpaid of Poles, a remnant of the glorification of the laborer, and are allowed private patients only after hours at government clinics. A dual currency system has developed, with the dollar used for most meaningful transactions. Coffee, orange juice, Scotch, televisions and apartments generally are available only for dollars. Most economic indicators are down, according to the most recent government statistics: industrial sales by 5.9 percent, manufacturing sales by 6 percent, June livestock procurement 25 percent below June 1988. Harder to quantify, but widely felt, is a decline in the pride of craft as workers become demoralized. `` The present state of services, transportation, communications and health care ... makes daily life extremely difficult, forces people to break moral standards and accept humiliating treatment,'' wrote <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Chelstowski </PERSON> in Economic Life newspaper. The challenge is partly psychological, <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> says. `` The most difficult task is to make people feel that it can be better, although it can not be better immediately,'' he said. A 21-year-old teacher, learning of <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s election, commented: `` We're so tired, it does n't really matter what happens.'' On Aug. 1, the outgoing government took the first radical step, lifting controls on almost all food prices. Although price increases of several hundred percent followed, economists hope supplies will improve. But a consensus is forming that even more painful and radical reforms are needed. `` The economy is on its knees. The pauperization of society advances almost from day to day so there is no time to look for some miraculous cures,'' said <PERSON> Kaleta </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Storm Threatens California Grapes, Brings Rare Lightning</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A powerful storm pelted parts of northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Saturday, causing power failures and a death by lightning and threatening the nation's most valuable white wine grape harvest. The storm knocked out electricity from <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, 100 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Chico </LOCATION>, about 160 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutkowski </PERSON>. He said 200,000 residents lost power beginning at 5 a.m., mostly because of lightning strikes, which are unusual in this part of the West. Service was restored in most areas after a few hours, <PERSON> Rutkowski </PERSON> said. Lightning struck and killed a man during a softball game in <LOCATION> Cotati </LOCATION>, about 40 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, police said. A train that takes visitors on tours of the famed <LOCATION> Napa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> wine country made its inaugural ride, despite being struck by lightning and suffering a power failure before leaving the station. But growers in the area visited by the wine train said the rain threatened to cause rot or late maturity for pricey chardonnay and sauvignon blanc grapes that are nearly ready for harvest on 21,000 acres in <LOCATION> Napa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION> counties. `` It all depends on what happens in the next three of four days,'' said grower <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckstoffer </PERSON>. `` We've got to get some wind and heat to dry things up. But if we get humidity ... these grapes will rot.'' He said as much as three-quarters of the most expensive white grapes in the country, worth $ 1,800 a ton or more, could be lost. The rains could allow ruinous mold to form on the grapes, or dilute the grape sugar, delaying the maturation process and thereby putting the grapes at greater risk of being reached by the rot, saidJerry <PERSON> Luper </PERSON>, winemaster at <LOCATION> Rutherford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> winery. Enologists say the 1989 white grapes of <LOCATION> Napa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION> counties have a potential to be a great vintage _ if the rain does n't get to them first. The red grapes, tougher and thicker-skinner than the whites, are still on the vines and wo n't be harvested for weeks.

 Miss Missouri <PERSON> Debbye </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, a marimba-playing veterinary student, was crowned Miss America 1990 on Saturday night. Miss Turner grabbed and hugged first runner-up Miss <PERSON> Maryland </PERSON> <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Cha </PERSON>, 25, of <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON>, and gave a thumbs-up sign to the audience before tearfully walking the runway. The other contestants swarmed around her as she finished her walk. `` It's exhilarating. I can only compare it to being in the Olympics,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. The second runner-up was Miss Colorado <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Riecks </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION>; the third runner-up was Miss <PERSON> Illinois </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeri </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; and the fourth runner-up was Miss <PERSON> Ohio </PERSON> <PERSON> Kristin </PERSON> <PERSON> Huffman </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Winchester </LOCATION>. Miss Turner is the third black woman to become Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in the pageant's 68-year history. She succeeds Miss America 1989 <PERSON> Gretchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Anoka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>. Miss <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said she felt no added pressure being a black Miss America `` I'm <PERSON> Debbye </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. I grew up in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. I attend school in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. I'm a born-again Christian,'' she said. `` That's who I am. Being black is not who I am.'' She said she could only attribute her victory to the `` grace of God,'' and now that she has won, her plans include eating pepperoni pizza and sleeping. Miss <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> placed the crown on Miss Turner's head before sending her walking down the runway in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Convention Center as host <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> sang the pageant standard, `` There She Is.'' This year's contest became a platform for social issues for the first time. Each finalist was asked a question about the issue of her choice. Miss Turner was asked how to best motivate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s youth. `` You have to let them know they can do anything and then show them the way to do that,'' she said. The 5-foot-7 -LCB-, 118-pound contestant with dark brown hair and brown eyes won one of the three preliminary swimsuit competitions, in which she wore a canary yellow swimsuit. Miss <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said her studies as a senior at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missouri-Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterinary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shool </ORGANIZATION> have given her the opportunity to treat `` everything from a 4-day-old Vietnamese pot-bellied piglet to a 2,000-pound <ORGANIZATION> Hereford </ORGANIZATION> bull.'' She said she collects `` surgery souvenirs'' such as puppy fetuses. `` I just have a pure love for animals,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, who turns 24 on Tuesday. Miss Turner wowed the crowd by playing the rapid-fire `` Flight of the Bumblebee'' on the marimba. Wearing a two-piece red chiffon pants suit with silver beading and a peplum waistline, she used four mallets for part of the number before tossing two of them behind her in an intense performance. For the evening gown competition, she wore a white velvet beaded gown with a rhinestone bodice. The V-neck gown featured a keyhole back. Each contestant was asked to write an essay before the pageant to detail what she would like to advocate during her year as Miss America. Miss Turner, a poised, self-assured woman, has said she wants to use her reign to motivate young students to strive higher. `` I'm not naive,'' she said before the pageant. `` If I win Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, I'm not saying I'm going to change every youth. If I've inspired one person to be an astronaut, then I'd feel I made a difference. She deflects criticisms that the pageant offers a chance only to white women. `` The doors were n't closed to me,'' she said. `` It's open for any woman who is talented.'' There have been two black Miss Americas. Miss America 1984 <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, however, was dethroned after a men's magazine published nude photos of her cavorting with another woman. The first runner-up that year, <PERSON> Suzette </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, was also black, and she completed Miss <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' reign. Black women were not allowed to enter the pageant for the first three decades of the contest. Blacks portrayed slaves in crowning ceremonies during the early years of the pageant. Miss Turner's father, <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON>, is a retired <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> career officer. Her mother, <PERSON> Gussie </PERSON>, is a counselor, a missionary and an evangelist. She has a 27-year-old sister, <PERSON> Suzette </PERSON>. About 15 friends from Miss Turner's veterinary class at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> attended a party to watch the contest. `` Debbye has the morals, she has the talent and she's a professional,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Patton </PERSON>, a third-year veterinary student. `` It was exciting. It was a thrill just knowing she was there.'' Ten finalists were announced early in the televised program. In addition to the runners-up, the finalists were Miss <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Frick </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Hialeah </LOCATION>; Miss <PERSON> Oklahoma </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamara </PERSON> <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Toshiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Marler </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>; Miss <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Kline </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Easton </LOCATION>; Miss Texas <PERSON> Leah </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Plainview </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, 20, of <LOCATION> Issaquah </LOCATION>. The 10 finalists had the highest scores after three days of preliminary swimsuit, talent and evening gown competitions and interviews with judges. All of this year's contestants were asked by pageant officials to take a stand on the issue of their choice, and the winner will be urged to promote her platform during her reign. Pageant director <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said the idea of giving <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> a voice is one that might bring her more national respect. He has stressed in the past several months that `` this is not just a beauty pageant.'' For the first time, the contestants this year had to submit an essay on the an issue they planned to promote during their year's reign Some of the issues chosen among the 10 finalists included human organ donation, volunteerism, better education for minority students, accessibility for the disabled and discrimination. The festivities were marred Friday night when <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Marler </PERSON> was struck in the head with a beer bottle during the Miss America Parade and suffered a concussion. She spent the night under observation at a city hospital and returned to rehearsal Saturday morning.

 Hurricane Hugo ripped away rooftops and uprooted trees in <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dominica </LOCATION> early Sunday and approached other popular resort islands of the eastern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> with deadly winds of up to 140 mph. Forecasters described <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> as `` extremely dangerous'' and said it could be the most powerful hurricane to hit the region since Hurricane David in 1979. That storm killed an estimated 1,200 people in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` The eye of the hurricane is directly above <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Israel </PERSON> <PERSON> Matos </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> bureau in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, said Sunday at 1:25 a.m. EDT. It was impossible to telephone to <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION> early Sunday morning as telephone circuits were either jammed or busy. At midnight EDT Saturday, <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s center was near 16.3 north latitude and 61.1 <LOCATION> west </LOCATION> <LOCATION> longitude </LOCATION>, about 350 miles east-southeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>. After hitting the French island it was expected to move north toward <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, said forecaster <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> at the National Hurricane Center near <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The hurricane was moving west-northwest at 12 mph, sending showers and gusty winds to the eastern edge of the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and threatening islands over a 600-mile arc stretching from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. The storm's effects would start to be felt in the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> by Sunday morning, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> said. By midnight there was a blackout in most of <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION> as authorities turned off electricity as a precautionary measure, government radio <ORGANIZATION> RFO </ORGANIZATION> said. The island experienced very strong winds, which blew the metal roofing off some homes on <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION>'s eastern side late Saturday night. In <LOCATION> Dominica </LOCATION> to the south there were power outages on the island's north side where strong winds uprooted trees, the radio said <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Internationale </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> shortly before midnight Saturday, said <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> authorities were preparing to send emergency supplies and personnel to <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION>. `` It's a very dangerous storm, extremely dangerous in fact,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. Forecasters said if the storm remains on its northwesterly course it would pass over <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> about 6 p.m. Sunday and continue on to the northeastern coast of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> early Monday. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> capital with a population of 1.1 million, is on the northeastern coast. Earlier, forecasters had said the hurricane was headed for <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>'s southern coast. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> issued hurricane warnings at 3 p.m. EDT for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and for <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, which previously had been on a hurricane watch. The warnings were posted from <LOCATION> Martinique </LOCATION> northward and westward through <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, including the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Martin </LOCATION> and surrounding islands. Tropical storm watches for the islands of <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION> and <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> were discontinued, and a warning for <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucia </LOCATION> was changed to a tropical storm watch. Forecasters said waves 10 feet above normal could be expected near the eye of Hugo, and warned of heavy rain and flooding. In <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dominica </LOCATION>, the first two islands directly in <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s path, civil defense officials prepared to evacuate people to rescue shelters. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, head of the Pan-Caribbean Disaster Preparedness and Prevention Project in <LOCATION> Antigua </LOCATION>, said several relief teams from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> already were headed to the region. State radio said a heavy downpour set off a landslide early Saturday on <LOCATION> Dominica </LOCATION>'s isolated southeast side, which faces the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, partly blocking a road but causing no injuries. The Public Works Department deployed earth-moving equipment at strategic points across the island. Non-critically ill patients at Princess <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Hospital </PERSON> in the capital of <LOCATION> Roseau </LOCATION> were sent home late Friday and early Saturday to make room for possible hurricane victims. The government of <LOCATION> Dominica </LOCATION> urged its citizens via radio to take emergency precautions, and said police were put on alert `` to deal with any security problem which might arise.'' There was widespread looting after Hurricane <PERSON> David </PERSON> battered the tiny island of 81,000 people. In <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION>, which has a population of 340,000, heavy traffic built up in Pointe-a-Pitre, the biggest city, late Friday as people rushed supermarkets and hardware stores, stocking up on food, bottled water and supplies such as flashlights, batteries, timber, nails and tape. The government ordered all pedestrians and cars to be off the streets by 6 p.m. in what amounted to a curfew. The directions were broadcast on radio stations. Residents boarded up doors and windows of their homes and many on the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> side fled inland. At <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Meridien </PERSON>, a luxury, 271-room beachfront hotel in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francois </LOCATION>, a woman who answered the telephone said guests were being moved from ground-floor rooms and those facing the ocean. But she said none of the 100 guests had checked out. `` Many people are worried; nobody's hysterical,'' said the hotel employee, who asked not to be identified by name. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> canceled all three of its flights scheduled Saturday to <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION>'s sister island, <LOCATION> Martinique </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> canceled its flight from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Antigua </LOCATION>, where the airport was closed. Officials in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> said up to 6,000 people might have to be evacuated from flood-prone areas if <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> passes near the densely populated island of 3.3 million. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> is the eighth named storm of the current <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.

 <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> developed chest pains again Sunday, but doctors treating the Nobel laureate said her overall condition was stable. A statement issued by <LOCATION> Woodlands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nursing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Home </LOCATION>, the hospital where she is recovering from a heart attack, said the 79-year-old Roman Catholic nun was `` resting comfortably.'' `` The mother is having some chest pains. But her temperature is showing signs of settling down and her overall condition is stable,'' the statement said. `` We have found one or two causes for the infection. We are hopeful that now she will improve faster,'' said Dr. A.K. <PERSON> Bardhan </PERSON>, refusing to elaborate. <PERSON> Bardhan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> was still using a temporary pacemaker that was attached after she suffered a heart attack Sept. 8. `` But her heart is still weak even though she is improving and responding to treatment,'' he said. <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> first developed chest pains and high fever Thursday just as doctors thought she was progressing well.

<TEXT>
 Two oil tankers collided in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> off eastern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> early Sunday, causing a fire aboard both vessels and an oil slick five miles long, the coast guard said. Seventeen of 26 crew members were evacuated from the Liberian-registered <LOCATION> Phillips </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> after it collided with the Maltese-registered <PERSON> Fiona </PERSON>, anchored near the mouth of the <LOCATION> Humber </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> about 150 miles north of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Clempson </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Fiona </PERSON>'s bosun jumped overboard and was treated for shock after he was rescued, but the rest of the ship's 30-member crew remained aboard, <PERSON> Clempson </PERSON> said. No other injuries were reported. The collision caused about 340,000 gallons of crude oil to escape from the <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, forming a slick about five miles long and a quarter-mile wide before the leak was contained, said <PERSON> Clempson </PERSON>. `` Most of that will have probably been burnt up in the fire,'' he said. `` The way it is heading it does n't appear to be coming ashore.'' <PERSON> Clempson </PERSON> said aircraft were dispatched to spray chemicals to disperse the oil. The fires were extinguished by mid-morning and both ships were anchored off Spurn Head in the mouth of the <LOCATION> Humber </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Clempson </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Phillips </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, laden with 56,000 tons of crude oil, and the <PERSON> Fiona </PERSON> carrying 46,500 tons of refined oil collided at about 5 a.m. -LRB- midnight EDT Saturday -RRB-, he said. `` I'm not going to be drawn on the question of who's responsibility it was,'' he said, adding that the investigation would be conducted by the Marine Accident Investigation branch of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Clempson </PERSON> said it was not clear how the collision occurred, since the <LOCATION> Phillips </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, the moving ship, was damaged on the stern while the <PERSON> Fiona </PERSON> was damaged on the bow. Humberside police said the <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> was inward bound to discharge its cargo. Sea King helicopters, a Nimrod reconnaissance aircraft, a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> minesweeper and firefighting tugs took part in the rescue, <PERSON> Clempson </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON>, who as a child was kidnapped and held captive until he escaped seven years later, died in a motorcycle accident, a coroner's spokesman said. <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON>, 24, was pronounced dead at <ORGANIZATION> Merced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> shortly after the 5:30 p.m. Saturday accident on <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> Fe Highway between <LOCATION> Merced </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, said a <LOCATION> Merced </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> coroner's spokesman, who declined to give his name The car that hit <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON>, who was riding a motorcycle without a helmet, took off after the accident, said state police officer <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxfield </PERSON>. It was found in <LOCATION> Merced </LOCATION> after the driver apparently switched to another car, <PERSON> Maxfield </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON>, the subject of an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> miniseries in May, lived as the son of his abductor, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON>, a convicted child molester. In 1972, at the age of 7, <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON> was kidnapped while walking home from school in <LOCATION> Merced </LOCATION>.

A short time later, <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON> escaped, taking <PERSON> Timmy </PERSON> with him and going to a police station in <LOCATION> Ukiah </LOCATION>, about 150 miles north. <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON> recently talked candidly with reporters of his life with <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON>, who he said alternately molested him and passed him off as his son, calling him <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>. The boy was led to believe his parents did n't want him any more. <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON> was convicted of two counts of kidnapping and was sentenced to eight years and eight months in prison in February 1982 after an 18-day trial in <LOCATION> Hayward </LOCATION>. He served five years at Soledad State Prison, then was on parole for another two years.

 Hurricane Hugo ripped across resort islands of the eastern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> on Sunday with winds up to 140 mph, ripping away rooftops, uprooting trees and leaving an estimated 3,000 people homeless on the island of <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION>. Forecasters described <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> as `` extremely dangerous'' as it churned toward <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and said it could be the most powerful hurricane to hit the region since Hurricane David in 1979. That storm killed an estimated 1,200 people in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. At 9 a.m. EDT, <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s center was located near latitude 16.6 north and longitude 62.7 west, about 250 miles east-southeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> was moving west-northwest at 12 mph and was expected to hit the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> on Sunday night or early Monday, the weather service said. Hurricane warnings were in effect for islands throughout the region. `` All preparedness actions should be rushed to completion in the warned areas,'' the weather service said in its 9 a.m. weather bulletin. The storm slammed into the French island of <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION>, about 350 miles east-southeast of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, just after midnight Sunday. Phone circuits to affected islands were either busy or jammed early Sunday and it could not be immediately determined if the storm caused any casualties on the island of 340,000 people. <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Roure </PERSON>, a government official on <LOCATION> Martinique </LOCATION>, told French radio there were no reports of deaths of serious injuries on <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION> but that it appeared about 3,000 people were left homeless. <LOCATION> Martinique </LOCATION> is about 100 miles south of <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Roure </PERSON> reported heavy damage to buildings and said the airport control tower in the city of Pointe-a-Pitre was `` partially destroyed.'' `` Since people ca n't move around and almost all communications are cut, it is possible there's more information that has not been passed along,'' he said. He said it appeared that <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Desirade </PERSON>, an island of about 1,600 people 22 miles east of <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION>, may have been the hardest hit so far but that all communications with it were cut. The director of civil security at the French <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fournier </PERSON>, said emergency supplies and personnel were being prepared to be sent to <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION> as soon as it was known what was needed. Rainfall of up to 10 inches was expected in the path of the hurricane, producing flash floods and possible mud slides in hilly regions, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. It warned residents in mountainous areas to move to safer locations. Storm surges up to eight feet above normal were expected in coastal areas, forecasters said. In <LOCATION> Dominica </LOCATION> to the south of <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION>, there were power outages on the island's north side where strong winds uprooted trees, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> RFO </ORGANIZATION> radio said. In <LOCATION> Antigua </LOCATION>, just north of <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION>, heavy rain and very strong winds also uprooting trees were reported. Authorities there turned off power to the entire island of 100,000 people as a precautionary measure shortly before midnight. The radio reported flooding in low-lying areas but provided no details. It said dozens of people were moved to shelters. At the plush <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> hotel, on the island's southeastern side, guests were evacuated. In the British dependency of <LOCATION> Montserrat </LOCATION>, northwest of <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION> and directly in <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s path, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Dominique </PERSON>, editor at <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antilles </ORGANIZATION>, said the storm blew down trees and ripped away galvanized rooftops of several homes in the capital, <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION>, early Sunday. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> is the eighth named storm of the current <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.

<TEXT>
 Growing up in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most famous political family did not prepare <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> for the ways of the <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. The political education of Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s younger son began last year, when he challenged a 10-year incumbent in the Democratic primary for a state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat from northwest <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>. It continued when he got to the Statehouse and learned what it really takes to pass a bill. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, 22, was no ordinary freshman. Then a junior and now a senior at <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, he spent $ 87,694, or $ 66 per vote _ a record for a state legislative race _ for a job that pays $ 300 a year. All but $ 5,904 of that was his own money. Then <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> hired a staff aide and opened an office in his district. His predecessor, like most <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> members, had operated alone, using space in his house and his funeral home. But despite his family's wealth and prominence, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> soon found his bills treated the same as everyone else's in a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> where, observers like the group <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cause </ORGANIZATION> say, the speaker's word is law. Several of <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s major initiatives, including a bill to require <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> automobiles to adhere to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> emissions standards, never got out of the committee he sits on, Health, Education and Welfare. `` I talked to most of the members of the committee and it was clear to me that we had a majority to pass that,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` I was told to go speak to the leadership, and I went to speak to -LRB- Majority Leader -RRB- <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON> and he said, ` Well, we have to look into this more,' and it was tabled. `` And I asked around, ` what did this mean?' and people said, ` Well, that's tantamount to letting a bill die quietly.''' The committee's chairman, Democrat <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiorenzano </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s family background should have prepared him for his legislative losses. `` Maybe he's disappointed that things did n't move as fast as he wanted them to, but he should n't have been taken aback,'' <PERSON> Fiorenzano </PERSON> said. `` I've submitted some pieces of legislation every year since I've been elected and they still have n't been passed.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said his father's life in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was nothing like the routine of the <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Statehouse </LOCATION>. `` My father ... has had to come to compromise, he's had to work on things with other colleagues and he's had to agree and disagree,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` That's the way the legislative process is supposed to work, and that can still work without it being -LRB- a system -RRB- where the shots are called without any compromise or agreement.'' The Rev. <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> chapter of Common Cause, a legislative watchdog group, agreed that power is highly centralized in the state house. `` So much seems to happen here by the decision from the speaker's office,'' he said. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said he plans to seek re-election despite his frustration with the system, and already is busy deflecting attacks from Republicans. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> did not run anyone against him last year but since then has criticized <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> repeatedly for raising thousands of dollars from out-of-state sources. ` Where I receive my contributions has no bearing whatsoever on my voting. I thought it was offensive that they implied that people in this neighborhood had their votes for sale,'' he said. `` After a certain point, the amount of money you spend in a local race is ineffective because people have to meet you.'' House leaders said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> has been as effective as any freshman legislator and could have a bright future if he remains in the House. Speaker <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> DeAngelis </PERSON> said he never had asked for <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s vote on any particular bill, but, `` On those issues that were party issues, he has always been a Democrat. <PERSON> Fiorenzano </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s devotion to the job. `` Everyone, when you first get up there, thinks they're going to change the world,'' <PERSON> Fiorenzano </PERSON> said. `` Then you learn not everyone shares your view and you have to work with other people to reach compromises on your issues.''

<HEAD>Reconstruction-era Law Defines Military Role In Drug Battle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The idea of deploying <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s military forces on the nation's streets to battle the scourge of drugs may be fodder for headlines and congressional demands, but <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials point out there are strict legal limitations on such a thing. `` It just makes hair stand on end here,'' said one senior <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official. `` Our primary mission is to prepare for any possible military threat _ not to be a national police force. ... There's been a lot of very loose talk about expanding our role.'' To counter assumptions that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops could be used to patrol the streets and nab drug dealers, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials point to a little-known law that prevents active duty troops from acting as law enforcement officers within the nation's borders. It is known as the Posse Comitatus Act and was passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1878 as a post-Civil War reaction to the use of federal troops in enforcing the Reconstruction Acts. Because it deals with the enforcement of domestic law, the law does not affect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces overseas. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Super </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said that while it may be enticing to think of the nation's military might as a machine to be turned against drug king pins, the ramifications have to be taken into account. `` It's really a rather profound idea when you think about it,'' he said. `` Posse Comitatus is a reflection on our free society. There are a lot of countries where the military is used to police the streets, but they are n't much fun to live in.'' According to a common legal definition, the term `` posse comitatus'' means the power of the county and refers to the authority of the sheriff to call to his aid the male population above the age of 15 to in capturing escaped felons and keeping the peace. In effect, the law is interpreted to mean that military forces _ the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> and their respective reserves _ may be used in a support role for the battle against drugs, such as aiding in surveillance or interdiction efforts. But they are prevented from adopting the role of law enforcement officials, tasks assigned to the local police or other officials, such as from the Drug Enforcement Agency. For example, the military may provide boats to help interdict drug traffickers, or radar surveillance to spot a drug-transporting plane, but it is up to civilian law enforcement officials to seize evidence, make arrests, and testify in court. The law does not affect a state's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> when units are under the control of its governor, but the laws in each state vary, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunlap </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> is the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agency that serves as a coordinating body for the Guard forces in the various states. It is <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> policy that its members `` not be tasked'' with enforcing civil law, officials point out. `` It's important, because we just do n't have the training _ we're not trained to do police work,'' <PERSON> Dunlap </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dunlap </PERSON> said Guard units have been involved in helping local officials support drug interdiction efforts since 1977, and since 1983 has been involved on the federal level. In fact, the role of the Guard has been expanded in 21 states to allow them to aid Customs officials in cargo inspections for illicit drugs, <PERSON> Super </PERSON> said. `` Guardsmen are happy to be involved. ... Guardsmen are all volunteers and part of the community they serve. But our proper role is in support of civilian law enforcement officials,'' <PERSON> Dunlap </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been pressing the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to become more active on the home front in the war against drugs, despite concerns among the military brass about draining resources from their traditional defense mission. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> is slated to outlined an expanded military role this week. The secretary's plan is not expected to call for an enforcement role for the military, but rather emphasize increased interdiction and radar surveillance methods, among other things.

 Iranian President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said Sunday that if <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> does not relinquish Iranian territory it seized in the last days of the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war, his country `` will make it retreat by force.'' It was the toughest statement made by an <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> leader since a cease-fire in the eight-year war took effect Aug. 20, 1988. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, quoted <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> as telling commanders of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Revolutionary Guards: `` We have no territorial ambitions, but we will not cede one inch of our Islamic land. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> did not give <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> a deadline but said, `` We will be patient as far as possible.'' His comments to commanders of the paramilitary Revolutionary Guards were carried by the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in a report monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. `` It will be very easy for us to regain our land,'' said <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, who was elected July 28. He made clear <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will not make any concessions to break a deadlock in peace talks that began more than a year ago. The Iranians insist there can be no advance in the talks until the Iraqis withdraw from Iranian soil. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claims the Iraqis hold 1,028 square miles of Iranian border territory. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers say the Iraqis hold 386 square miles. The land was captured in a series of Iraqi offensives shortly before the cease-fire took effect. Those military setbacks were a key factor in forcing <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to accept the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution. `` <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is not seeking any illogical concession from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, just as it will not make any concessions to the enemy, even if the present situation lasts 10 years,'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said at the Revolutionary Guards' commanders annual conference in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. `` If one day we become certain that the enemy is not willing to return our land, we will make it retreat by force,'' he declared. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has no desire to resume the war, which by Western military estimates killed more than 1 million people. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was believed to have suffered losses three times as heavy as <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. In addition to the land issue, the peace talks are stalled over disagreements concerning the <LOCATION> Shatt-al-Arab </LOCATION> waterway, the southern boundary between the nations. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is demanding that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> allow the waterway _ <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s main outlet to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> _ to be dredged and reopened. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> refuses. In addition, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> does not recognize a 1975 treaty that drew the Iran-Iraq border down the center of the waterway. Before that treaty, the border ran down the Iranian bank of the Shatt-al-Arab. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says the 1975 treaty is valid. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will not back down on the <PERSON> Shatt-al-Arab </PERSON>. `` We will repel the enemy to the borders defined in the 1975 accord,'' he said. Before <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> spoke, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s spiritual leader, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, told commanders their forces and the regular army must be in a state of constant combat readiness. But he noted: `` We are determined to achieve peace within the framework of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution and we will never initiate a step to weaken it.'' The last session of peace talks was held in April under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> auspices.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s violent crackdown on demonstrators for democracy is sharply cutting tourism and private investment and contributing to troubles that will keep the Chinese from matching last year's 11.2 percent economic growth rate, <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> officials say. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the world's most populous country, will `` need to deal with the economic consequences of political problems this -LRB- past -RRB- summer,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Attila </PERSON> <PERSON> Karaosmanoglu </PERSON>. `` These problems include a sharp downturn in tourism and a significant reduction in private investment,'' he told reporters at a briefing on the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s annual report released Sunday. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is enjoying a strong year in agriculture, `` which will reduce the need for food imports,'' but the growth rate can be expected to decline as Chinese leaders pursue measures to cool the economy and reduce inflation, <PERSON> Karaosmanoglu </PERSON> said. He declined to guess how far it would drop under 11.2 percent. For <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, `` the most difficult part of the reform process lies ahead,'' said the annual report. `` The stunning economic results of promoting private enterprise in agriculture and decentralizing decision-making in urban enterprises have brought with them more fundamental problems. ... `` While the rising tempo of economic activity has raised the living standards of the broad mass of population and served to keep alive grassroots support for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s reform program,'' it said, `` such high rates of growth have clearly pushed the economy to the limits of its productive capacity.'' The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> reduced its anticipated fiscal 1989 lending to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> by $ 780 million, to $ 1.3 billion, <PERSON> Karaosmanoglu </PERSON> said, because action by its board on seven projects `` was postponed last June following the events in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>.'' Postponement was ordered in consultation with <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities, he said, adding that `` we hope we can return to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in the near future. ... We fully intend to keep the door open.'' But he said there is no timetable for reviving the postponed projects. World Bank programs in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> include development efforts in remote, deprived areas where, the report noted, `` an estimated 70 million people live in conditions of absolute poverty.''

<TEXT>
 Songs written 6,000 years ago and deciphered from stone tablets will waft through this fabled city on Friday as <PERSON> Babylon </PERSON> relives the ancient days when it was the center of civilization. Tens of thousands of people are expected at the huge cultural extravaganza planned in Babylon, which is about 55 miles south of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. The city was rebuilt by President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> at a cost of about $ 100 million in an ambitious program to revive the splendors of the past and to build a tourist industry folowing the eight-year <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war. For two weeks, <PERSON> Babylon </PERSON>'s reconstructed palaces and temples will echo with music, opera, dance and drama performed by troupes from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and 35 other countries. The focuses of the festival will be the 2,500-seat Greek amphitheater, built in the 4th Century B.C. by <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> the </PERSON> <PERSON> Great </PERSON>, who died in <LOCATION> Babylon </LOCATION>; and the crown hall in the Palace of <LOCATION> Nebuchadnezzar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> II </LOCATION>, who ruled in the 6th century B.C. `` Babylon was the center of the world's civilization, arts and culture and it is right that it regain that fame again,'' said <PERSON> Munir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bashir </PERSON>, chief director of the festival. The first festival was held here in 1987, when <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> were at war. Last year's festival was held just a month after the hostilities ceased under a U.N.-brokered truce. An estimated 100,000 people flocked to <PERSON> Babylon </PERSON> for last year's festival, which featured artists from 24 countries, including Brazilian guitarist <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Liva </PERSON> <PERSON> Sao </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, the American <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jazz </PERSON> <PERSON> Quartet </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION> and the Glamos Folk Group from <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> Only a handful of Europeans and Americans attended. But the Iraqis expect more this year. `` Now that the war's over, we expect many more people,'' <PERSON> Bashir </PERSON> said. A highlight, he said, will be an Iraqi troupe's presentation of songs, dance and music based on ancient Babylonian music. The ancient music was played primarily on harps, some of which have been found in the ruins of the city on the banks of the <LOCATION> Euphrates </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bashir </PERSON> and other Iraqi researchers spent months unraveling the notations on stone tablets to reproduce the primitive tunes, which will be performed in public for the first time in millenia. <PERSON> Bashir </PERSON>, 59, is director of music at the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Culture </ORGANIZATION> and is the world's most renowned virtuoso of the oud, an Arabic stringed instrument that was the forebear of the lute. The Iraqis claim that the ancient land known as <LOCATION> Mesopotamia </LOCATION>, or `` land between the rivers'' _ the <LOCATION> Euphrates </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tigris </LOCATION> _ was the `` cradle of civilization.'' It is also the reputed site of the Garden of Eden. The Babylonians ruled an empire that flourished as a cultural, religious and commercial center for hundreds of years. The legal and social codes they developed were the first to provide for individual and family rights and have influenced modern legal systems.

 Now that the doors of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have opened after 20 years of American knocking, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is faced with the dilemma of handling an unprecedented surge of Soviet emigres. Critics charge the administration's response, as presented this week on Capitol Hill after seven months of deliberations, is inadequate, unimaginative and risks missing a historic opportunity. Some say the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government could learn a thing or two from Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s open door policy. The administration argues it is doing its best in the face of shrinking budgets and the problem of dealing with 14 million refugees worldwide, many of whom would like to move to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Of the 125,000 refugee slots allocated for fiscal 1990 _ that starts Oct. 1 _ 50,000 will be reserved for Soviet applicants, most of whom are Jews. The administration predicts as many as 150,000 Soviet Jews will apply for refugee status in fiscal 1990. Jewish groups say as many as 500,000 Jews may seek to come here in the coming years if the doors remain open, especially in light of rising anti-Semitism in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. An internal <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report used by <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> officers in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> concluded that glasnost, with its liberalized rights to free speech and press, has spawned discrimination against Jews throughout the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Religious groups and many on Capitol Hill also argue that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms and his political future are by no means assured success, and their failure could strand thousands of persecuted people wishing to leave. `` Soviet history has painfully demonstrated that lulls in government repression are usually followed by harsh oppression,'' said a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from World Relief, which represents Evangelical Christians. The Evangelicals constitute a small percentage of those seeking to come here. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> say if tight budgets are the problem keeping more Soviets from coming to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, `` creative financing'' should be considered. Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, suggested the government help additional refugees by lending them money for their relocation, which would be paid back once they're settled. `` When the faucets start opening ... the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> finds itself totally incapable of dealing with the very policy it is demanding,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>. The administration agreed. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is to some degree a victim of its own success,'' said Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>. But he argued that although the demand for liberalized Soviet emigration was a cornerstone of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy for nearly 20 years, `` never was it said that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has an obligation to take them all in.'' He urged other countries, like Western European states, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, to share the burden. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> may be the only clear beneficiary of the surge of emigration, which could go a long way to beefing up the Jewish population and countering a growing Arab population domestically and in neighboring states. Israeli officials said privately this week that once Soviet Jews realize their entry to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was sharply restricted, they might choose <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Most Jews and Evangelicals who have left so far have done so on an Israeli visa. Once they get to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, however, all but 10 percent or so shift direction for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. This has created a backlog in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> expected to reach 30,000 by Oct. 1. Some have been waiting for 18 months. Responding to growing pressure from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the administration promised this week its first priority would be to clear up the backlog in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, in an effort to head off pending legislation that would automatically grant refugee status to all Soviet applicants, announced he had ordered a review of 5,000 cases of Soviets in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> who have been denied refugee status. Once the backlog is cleared, the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> centers, which have cost the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> $ 34 million annually to maintain, will be shut. All processing will be handled in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, with a new <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> facility to help. The administration is negotiating with the Soviets to be allowed to increase its INS embassy staff from three to six officers starting Oct. 1. Lawmakers this week ridiculed this solution, saying six adjudicators would barely make a dent in the wave of applications but noting that because the 1990 quota has already been used up by the backlogs in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, this would not matter much, anyway.

 The nation's new high-tech weather radar system has passed its first test and is now headed for a detailed evaluation, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> announced Sunday. On a scale of 1-100, the new radar scored a 91 at detecting severe storms in five months of tests at the Air Force Operational Test and <ORGANIZATION> Evaluation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Norman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>. By comparison, the nation's current weather radar system averaged only a 58 on the same types of tests, the <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reports <ORGANIZATION> NWS </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Elbert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Friday </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said he was pleased with the results in the tests of NEXRAD, or Next Generation Weather Radar. However, he said more performance and reliability testing must be done before the system can be installed across the country. NEXRAD will begin operational testing in the spring, with the first system expected to become operational in July at <LOCATION> Twin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, according to Friday. By the mid-1990s the new system is expected to go into service at 165 locations across the nation. The system will be used by the <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. In addition to improving the ability to forecast tornadoes, thunderstorms, hailstorms and damaging winds the new radars also had less than half as many false alarms as the current radar system. The new radars use what is called Doppler technology, which allows the radar beam to detect not just the presence of rain and moisture in the air, but also the speed and direction of winds. Radar sends out an electronic impulse, and when part of that impulse bounces back the machine can determine the location of the object causing the reflection. In the case of Doppler radar it can also determine the movement of the reflecting item, such as a tornado or thunderstorm. In the tests the new radars were able to detect severe weather as far as 250 miles from the site of the equipment, officials said.

<HEAD>Resort Area Slowly Sinks; Contractor Accepts Blame</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A six-block area of <LOCATION> Waikiki </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> is sinking _ splitting sidewalks, tilting small buildings and making streets uneven _ but a building contractor has taken responsibility. In order to excavate a block-sized area in the heart of the tourist mecca to a depth of 30 feet as part of a $ 50 million commercial project, <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has been pumping up to 7,000 gallons of groundwater out of the hole every minute since May. Officials of <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> accepted responsibility and have had crews scrambling around to fill and patch the newest pavement cracks or gaps between sidewalks or sagging walls and buildings as soon as they are reported. Engineers and consultants who planned the project and city officials who approved the plans assumed there would be some soil settlement, said the city's chief building inspector, <PERSON> Sadao </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaneshiro </PERSON>. The water table in the area is just 6 feet below the surface. `` Whenever you take out groundwater, the surrounding areas will be affected,'' <PERSON> Kaneshiro </PERSON> said. `` They knew that, but it's a matter of degree. They did n't know how much.'' In some places, the subsidence has been as much as 4 inches. Pumping _ and, officials hope, the sinking _ will stop when construction reaches the fourth-floor level in about six weeks, said <PERSON> Trudie </PERSON> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION>'s marketing manager. Managers of neighboring buildings are pleased with <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION>'s response, but do n't like the nuisance and think the contractors and city should have anticipated the problem. `` After all, <LOCATION> Waikiki </LOCATION> is built on a swamp, and these guys are draining the swamp,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Apell </PERSON>, building manager of the nearby Royal Kuhio condominium. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Winter </PERSON>, general manager of the <LOCATION> Waikiki </LOCATION> Joy Hotel, across the street from the hole, said he is trying to take the problem in stride and `` ca n't give enough credit to <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> for trying to repair the damage.'' <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Line </PERSON>, administrator of the 13-story <ORGANIZATION> Laniolu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retirement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> and Care Center, said `` it's not just the actual damage, it's the mental anguish the residents go through They ask me, ` Are we still safe? Is the building going to fall down?''' <PERSON> Willella </PERSON> <PERSON> Reub </PERSON>, a resident of <LOCATION> Laniolu </LOCATION>, said it's a question of comfort. Her wheelchair `` rides hard'' over the bumps caused by the subsidence, she said.

<HEAD>Hungarian Ambassador Denies Kremlin Approved Opening Borders</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Hungarian ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Sunday denied Western speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> had given prior approval to his government's decision to open its borders to East Germans fleeing to the West. Ambassador <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Varkonyi </PERSON> told a television interviewer that `` I have n't got strict information on'' the decision, but that `` Hungarian decisions are made in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>,'' the Hungarian capital. `` Of course, there is a diplomatic way of consultation and information, but the decision was taken in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Varkonyi </PERSON> said on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> program, `` This Week with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>.'' Asked whether the decision had been made `` without reference to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' the ambassador replied, `` Without any reference to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> at all.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, in an article from <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, published in its Sunday editions, quoted unidentified Western officials saying that <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> consulted with the Kremlin before allowing the East Germans to leave. And a former senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government official said she believed the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> had approved the Hungarian decision in advance. <PERSON> Rozanne </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON>, a former ambassador to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs, asked whether she thought <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> had given <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> the green light, said: `` I do think that is true.'' The Hungarian ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said that although the flight of an estimated 14,000 East Germans across Hungarian borders to the West had drawn criticism from the East German leadership, his government did not plan to close the frontier. `` To send them back against their will and without any provisions that they would be immune to any punishment, and would have a legal opportunity to emigrate, would have been not correct and we would like to comply with our international obligations on human rights,'' he said. Multilateral agreements signed by Western and Soviet bloc nations `` explicitly say certain things about choice of emigration,'' and nations that do sign but do not heed those pacts are in violation, he said. `` If they are not ensuring a choice of emigration, it seems to be that it is n't complying with the international agreements we have signed,'' <PERSON> Varkonyi </PERSON> said. Two other guests on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> program, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> ambassador <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhfus </PERSON> and <PERSON> Theo </PERSON> <PERSON> Summer </PERSON>, editor of the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hamburg </ORGANIZATION>, predicted the East German government would be forced to drop its resistance to the types of political and economic reform underway in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>China Steps Up Rhetoric Against Foreign Journalists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> stepped up its campaign against the Western press Sunday, reprinting a 65-year-old commentary calling for the expulsion of all foreign reporters. Also Sunday, Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> told a <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> delegation that the government will not soon lift martial law in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> because citizens seized many weapons from the army during the June crackdown on pro-democracy protesters. The official <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Daily reprinted on its front page a 1924 essay by <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Dazhao </PERSON>, co-founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, saying <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was the victim of `` journalistic invasion.'' The article applauded the expulsion of a British reporter who erroneously reported the death of <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Yat-sen </PERSON>, the man regarded as the father of modern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Sun died in 1925. But <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Dazhao </PERSON> said expelling one reporter was not enough. `` The Chinese government ... should expel all foreign reporters, who spread rumors, make trouble and insult <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' he said. The article was accompanied by another commentary saying the article shows that foreign journalists have been spreading rumors in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for decades. `` The ` press freedoms' of imperialist countries have n't progressed at all,'' it said It said <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Dazhao </PERSON>'s writings were reprinted to show that the `` rumor-mongering'' of <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, the American government-funded radio station, was not `` an accidental mistake.'' Voice of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, regarded by its large Chinse audience as one of the few independent sources of information available, has been repeatedly attacked by the government for its reporting on the democracy movement. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> ordered seven reporters, including two from <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>, to leave during the crisis in June which led to troops firing on demonstrators, killing hundreds and perhaps thousands. A third commentary in Sunday's Economic Information criticized leaders of the democracy movement for calling for freedom of the press, saying they have an idealized view of Western freedoms. Official newspapers in May gave colorful, accurate coverage of the pro-democracy protests, exhibiting a degree of journalistic independence never before seen in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. But in the current crackdown on dissent they have reverted to conveying the party line. Sunday's commentary claimed that press freedoms do not exist in Western countries and that the American media are controlled by 50 powerful companies that `` not only hold the media organizations' economic lifeblood but also directly intervene in -LRB- their -RRB- reporting and editing policies. It singled out political scientist <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiaqi </PERSON> for `` beautifying the press freedoms of Western countries'' and <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> for `` showing unusual interest in political questions.'' <PERSON> Yan </PERSON>, an adviser to ousted party chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, fled to the West shortly after the June military attack. The <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> was temporarily shut down and its editor, <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> <PERSON> Benli </PERSON>, was fired for supporting the student-led movement. `` In socialist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> ... to be a journalist of the party -LRB- means -RRB- to be of one mind with the party,'' the article said. The commentaries Sunday follow a series of essays in recent weeks on the role of journalism in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Japanese sources said Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> told former Foreign Minister <PERSON> Masayoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, who is heading a five-member parliamentary delegation to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, that martial law must continue because hundreds of weapons seized by citizens during the June 3-4 clash with the military have yet to be retrieved. The premier, in his meeting with Japanese leaders, said life in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> had returned to normal, but anti-government forces still exist and the military was needed to assist police in maintaining order, the Japanese sources reported. The sources said <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> urged <PERSON> Li </PERSON> to lift martial law soon. He also said that although <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> did not want to interfere in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s internal affairs, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> should realize that the military suppression of the protesters had hurt <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s international image

 Republicans may propose a new strategy Monday to pay for the war on drugs as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> continues its debate on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan to fight narcotics trafficking, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said Sunday. With two weeks before the start of a new fiscal year, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is scrambling to pass a dozen money bills needed to keep the government running, but is stymied over how to wage and finance the war on drugs. The money measures are stacked up in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> like planes over a busy airport as negotiators try to work out the politically charged drug issue, with both Democrats and Republicans angling to show they care more than the other side about the narcotics scourge. `` We have fundamentally different objectives and goals,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> He said Democrats will be content only if the growth in the number of cocaine addicts is reversed, drug treatment is provided for all who want it and drug education is extended to nearly every school child in the country. There are `` glaring deficiencies'' in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan, particularly in those areas, <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said. And signaling his party's intention to make drugs a political battleground, he promised `` a much broader Democratic strategy'' to be elucidated in the weeks and months ahead. Republicans claimed the issue as their top priority as well and said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had fulfilled his mandate by proposing an ambitious and comprehensive anti-drug package. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press'' that `` I do n't think we find any problem in the president's package.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself said he remains flexible about how to pay for the initiative, but added: `` I strongly believe that we must retain the integrated elements of this drug strategy, which took more than six months to develop.'' The president proposed increasing spending by $ 1.5 billion over what he had asked in his initial fiscal 1990 budget request, with the heaviest emphasis on law enforcement and prosecution. He sought to pay for the program by reducing spending on other domestic programs. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, then upped the ante by proposing an additional $ 2.2 billion in spending, to be paid for with an across-the-board spending cut of about half a <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>'s emphasis was on treatment and education. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators for the two sides _ nine Democrats and nine Republicans _ were to meet again late Monday to see whether agreement could be reached on a drug-fighting plan and a way to pay for it. But until such a package could be worked out, the spending bills that will include any payment scheme were effectively frozen in place. `` It'll be a critical meeting,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` We may make a counter offer at that time _ Republican.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> rejected <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>'s proposal and said `` we ought to look at more than across-the-board cuts. We ought to look at ... other ways to find the money.'' As the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> wrangled over drugs, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leadership was seeking to formulate an alternative to the capital gains tax cut approved last week by the <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The tax-writing panel handed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a major victory on the issue, but Democrats want to head it off on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor by offering an alternative tax package that would be more philosophically in tune with their theme of fighting for the middle class _ possibly including a new tax break for individual retirement accounts. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor agenda for the week included consideration of a $ 270 million bill to provide for increased security and weapons detection systems at airports, and legislation that would regulate shipping to prevent catastrophic accidents such as the Alaskan oil spill and make those involved in oil transportation pay the full costs of cleanup.

<HEAD>De Klerk Wins Praise, But The Honeymoon Likely to be Brief</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President-elect F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> has won praise for allowing huge anti-apartheid marches, but political analysts said Sunday the honeymoon will be brief unless he quickly brings reforms. In a major policy shift, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said Tuesday that police will not disrupt peaceful demonstrations, previously banned or forcefully dispersed. A day later, 20,000 activists in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> staged the country's largest legal demonstration, followed by similar protests Friday in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> `` Nice going, F.W. _ but what's next?'' the Sunday Star of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> asked in an editorial. `` A few protest marches do not alter the fundamental -LRB- apartheid -RRB- system which governs our lives.. The window of opportunity -LRB- for reform -RRB- is open but it will not remain so for long.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, to be sworn into office Wednesday, says he wants to give the 28-million voteless black majority a limited role within five years in the national government, now dominated by leaders of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 5 million whites. On Saturday, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> named <PERSON> Gerrit </PERSON> <PERSON> Viljoen </PERSON>, the former minister of black education, to spearhead government efforts to negotiate a new constitution with blacks. <PERSON> Viljoen </PERSON>, who has a doctorate in literature, is a bookish, soft-spoken, political moderate closely allied with <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>. Black leaders are skeptical of <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s promises, and bringing them to the negotiating table will not be easy. They refuse to have talks with the government, saying it first must end the 3-year-old state of emergency, release political prisoners such as <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and legalize the guerrilla-backed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and other banned organizations. Activists say they will analyze <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s offer at a major Oct. 7 conference in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> on strategy to end <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s apartheid system of legal race discrimination `` We will have an opportunity ... to look at Mr. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s promises and his ability to fulfill them,'' anti-apartheid leader the Rev <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON> said Saturday. Meanwhile, activists will pursue a 6-week-old nationwide campaign of defiance that has targeted segregated schools, hospitals, beaches, buses and other facilities. A march through downtown <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> is scheduled Friday, and additional beach protests are set for the end of September. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s calls for reform remain vague and likely will draw fire from activists and conservatives when he begins to spell out changes. `` He has done little more than commit himself to the political equivalents of apple pie and mother's love _ negotiated solutions and a peaceful, prosperous society,'' wrote <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Venter </PERSON>, political columnist for the <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest paper. `` The content of the man's political vision ... is not yet clear.'' The extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which opposes all concessions to blacks, has harshly attacked de Klerk for authorizing the demonstrations. `` A knife has been thrust in the back of the upholders of law and order,'' said Conservative spokesman <PERSON> Moolman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mentz </PERSON>. Several local newspapers reported de Klerk approved the protests despite opposition from security officials, who seldom were overruled by <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s retiring predecessor, P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> calls for an end to discrimination, but insists he will preserve segregated schools and neighborhoods for whites who want them. He also has made clear he will not accept a one-man, one-vote political system, or black majority rule.

<HEAD>Fight to Save ``Top Gun'' Tomcat Hinges on Fate of New Fighter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision earlier this year to cancel the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s F-14D jet fighter that achieved fame in the movie `` Top Gun'' touched off a major campaign in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to save the carrier aircraft. The lobbying paid off last month when the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved a bill that restored $ 1 billion for 24 planes over the next two years. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, in its defense bill, had endorsed the president's plan to kill the Tomcat fighter As members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> get down to fashioning a final version of the defense bill during the coming week, congressional backers of the F-14D are taking heart in the woes of another aircraft _ the Advanced Tactical Fighter. The two prototypes of the plane _ one for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and one for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> _ will not share a common design, forcing the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to pay for two separate fighter plane programs, according to recent reports. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said at a hearing earlier this month that development of the next-generation aircraft, which is intended to succeed the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s F-15 and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s F-14D, has slipped six months The problems prompted the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, in its appropriations bill, to eliminate the $ 1.1 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s fighter and $ 65 million for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s version in the fiscal 1990 budget. `` The -LRB- House Appropriations -RRB- committee is not convinced ... that the <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> program as currently structured will meet the requirement with a mission and cost effective solution,'' the panel said in its report accompanying the spending bill. Specifically, the committee complained that the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> predicts the <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> will be built at a rate of 72 per year, yet it has been unable `` to achieve such a sustained rate for the F-15 which by any measure is a much cheaper aircraft.'' The panel also noted that in the last six months, the cost of research and development of the program has increased by $ 900 million, to $ 13.5 billion. With the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> planning to buy 750 advanced tactical fighters at a total cost of about $ 64 billion and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> planning to replace the F-14D with the <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION>, the price could exceed the $ 70 billion for the B-2 stealth bomber program. That bat-winged aircraft is considered the most expensive in history. Lawmakers indicated last week that although the problems of the advanced tactical fighter have raised concerns on Capitol Hill, and may help the F-14D campaign, the <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conferees likely will restore much of the money for the radar-evading fighter. The action by the House was the proverbial shot across the bow, members said. `` It was a strong message to the administration and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON>, D-Wash., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee on defense Two groups are building prototypes of the plane. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> are building the design known as YF-23 while <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> are constructing YF-22. The prototypes are scheduled to fly next year with the contract to be awarded in January 1991. Ideally, the <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> will replace the F-14D, manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, without a void in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s line of carrier fighters. `` We hope to sequence in the <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> and not have a gap,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDade </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the Appropriations defense subcommittee.

 <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> this week kicks off a new phase of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's war on drugs after an intense behind-the-scenes struggle by state politicians seeking more federal money and a share of the spotlight. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> lawmakers want the extra federal money that would come with designation of the city as a `` high-intensity drug trafficking area,'' but they also worry about the effect such a declaration would have on the city's image. At the same time, the state's two Republican senators are offering different advice to <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>: <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> wants more emphasis on crime prevention while <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> puts the focus on punishment of offenders. To qualify for the extra money under the 1988 federal drug law, an area must be a major drug distribution center that already has committed itself to solving the problem. `` It's difficult for the city, which I think is making heroic efforts to get not only drug abuse, but drug dealing, under control,'' <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> said. `` At the same time, we have to demonstrate to <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> not only that the city is making a good effort, but that the problems are growing and that they are potentially worse in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> than in many other <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cities.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION>, plans to visit <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> on Monday, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area Tuesday and <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> on Wednesday. Details of his schedule were not immediately released for security reasons. The announcement of the trip set off immediate jockeying by <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> officials to define <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s itinerary. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> is making the trip to promote the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's $ 7.9 billion plan calling for a crackdown on all levels of drug trafficking <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> lobbyists and city officials expressed concern that efforts to dramatize the need for federal might create the impression that the city has failed. But <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> said, `` I do not think it is any big secret that <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> has a major drug problem just like <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and other cities. I think people would be surprised if their elected officials did not do everything possible to prevent it.'' <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> agreed on the seriousness of the problem. `` Reported drug crimes rose 74 percent in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> in 1988, while the city's murder rate exceeded one per day for the first time in eight years,'' he said in a letter to <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> requesting the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> visit.

 Five political veterans are leading eight others in the primary race for mayor of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, often touted as one of the nation's most liveable cities but facing problems with crime, desegregation and traffic. The large field without any clear front-runner contributed to a largely ho-hum race for Tuesday's primary, said Deputy Mayor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>, an 18-year City Hall veteran. The top two finishers in the primary for the non-partisan office meet in a runoff Nov. 7. There are no statewide candidates on the ballot this year, but an unusual number of cities across <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state are selecting successors to outgoing mayors. Mayor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Royer </PERSON> is leaving after an unprecedented three four-year terms to become director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politics </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Although there is no overwhelming favorite, City Councilman <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, who is seeking to become <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>'s first black mayor, is generally seen as the likely top vote-getter. <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Revelle </PERSON>, a former city councilman and county executive, and <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Jewett </PERSON>, the city attorney, are considered best bets for the No. 2 runoff spot. Also given a shot are council members <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Sibonga </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Street </PERSON>. Judging partly by voter turnout in 1985, when <PERSON> Royer </PERSON> defeated <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> by a more than 5-to-3 margin, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> and Elections Division has predicted about 28 percent of the city's approximately 300,000 registered voters will cast ballots In recent years <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> consistently has been picked as one of the country's best places to live, do business and raise children. Its maritime environment, mountain views and booming economy rank high in magazine surveys. `` I do n't want to sound too self-serving, but it's kind of hard to beat up on the government,'' said <PERSON> Royer </PERSON>, the incumbent. `` We've done a good job The city is in terrific financial shape.'' However, at the same time burglary rates are skyrocketing, there is debate over school desegregation, and traffic congestion rivals that of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The leading mayoral candidates differ less on these issues than on terms of experience, leadership and style. `` I think it is very difficult to define any big differences in terms of the issues,'' said <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>. `` There is a strong overlap among all of us in terms of a progressive, liberal approach to social services, housing and these sorts of issues,'' said Street. <PERSON> Jewett </PERSON> is the only major candidate who supports an initiative to end mandatory busing for school desegregation, partly by diverting some $ 4 million a year in city tax revenues to finance projects designed to attract a racial balance by voluntary school registration. Also on the ballot are <ORGANIZATION> Mountaineers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Carsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Lien </PERSON> and advertising man <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, credited with creating the smiling yellow `` happy face.'' The face figured in a 1967 ad campaign for a local bank, and <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>'s using it now in his own campaign. For whose who call the vacantly smiling circle superficial, <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> counters: `` The Happy Face is not frivolous. It's a symbol of my optimism, and that's important. We need optimism. I'm very optimistic about this city.'' Candidates with almost no visible campaign organizations are <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandy </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> photographer; <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hegamin </PERSON>, a retired City Light engineer; <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Ballard </LOCATION> business operator; <PERSON> Robbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherr </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> activist; <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Paulson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> veteran; and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Willmott </PERSON>, founder of the free food and shelter group Strand Helpers.

<DATELINE>MATEWAN, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Hatfields and McCoys do n't fight anymore and many of them would just as soon forget their ancestors' feud But some in the community are trying to find a way to commemorate the bloodshed. `` There are a lot of grandsons of Devil Anse -LRB- <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> -RRB- and his brothers around here,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McAllister </PERSON>, director of the new <ORGANIZATION> Matewan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` Most of them are in their 60s and they're a little bit bitter about the reputations they had to grow up with and live with.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Matewan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, located in the only three-story building in the town of 800, features a photo display on the massacre and other incidents in the town's history. It draws a few people a week. <PERSON> McAllister </PERSON> is hoping the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> will help turn Matewan into a tourist attraction. He envisions a museum, for instance, within 10 years. It's been 100 years this month since a jury sentenced eight <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> clan members to life in prison and ordered a ninth hanged for the slaying of five McCoys, ending the bloodshed in which 10 to 20 people died. But most participants died of old age. The Hatfields' patriarch, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> `` Devil Anse'' <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, got religion and gained community respect before he died in 1921 at the age of 83. His grave at <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> is marked by a towering Italian marble sculpture of him. The leader of the McCoys, <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> `` Old Ran' l'' <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, embittered by the deaths of five of his 16 children, moved to town in <LOCATION> Pikeville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, dying in 1910 at age 85. Buried with them are the real reasons behind the feud in the heart of <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION>. What is known is that the Hatfields, living mainly in what is now <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and the McCoys, in <LOCATION> Pike </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, fought on and off for a dozen years in the region's wooded tangle of valleys and ridges Some say the feud started in 1878 over a pig that belonged to the McCoys and ended up in a Hatfield pen. Others say the dispute stemmed from the Civil War, in which, this version goes, the Hatfields fought for the Confederacy and the McCoys the Union. Others say both families fought for the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. Romantics say the feud stemmed from an illicit affair between <PERSON> Johnse </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roseanna </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, and that she eventually bore him a child out of wedlock. In a 1988 book `` Feud: Hatfields, McCoys and <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Change </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION>, 1860-1900,'' author <PERSON> Altina </PERSON> <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> contends the feud was the result of a clash between the traditional culture based on subsistence farming, represented by the McCoys, and the emergence of capitalism fueled by coal mining, timber cutting and railroad interests in the Hatfields' region. Whatever the cause, open warfare between the families began in 1882 when <PERSON> Devil </PERSON> <PERSON> Anse </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, was stabbed two dozen times and shot during an election day brawl in <LOCATION> Pike </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The Hatfields seized the three McCoys responsible, and when <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> died they were tied to paw paw trees and executed. The feud escalated until New Year's Day 1888, when the Hatfields attacked the <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> home in <LOCATION> Pike </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, burning it to the ground and killing two of Old Ran' l's children. The governors of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> became involved in a jurisdictional dispute over the fighting that wound up before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Now, <PERSON> McAllister </PERSON>'s organization is trying to find a way to commemorate the feud and the 1920 Matewan Massacre, a downtown gunbattle between <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> sympathizers and coal company guards in which at least nine people died. The incident was depicted in the 1987 movie `` Matewan.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, a former Matewan mayor, is among those who had to grow up with the stigma attached to the feud, even though his branch of the family had economic ties to <PERSON> Devil </PERSON> <PERSON> Anse </PERSON> and never took part in the bloodshed. `` Not every McCoy or every <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> participated in the shootouts,'' <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> said. `` We're directly related to the so-called feudists, but we were n't participants in the violent part of it.'' But <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> also is on the <ORGANIZATION> Matewan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors, whose plans call for historic restoration downtown. `` As a member of the family, I probably get a little tired of it. Through the years, ever since I was in high school, it has been brought to my attention,'' he said. `` But as a community, I think it's one of our great hopes for economic survival here.''

<HEAD>World Bank Finds 1988 Good for Rich Countries, Mixed in Third World</HEAD>

 Richer countries like the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had a good year in 1988 and so did some in the Third World like <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday, but incomes in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> continued to fall. The bank said 21 industrial countries, from <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, increased their production by a combined 4.2 percent. Since their populations increase slowly, the average income of each citizen went up almost as much. Some countries in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> had much bigger increases in output, but populations grow faster there, holding down per capita growth. The bank is owned by 151 governments, with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> holding the largest block of shares. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> representatives gather here this week for the annual meeting of the bank and its sister organization, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> will represent the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to speak. A major topic will be progress made with <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s new attempt to cut the burden of Third World countries' $ 1.3 trillion debt and the $ 131 billion they had to pay on it last year. He wants banks to forgive some debt or lower interest rates instead of just lending new money. The first deals have been worked out for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Critics call them too small to let the debtor countries keep the money they need to create jobs, raise their low incomes and buy goods from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and others. `` The central goal of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> is the reduction of poverty,'' the annual report said. `` Ways to achieve that are at the heart of the bank's activities.'' It concentrated heavily on loans to countries in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Except for the Republic of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which does not borrow from the bank, that is one of the world's poorest areas. The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> gets most of its funds from profits generated on loans _ just over $ 1.09 billion in the past year. Since no dividends are paid, all the profits are plowed back into the bank's lending. Officials point out that the bank's object is to raise living standards in the borrowing countries, not to make money. Its annual economic survey concentrated on low-income countries and found that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> were the fastest growing in that category _ <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> with 11.2 percent growth and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> with 8 percent. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> remained the biggest borrower from the bank, as it has been in recent years, taking about $ 3 billion. Despite its record of growth, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> remains one of the poorest countries. The bank estimated the income of the average Indian both at $ 300 dollars in 1987, the most recent figure available. The Chinese average was $ 290. `` The newly industrialized economies of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> continued their strong growth, also over 8 percent as a group,'' the bank said. The newly industrialized group includes such countries as <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> with a $ 2,690 average income in 1987 and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> with a $ 7,940 average. `` It is also notable that a number of ` second-tier' newly industrializing countries _ <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> in particular _ are moving into higher performance categories,'' the report said. Production grew by only 1.4 percent in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. That was slower than the growth of population, so average incomes were down again. In southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, production growth reached 3 percent, but the high birth rate resulted in a another drop of average incomes.

 <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> developed mild chest pains again Sunday, but doctors treating the Nobel laureate said her overall condition remained stable. Doctors also said the 79-year-old Roman Catholic nun has contracted a malaria parasite, but insisted it is not the cause of a recurring fever. A statement Sunday evening from <LOCATION> Woodlands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nursing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Home </LOCATION>, the hospital where <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> is recovering from a heart attack, said her condition did not change during the day. `` The mother has had mild chest pains but her temperature is showing signs of settling,'' the statement said. `` She slept well in the afternoon after having a light meal.'' A nun at the <ORGANIZATION> Missionaries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charity </ORGANIZATION>, the Calcutta-based order established nearly 40 years ago, said <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> was `` very, very weak.'' `` It's difficult to say how serious -LRB- her condition -RRB- is. One day she seems fine and getting better and the next day she's not,'' the nun said on condition of anonoymity. Doctors had hoped <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> would recover faster since they diagnosed the cause of an infection they fear posed a new danger. They refused to disclose the nature of the infection. <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> still is using a temporary pacemaker attached after she suffered a heart attack on Sept. 8. She first developed chest pains and high fever Thursday just as doctors thought she was progressing well.

<TEXT>
 It may not be the crime of the century when your neighbor fails to corral his 45 cats or stocks his yard with junked cars, but it's the kind of crime Judge <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> understands. <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> runs one of at least 12 local courts around the country that focus exclusively on `` environmental'' cases: violations of sanitation, building or fire codes. `` It's been called the ` rat court,' and a large number of our cases do involve rat infestations,'' <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> said. He started his one-day-a-week environmental court in 1982 and spends a good bit of his time now telling other cities how to set up similar operations. `` These matters can be very important even though what we generally think of as environmental problems are toxic wastes,'' <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> said. `` These are cases that affect us all on a day-to-day basis. Cities nationwide are contacting us. It's a concept whose time has come.'' <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>, a city judge, uses his court to force reluctant landlords to maintain their property, make would-be trash dumpers shy away from vacant lots and even force lazy homeowners to mow their lawns. It takes a bit of creative judicial work since municipal courts like <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>'s have limited powers. He can put people in jail only in extreme cases and for short periods of time, and the fines he can impose for a single violation are small. But <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> said he discovered early on that he can string those small fines into a big one if he decides a person is guilty of a `` continuing violation.'' If, for example, city inspectors show that the toilet in a rental apartment has been broken for a month, <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> can charge the landlord $ 50 for each day it did not work and each day it remains broken. `` Then you really do get their attention,'' he said. <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> lacks the authority to order a landlord to fix such a toilet but when he offers a dramatic cut in the cumulative fine, repairs are generally made in short order. All environmental cases filed with the city court go before <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> and he deals each Friday afternoon with 10 to 30 defendants. <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Beaty </PERSON>, state coordinator of a citizens' group called the <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>'s was one of the first two or three municipal courts in the country to put all environmental cases before the same judge. `` There are now at least a dozen and there may be 18 environmental courts or environmental dockets across the country,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Beaty </PERSON>, also the state representative for <ORGANIZATION> Keep </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beautiful </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a national environmental-quality group. Setting up an environmental court saves money, increases efficiency and helps assure that cases involving sewer leaks or fire hazards are given adequate attention, she said. `` If I were a judge and I had somebody in front of me for rape or burglary and the next case was somebody with litter in his yard, which am I going to be concerned with?'' Ms. <PERSON> Beaty </PERSON> said. And city inspectors who look for fire, housing or sanitation code violations are more vigorous when they know there is a judge who will hear their cases, she said. `` In the old days,'' she said, `` they used the courts as a bluff.'' Since the <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> court began its environmental docket, city inspectors have attended annual seminars on how to present their arguments to a judge, <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> said. And his Friday afternoon sessions, he said, often attract groups of spectators from citizens' organizations interested in neighborhood preservation. `` They do n't always win but they like to see that something is being done,'' he said. `` They felt for years that nothing was being done.''

<TEXT>
 War veterans, young people and Solidarity activists on Sunday quietly marked the 50th anniversary of the invasion of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The government appealed for dignified demonstrations, and the observations were small compared to those held Sept. 1 for the 50th anniversary of the Nazi invasion of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> that started World War II. But for Poles, Sept. 17, 1939, was just as tragic. When the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> entered from the east <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> was divided and millions were deported, killed, or forced to remain in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> after the war. `` May Sept. 17, 1939, never be repeated in any nation again,'' Cardinal <PERSON> Henryk </PERSON> <PERSON> Gulbinowicz </PERSON> told more than 100,000 pilgrims at an annual workers' Mass in the southern city of <LOCATION> Czestochowa </LOCATION>. The new Solidarity government, in an appeal on national television Saturday night, upheld the right to mark the event but urged that ceremonies be held in a calm manner. The appeal for calm was repeated throughout Sunday on the radio. In previous years, demonstrations on the anniversary were often broken up by police. In <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, about 1,000 people met at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier to lay wreaths representing the <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, the underground resistance force that fought both the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>; the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> chapter of Solidarity; and the Confederation for an Independent <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, a small independence group. `` Fifty years of spitting at our history. These are the effects of Sept. 1 and Sept. 17, the effects of the plot by the two biggest criminals in world history _ <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohdan </PERSON>, a Home Army veteran, told the crowd. Many of the same group later went to a monument in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Powazki </LOCATION> military cemetery for the more than 4,000 Polish officers killed by Soviet security forces in the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> forest in 1940 <PERSON> Bohdan </PERSON> said reconciliation with the Soviets would not be possible until `` they -LRB- Soviets -RRB- tell the truth'' about the massacre. The Soviets maintain the officers were killed by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>, while Polish and Western documents say the Soviets were responsible. In the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, supporters of the still-banned <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and other youth groups held a rally as did activists of Fighting Solidarity, a hard-line splinter group that opposes dialogue with Communists. This year, as a result of the more tolerant political climate in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, even hard-line newspapers such as the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Trybuna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ludu </ORGANIZATION> have carried reports on what happened during and after the Soviet invasion. Those facts have been well known to a large part of the Polish public for many years as a result of teachings in church, independent publications, and the experience of Poles who lived through the war. <PERSON> Trybuna </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludu </PERSON> said Saturday that the Soviet invasion resulted in repression and mass crimes involving millions of Poles. `` The date of Sept. 17 is deeply rooted in the consciousness of the Polish nation. Especially because the entry of Soviet troops was followed by growing repressions, and even mass crimes which involved millions of Poles,'' <PERSON> Trybuna </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludu </PERSON> said. Gradually, the party has been opening archives and treating the subject of the Soviet invasion and other painful events with greater frankness. In <LOCATION> Czestochowa </LOCATION>, Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told more than 100,000 workers that a decade of struggle for union rights had finally succeeded. Speaking at the end of a Mass at the <PERSON> Jasna </PERSON> <PERSON> Gora </PERSON> monastery, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said that `` We have come here to give thanks for our regained rights.'' A year ago, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told a smaller crowd that legal recognition of the long-banned union was `` very close.'' Solidarity then had just agreed to end a wave of strikes and enter into talks with authorities. The union was legalized and now Solidarity's <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Masowiecki </PERSON> heads the government as prime minister.

<HEAD>Armenia, Faced With Economic ``Blockade,'' Plans Appeal to Kremlin</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lawmakers in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, under virtual economic blockade from neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, met in emergency session Sunday to ask the Kremlin for help in restoring deliveries of food and fuel, activists said. On Saturday, the legislature of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> again laid claim to <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a hilly region mostly populated by Armenians that has been the focus of a bloody territorial conflict between the two <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> republics for the 18 months. Speaking by telephone from <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s capital, an editor at the official <ORGANIZATION> Armenpress </ORGANIZATION> news agency said that during the past 14 days, not a single freight car with cargo has arrived in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> over rail routes originating in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. The editor, who was cut off before he could give his name, said 5,000 freight cars were also overdue in the area of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> that was devastated by an earthquake in December. The earthquake killed 25,000 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless. Armenian activist <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON> said the republic's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, <PERSON> Suren </PERSON> <PERSON> Arutyunyan </PERSON>, told <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s legislature at the emergency session that `` during the past two months <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> has not been receiving food, construction materials or food due to the blockade.'' A resolution submitted for the Armenian Supreme Soviet's consideration denounces the blockade as `` an act of aggression'' and demands the national Moscow-based legislature take urgent measures to restore shipments to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> within 24 hours, <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON> said The special session of the Armenian legislature will also consider the situation in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, which was part of mostly Moslem <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> for more than 65 years despite its largely Armenian and Christian population. More than 100 people have died in ethnic bloodshed since <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> began fighting over the district in February 1988. In an attempt to end the killing, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> placed the district under its direct control in February. <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>'s parliament reaserted its right to rule <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> on Saturday, calling the district an integral part of the republic and noting that the Soviet Constitution classifies it as such. The intractable quarrel will be one of the thorniest problems faced by the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership when it meets Tuesday in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to try to redefine policy towards the country's more than 130 ethnic groups and seek solutions to ethnic conflicts. Soviet press accounts have commonly blamed the cutoff in freight shipments to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> on striking Azerbaijani railway workers. But the scope of the blockade indicates officials in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> either are taking an active part in it or are doing little to end it. State-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday that the single rail station in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, in the administrative center of <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, has been out of operation for 10 days because trains bound there are halted 13 miles away in the <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Agdam </LOCATION>. By road, `` convoys with fuel and food bound for <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> are stopped in the adjoining -LRB- Azerbaijani -RRB- areas,'' the radio added. For lack of fuel, farm work in the district has stopped, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> said. `` No fuel is available for private cars. Even ambulances, emergency service vehicles and police cars receive rationed fuel supplies,'' it said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON>, kidnapped at the age of 7 and forced to live as the sexually abused foster son of his abductor until he escaped seven years later, has been killed in a hit-and-run traffic accident. `` He sure led a rough life,'' <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Highway Patrol Sgt. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Balestra </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON>, who was returned to his parents less than 10 years ago and was the subject of an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> miniseries in May, titled `` I Know My First Name Is <PERSON> Steven </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Balestra </PERSON> said <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON>, 24, married and the father of two children, was killed Saturday when a car pulled into the path of his motorcycle on a highway between <LOCATION> Merced </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atwater </LOCATION>, some 70 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Balestra </PERSON> said officers believe they knew the identity of the driver of the car, who abandoned his car two miles away, jumped into another car and fled. He said felony hit-run charges were planned. The officer said the car had pulled out of a private driveway and crossed in front of <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON>, who then ran into it. <PERSON> Balestra </PERSON> said <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON>, who the <ORGANIZATION> CHP </ORGANIZATION> reported had been riding without a helmet, `` suffered massive head injuries'' and was pronounced dead on arrival at <ORGANIZATION> Merced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. In 1972, when he was 7, <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON> was grabbed off a street in Merced while walking home from school. Seven years later, his abductor snatched another boy, 5-year-old <PERSON> Timmy </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>; 16 days later, on March 1, 1980, <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON> walked into a <LOCATION> Ukiah </LOCATION> police station with <PERSON> Timmy </PERSON>, saying he did n't want the younger boy subjected to the same abuse he experienced. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON>, arrested while working as a hotel clerk in <LOCATION> Ukiah </LOCATION>, 150 miles from <LOCATION> Merced </LOCATION>, was convicted of two counts of kidnapping. He was sentenced to eight years and eight months in prison in February 1982 after a sensational 18-day trial in <LOCATION> Hayward </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON> served five years in prison, then was paroled for another two years. Released from parole, <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON>, now 57, is believed living somewhere in northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. He had previously been imprisoned for sexually abusing an 8-year-old boy he kidnapped in <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>. While no sex charges were filed against <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON> testified at <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON>'s trial that he was ordered to call <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON> `` dad'' during his captivity and that he was regularly sexually abused. He said they lived in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> motels and trailer parks during the period. He said <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON> convinced him a court had awarded him custody because <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON>'s family could no longer afford him. Because he had been taught that adults do n't lie, <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON> said, he believed <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON>'s story and did n't realize he had been kidnapped. `` I felt a little guilty being the one to turn him in after all he'd given me all those Christmases,'' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> said in an interview several years later with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was hard to face him.'' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON>'s remorse turned to anger after he returned home to his parents, three sisters and a brother, `` and saw what I had missed out on all those years. Then I felt good about it and proud that I turned him in.'' His parents, however, found that their sunny, obedient 7-year-old had become a tough 14-year-old who liked to smoke, drink, hitchhike and party as late as he pleased. He later ran up $ 1,100 in traffic fines and lost his driver's license. In 1985, <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON> married <PERSON> Jody </PERSON> <PERSON> Edmondson </PERSON> in <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>. At the time of his death, he and his wife were living with their two children, age 2 and 3. <PERSON> Stayner </PERSON> had a walk-on role as a Merced police officer in the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> miniseries, which was broadcast May 21-22. In April, he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Democrat: `` My hope with the movie is that some kid sees it and gets up the nerve to tell someone and try to come home.'' He said he had hoped his life would not be depicted as a horror story. `` It was just not that way. I tried to make my life as normal as I could. I had a lot of good times when I was there. I was basically an everyday kid. I got into trouble. I ditched high school. I was like most kids except that I was n't with my natural parents.''

<HEAD>Angolan Rebel Leader Says Peace Talks Likely To Fail</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Angolan guerrilla leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> says Zairean President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sese </PERSON> <PERSON> Seko </PERSON>'s attempt to negotiate an end to the civil war in his country is likely to fail and another mediator should be found. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s remarks Saturday night appeared to rule out any hope that an African summit Monday in <LOCATION> Kinshasa </LOCATION>, the Zairean capital, would reinstate a truce in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war. `` I think <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> is not the only one who can make the reconciliation happen. ... I do n't see how he is going to continue. I think he is going to fail,'' <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> told reporters. Without naming anyone, <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> also said, `` time will prove that somebody was telling lies to one of the sides.'' At issue are claims that <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> agreed to go into exile and permit the integration if his guerrilla forces into the Angolan army. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> repeatedly has denied agreeing to either condition. His National Union for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> wants to contest elections to win a share in a government which, with Cuban and Soviet aid, fought its way to power when <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> colonizers hastily withdrew from the southern African nation in 1975. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> released a statement Sunday saying it `` strongly supports -LRB- the guerrillas -RRB- and its goals of national reconciliation followed by free and fair elections. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not accept the concept of ` exile, amnesty or integration,''' it said. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said he will not attend the <LOCATION> Kinshasa </LOCATION> summit, despite pressure from his backers in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, unless <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> disassociates himself from efforts to force him into exile. The Angolan rebels get $ 15 million a year from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, funneled through <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> also has given the guerrilla leader substantial assistance. But on Saturday, <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> of siding with Angolan President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>. He said it would be possible for someone else to take over the peace negotiations. `` We are for genuine reconciliation, for a lasting peace. If anyone will negotiate this ... We are for him,'' said <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>. He was in <LOCATION> Abidjan </LOCATION> for a meeting with Ivorian President <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Houphouet-Boigny </PERSON>, whom African diplomats said he favored to take over as mediator. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> also said fighting had intensified in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in the last two weeks with his guerrillas killing nearly 1,000 government troops while losing 300 men. Officials of the <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION> government also have reported increased fighting. Under an agreement mediated by <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>, a cease-fire began June 24. Fighting quickly resumed with <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> accusing the rebels of widespread violations. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> acknowledged some attacks, saying it was difficult to communicate with thousands of irregulars spread across the country, but also charged <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> with launching a major offensive. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> added that reports he had accepted money to go into exile had angered some of his supporters and provoked them to launch attacks despite the cease-fire. Several African heads of state have said <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> told them <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> had agreed to go into exile. The guerrilla leader said his troops have turned back an offensive by 10,000 government soldiers without help from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, whose troops would intervene before an agreement last year for the withdrawal of Cuban forces from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in return for Namibian independence.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> announced Sunday it had sent a team to the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> to determine whether emergency relief will be needed to cope with damage from Hurricane Hugo. A team of two people was on the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Antigua </LOCATION> and another two people have been sent to <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION>, an AID official said. `` The team in <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION> is carrying with them a portable satellite communications unit, which will enable them to relay disaster relief information and emergency needs from the disaster site back to'' the Office of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Foreign Disaster Assistance, AID announced in a news release. `` At the present time, no emergency relief aid has been requested by the affected islands,'' the announcement said. An AID worker, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Feller </PERSON>, said reports from <LOCATION> Antigua </LOCATION> indicated that by Sunday afternoon the storm had caused little damage. `` In the last conversation we had with our people in <LOCATION> Antigua </LOCATION>, they said there was a lot of wind and a lot of rain, but no one was hurt,'' said <PERSON> Feller </PERSON>. Asked whether AID planned to send food or other relief there, <PERSON> Feller </PERSON> said, `` It is not clear that it is needed. If it is needed, we can move very fast.'' According to dispatches from the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> hit the resort islands with 140 mph winds Sunday, tearing off roofs, knocking out communications and reportedly leaving 3,000 people homeless. The region's most powerful storm in a decade then swept toward the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>.

 Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said Sunday that while expanding individual retirement account benefits would be more politically popular, cutting the top capital gains tax rate would be of greater benefit overall. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press'' that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is `` on the right course'' pressing for a cut in taxes on profits from the sale of stocks, real estate and other investments. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last week approved the reduction. `` Let's create some jobs. Let's make the cost of capital cheaper,'' which would make the country more competitive on the world market, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. He conceded, though, that `` I assume the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> politically is more popular.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> said Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s proposal to restore partial tax deductions on contributions to IRAs is `` a great idea,'' but he said the proposal would cost $ 12 billion or more over a five-year period and `` where do you find the money?'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, defended his proposal on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Face the Nation,'' saying both his plan and the capital gains tax cut would lose money for five years before benefits would be seen. But he said his plan would help `` average folks _ far more people would be able to take advantage of it than could a capital gains cut.'' His proposal would allow a deduction of at least 50 percent for all <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> accounts and would allow the withdrawal of <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> funds without penalty _ even prior to retirement _ for a downpayment on the purchase of a first home or to finance college costs. `` What it really does is get those interest rates down in this country so we can be competitive with foreign nations,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` And it'd let people pay for that college education for their children and to buy that first home that's getting tougher and tougher to accomplish.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said his plan could be accomplished without raising taxes, but pressed on where the money would be found, he said, `` there's no way I can accomplish that on a show of this duration.'' On another controversial topic, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> found themselves in basic agreement, both saying they will try to block efforts to repeal the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> catastrophic program but will work to scale back benefits to reduce costs to senior citizens. `` I'm going to move the bill back to what it was when it was originally introduced,'' which would give <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> beneficiaries the option of taking the catastrophic insurance, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. Both senators said they want to reduce substantially or eliminate the surtax on <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> beneficiaries _ a maximum of $ 800, or $ 1,600 for a couple, this year _ that has raised intense and vocal opposition among the elderly. `` Let's do n't throw out all the benefits, because even though senior citizens are upset, they're going to need some of those benefits. We've got to provide the leadership, and we've got to take the heat for it,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, R-Ariz., a prime mover behind the program designed to protect the elderly against catastrophic illness, said he wants to see the surtax eliminated and the program scaled back to cover only hospitalization costs associated with a catastrophic illness and provisions that prevent a spouse from having to impoverish themselves to qualify for coverage Other provisions, including coverage of outpatient prescription drugs, should be stripped from the program to lower costs, he said. `` We've got to repeal the surtax, keep what we can, particularly catastrophic illness insurance, which is what we promised the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, and then go back and address the real issue that the seniors want in this country, and that's long term care,'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Newsmaker Sunday.'' `` I think there's a basic recognition that something needs to be done; the question is what,'' he said.

 East German and Czechoslovak authorities have begun seizing passports to stop the flood of refugees fleeing to the West, East German emigres said Sunday. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, meanwhile, defended his country's decision to aid the immigrant exodus and said the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact should stick to military defense and not dictate ideology or foreign policy to its members In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, officials said they registered 1,400 new East German refugees during the weekend, bringing to more than 16,000 the number of East Germans who have arrived since <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> threw open its borders to the West one week ago. East German officials have said they would not crack down on visas for citizens wishing to visit <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. But refugees and charity workers at camps in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> said travel documents were in fact being seized. `` More and more people are telling us that their visas are being taken from them,'' said <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, head of the West German Maltese Aid Service. `` Some have told me that state security had come to their apartments to take the visas.'' Others were forced off East German and Czechoslovak trains and returned home, <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said in an interview. A growing number were forced to swim the <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION> `` or find other illegal means of coming here,'' he said. Going through <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, between <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, is the most direct route for East Germans seeking to take advantage of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s open western border. A 25-year-old man from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> said he and 15 others entered <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> Saturday on foot after crowding into three cars and crashing through several Czechoslovak border barriers at the <LOCATION> Rajka </LOCATION> crossing, about 85 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>. He said police in <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION> took away their travel documents, and at one point they were held at submachine-gun point until they pledged they would not head toward the Hungarian border. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s role in the refugee affair has been condemned by hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> allies. A senior Communist foreign policy adviser here spoke of Soviet anxiety. `` It's a fact that there is noticeable worry on the part of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gyula </PERSON> <PERSON> Thuermer </PERSON> was quoted as saying in the Vasarnapi Hirek newspaper. `` They are worried that Hungarian events will become incalculable, and they are also disturbed that there are open disagreements among their allies.'' The Soviets have criticized <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> but have refrained from directly accusing <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> of wrongdoing. But <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, distrustful of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s plans to hold free elections in June and other reforms, have joined <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in condemning <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, however, is seeking stronger economic ties with the West and has embraced social and political reform. Hungarian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Gyula </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact should stop debating Communist ideology and concentrate on the East bloc's defense He was quoted by the Yugoslav daily <ORGANIZATION> Politika </ORGANIZATION> as saying the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact `` can not determine what foreign policy steps its individual members should take.'' `` The <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact should ... not deal with ideological issues, or with how the political situation in individual member countries is developing,'' he was quoted as saying. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s break with its hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> allies have won praise in the West, and West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> proposed Sunday a West European aid program of to support reforms in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, speaking in a radio interview, compared his proposal to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> Plan that helped reconstruct <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> after World War II. He said the plan should include food aid, rescheduling of credits and credit guarantees for Western investments. `` The aim of the plan should not be to enable those socialist states that refuse reforms to survive a bit longer, but to give a chance to reform-minded forces'' such as <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said in an interview with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> RIAS </ORGANIZATION> radio station. In <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, border authorities registered more than 1,600 East Germans Sunday who crossed during the night from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. West German border officials in <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> registered more than 1,400 weekend arrivals by early Sunday. The total number of East Germans who have used <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> for passage to freedom since early summer is thought to exceed 25,000, with many fleeing illegally after <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> demonstrated its opening to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in May by removing some border fortifications with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>.

 Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> will visit <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> to discuss President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s plan for ending the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories, officials said Sunday. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers shot and wounded 36 Palestinians during clashes Sunday with stone-throwing protesters in six villages and refugee camps. The army said it was checking the reports. During the 21-month-old uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, 572 Palestinians have been killed by soldiers or <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> civilians and 114 have been slain by fellow Arabs who suspected them of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Forty Israelis have been killed. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>'s trip Monday comes before an expected flurry of <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> diplomacy at the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> during which Israeli, Egyptian and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are to discuss <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s peace proposals. <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Freij </PERSON>, the Palestinian Mayor of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, returned Sunday from a trip to <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> where he said he urged <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to endorse <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s ideas. <PERSON> Freij </PERSON> is the first <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leader in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> to publicly announce a meeting with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, in defiance of an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> law that bans meetings with leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> reported. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials have said <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s 10-point peace plan, recently presented to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials, could be useful in reviving <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s proposal for Palestinian elections in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. But the Egyptian move also has caused a rift between the two major parties in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s coalition <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc opposes <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s demand that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> agree to trade land for peace. It also opposes giving Arabs in Israeli-annexed east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> the right to vote in <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> elections. The left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, headed by Vice Premier <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, accepts both points. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>'s trip, approved Sunday by the Cabinet, immediately touched off a new debate between the two parties. Recent media reports have portrayed the defense minister as an avid supporter of negotiations based on <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s plan. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> ministers met after the weekly Cabinet session and issued a statement rejecting <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s initiative, saying it gives too much ground to the Palestinians. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s election plan, presented to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in April, calls for choosing Palestinians to negotiate an interim peace for the occupied territories, with the final status of those territories to be decided later. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. The <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> proposal omits the question of future boundaries because of Likud opposition to withdrawing from the territories. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> has also offered to arrange a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> that would include two men recently deported from the occupied lands. The proposal is designed to satisfy both <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s demand that it meet only Palestinians from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s insistence that Palestinians from outside the territories be included in peace talks <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> officially refuses to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which it views as a terrorist group. `` If we keep making concessions, then all we do is move into a trap set by the Palestinians,'' said <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Modai </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s Economic Planning Minister. `` A <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state would endanger our existence. It will not happen.'' Labor leaders, however, strongly urged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to agree to negotiations based on <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s plan as a way to end an impasse in peace efforts. `` In my view, for the first time there is a chance for a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation to negotiations,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. Egyptian Ambassador <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bassiouny </PERSON>, who extended the invitation to <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, said Sunday: `` Of course Mr. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> is a key in the peace process ... Now the ball is on the Israeli side. If you -LRB- <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> -RRB- agree, next month you will see an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> delegation and a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation meeting in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> to discuss and talk about these problems. `` Can you imagine,'' <PERSON> Bassiouny </PERSON> added, `` next month the wheels of peace will start.'' The <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> government has formally agreed to put off a decision on the plan until <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> return from visits to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where both are expected to meet <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. The Egyptian plan has caused a split in the Palestinian side as well. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has announced it also will put off final judgment on the plan until October, but the Moslem fundamentalist movement <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION>, or Zeal, has condemned it. `` No to <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s 10-point plan,'' said graffiti signed by <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> and scrawled on a wall Sunday in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. The clashes between troops and Palestinians Sunday came as Arabs observed a general strike called by <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> that shut down the occupied territories. It was called to mark the anniversary of the massacre of hundreds of Palestinians by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> allies in the <PERSON> Sabra </PERSON> and Chatila refugee camps in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in 1982.

<HEAD>Nursing Home Residents Recall Rescue From Flood Waters</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A 74-year-old woman says she never prayed as hard as she did when a flood sent water flowing beneath a door and under her wheelchair in the nursing home where she lives. `` I was yelling. I said, ` Look at the water coming under the door.' I had n't seen anything like this before,'' <PERSON> Blanche </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said. `` I told them then I was scared of airplanes, but that if one had come by last night I would have certainly have hopped on,'' she said of Friday night's flood, caused by a cloudburst that dropped almost 4 inches of rain in just two hours. Two children drowned during the flood in spite of the efforts of a human-chain rescue team, and at least 400 people were forced to evacuate. Elsewhere in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, floods in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> killed two people. Ms. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> was one of 168 residents evacuated from the <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Health Care of <LOCATION> Fayetteville </LOCATION> nursing home A number of shelters were set up around the city for them and other evacuees. Most of the nursing home residents had to be taken out by boat, though some were carried through the water and others were pushed out in their wheelchairs. A few of the able-bodied residents climbed atop a roof and waited for help. No injuries were reported, said <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON> <PERSON> Cross </PERSON>, the nursing home administrator. `` The lightning scared the daylights out of most of us,'' said nursing home resident <PERSON> Socrates </PERSON> <PERSON> Costas </PERSON>. `` Everybody was in a daze. I do n't know where all the volunteers came from, but they were a lot of help.'' Maintenance man <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Backman </PERSON> said water was nearly 56 inches deep in the nursing home's bottom floors. On Sunday, Police Lt. C.P. Ware of the situation: `` Everything's calm All emergency personnel have gone home.'' But Ms. <PERSON> Cross </PERSON>, who waded through muddy water in the nursing home's main halls Saturday while she waited for an insurance adjuster, said cleanup would be a big job. With furniture covered in mud and most of the food under water, she did n't expect residents to be back in their regular rooms right away. Mayor J.L. <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON> said 10 to 15 Marines from <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lejeune </LOCATION> who were on their way to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION> for an exercise had stopped and assisted the nursing home residents who were evacuated.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said Sunday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are trying to bolster their aid to anti-communist rebels by meeting with deposed Afghan King <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Radical Afghan guerrillas with bases in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> threatened to assassinate the former monarch if he tries to return and head a postwar government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The warring sides in Afghan's civil war commented after reports that an envoy of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> met with the exiled king in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> has lived in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> since his nephew seized power in a 1973 coup. In his remarks, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> talks with <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> were an attempt `` to bring fresh breath to the abortive military policy of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. government.'' He did not elaborate. However, the president also suggested <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> could have a role in a settlement. `` We have proposed that all forces within and outside the country, including <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>, take part in national reconciliation,'' <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s ruling Marxists and their Soviet backers have previously said the king could serve as compromise solution to head a transitional government. But hard-line rebels in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, warned <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> to stay away from his homeland. `` He takes a very grave risk of being shot,'' said <PERSON> Nawab </PERSON> <PERSON> Salim </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> party run by anti-American <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>. `` The mujahedeen -LRB- holy warriors -RRB- will not let <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> come to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' After more than six months of trying to forge unity within the fractious guerrilla coalition, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> reportedly is considering alternatives, including the former monarch. But the rebels, who have received millions of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars in military and humanitarian aid during their decade-long war with successive communist governments, are bitterly divided over a possible role for the 74-year-old king. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON>, a spokesman for the guerrillas' government-in-exile, said a royal return is tantamount to a rebel defeat. `` It would mean the mujahedeen and the people of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> are defeated,'' said <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON>. Royalists among the rebels, most notably <PERSON> Syed </PERSON> <PERSON> Gailani </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, say the king is the only Afghan able to rally warring factions. <PERSON> Asim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser-Zia </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Gailani </PERSON>'s group, predicted <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> will fly to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> in January or February and retire after convening a traditional Afghan council to oversee general elections. This could happen only after <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> was out of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, he said. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s army chief of staff, Gen. <PERSON> Mirza </PERSON> <PERSON> Aslam </PERSON> <PERSON> Beg </PERSON>, said Sunday the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> appears willing to abandon <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. In a briefing for reporters, Beg said <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil magnate and confidante of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s powerbrokers, `` indicated the Soviets may drop <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>.'' He recommended the Afghan resistance negotiate with remaining leaders of the Afghan Communist groups after <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> is removed. Talks with the ruling communists represent a radical departure from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s earlier policies and is rejected by all rebels, regardless of political leanings. The rebels have their headquarters in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which also shelters more than 3 million Afghan refugees. <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> charged <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>'s possible return is a compromise being considered by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> because the superpowers are anxious to extricate themselves from the Afghan war. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> fears a `` so-called fundamentalist'' government, said <PERSON> Salim </PERSON>, whose organization is one of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s greatest critics but also is one of the major benefactors of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> largesse `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is trying to impose him -LRB- <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> -RRB- on the people of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Salim </PERSON>, calling the monarch a `` traitor.'' The king's greatest crime, according to critics, was to keep silent during the war, particularly after 1979 when <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> sent more than 110,000 soldiers into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` He never cared about the jihad -LRB- holy war -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON>. `` He never participated practically.'' The Kremlin withdrew its last troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on Feb. 15 under a U.N.-brokered accord. Many observers expected the move to lead to a guerrilla victory, but the divided resistance has not captured any major towns since the Soviet pullout. But a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Jamiat-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla faction, <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherdul </PERSON>, said 400 government soldiers surrendered to rebels in western <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION> province.

It was the first time the British universities raced each other in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The official races are held in March on the <LOCATION> Thames </LOCATION>. The crews had some time to socialize and see the sights of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cheveley </PERSON> said. `` But when we get to racing together, there's no love lost on the water.'' As the <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> team stepped up to collect their trophies, they hoisted their 113-pound coxswain _ or steerman _ on their shoulders and tossed him into the river. `` I did a good job, so that's why,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Watts </PERSON>, 20, of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, as he pulled himself up and wrung himself out.

<HEAD>Priest to Maintain Dress Code Policy Despite Archbishop's Request</HEAD>

 A Roman Catholic priest said Sunday he would continue enforcing a dress code at his church despite orders from his archbishop that he stop refusing Holy Communion to people he considers inappropriately dressed. The Rev. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Griese </PERSON> has barred shorts and mini-skirts from <LOCATION> Sacred </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heart </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION> and has turned away from Communion people he considers immodestly dressed. `` I do not refuse the Sacrament ... solely on the grounds of inappropriate dress, but rather on the unworthy motive of confrontation and attack which the wearers of inappropriate dress insist on wearing, even after several warnings,'' <PERSON> Griese </PERSON> said. `` And this, in simple conscience, I can not change.'' <PERSON> Griese </PERSON> told his congregation that <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON>, the archbishop of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, has threatened him with suspension and loss of his pastorate. `` He threatens me with removal,'' <PERSON> Griese </PERSON> said. `` Well, we'll see. He does n't have the right to do that when a person is innocent and has done no wrong. `` If I'm going to be insulted by my own authorities, by my own mission and staff, I have the right to make an appeal to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. And I wo n't have any hesitancy about doing that,'' he said. <PERSON> Griese </PERSON> read a letter from <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON> to the congregation at the end of Sunday's Mass. In the letter, <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON> told <PERSON> Griese </PERSON> that he too believes people should come to church appropriately dressed. He said he also believes it is proper for priests to remind churchgoers of the respect owed to the church. `` At the same time, I do not believe that guidelines for dress can and should be enforced by refusing the Sacraments to people,'' wrote <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON>. `` I have indicated this to you and pointed out that in the future you may not refuse Holy Communion or absolution in the Sacrament of Penance purely on the grounds of inappropriate dress. `` I suspect that you do not agree with this, but as an obedient priest you have said that you will carry out my wishes,'' the letter said. <PERSON> Griese </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON> of `` letting down the bars'' and rewarding confronters by chastising a loyal priest who is simply upholding reverence for the church. `` I shall not have that on my conscience,'' <PERSON> Griese </PERSON> said. `` And no man has the authority or power to force another man's conscience.'' The 73-year-old <PERSON> Griese </PERSON> said the controversy has caused him to lose sleep and miss meals. `` -LRB- But -RRB- I'm at peace with God as to what I've done and how I've done it,'' he said `` And if that does n't please the archbishop, then I'm very sorry. But I have to follow my conscience.'' <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, spokesman for the archdiocese, said <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON> plans to review Sunday's events at Sacred Heart and that no statement was immediately planned.

<HEAD>Government Offers Cease-Fire if Extremists Agree to Peace Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government on Sunday offered a unilateral cease-fire to Sinhalese extremists if they join an interparty peace conference that began last week. A statement by the president's office said `` there will be no need for the armed forces to continue their ongoing security operations'' if leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> attend the conference. President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> called the meeting in an effort to end ethnic strife that has taken 16,000 lives in six years. The inaugural session Wednesday was attended by 21 of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 27 recognized parties. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> rejected <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s invitation but the president said he hoped it will attend later sessions. The meetings are expected to continue through Oct. 12. The latest government truce offer came as military officials said more than 300 people were killed last week in attacks by <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> extremists and reprisal raids by pro-government vigilante groups. Vigilantes reportedly killed 150 people in repeated attacks on three <LOCATION> Kandy </LOCATION> district villages on Friday and Saturday, apparently in retaliation for the killing of three soldiers' relatives in <LOCATION> Kandy </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> gunmen. The government did not confirm the attacks on <LOCATION> Menikhinna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kundasala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Aranagala </LOCATION>, 50 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. But a senior military official said the government had ordered a major crackdown on vigilante groups. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said 45 members of the armed forces were arrested on suspicion of participating in vigilante groups. `` It is evident the current situation is being exploited by unidentified armed groups for their own purposes. This has led to a proliferation of weapons in our society. A positiive response by the Front to the call for peace and normalcy will enable the identification of these groups,'' the presidential statement said. A separate government statement Sunday said 16 bodies of young Sinhalese men were found in southern towns with notes nearby purportedly signed by the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is one of five known pro-governement groups. The government has denied it supports the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> or other groups such as the Black Cats, Yellow Cats, <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> and the People's <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. Opposition lawmakers and human rights organizations claim the government encourages such groups to intensify the crackdown on the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, an ultranationalist guerrilla group trying to overthrow the government. A military offical said the death toll during the week passed 300. He said 100 buildings were also burned in seven days, the worst week of violence in recent months. Independent sources said the death toll exceeded 350 and 250 buildings were burned. The government says more than 5,000 people have been killed in the two-year campaign by the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and blames the extremists for most deaths. The Front says vigilantes are responsible for many killings. <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> rebels began their campaign of assassinations and terrororist attacks to protest the government's peace overtures to Tamil secessionists in the northeast. The Front said an accord two years ago that was sponsored by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> made too many concessions to the minority Tamils, who comprise 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people. <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> leaders also opposed the presence of Indian peacekeeping soldiers, deployed in the northeast to supervise the 1987 accord. The largest Tamil group, <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, reneged on the accord and began attacking the Indian troops. At least 1,000 Indian soldiers have been killed in the fighting. The Tamil rebels are attending the peace conference. The Tamil secession, which began in 1983 with complaints of discrimination in jobs and education by the Sinhalese-dominated government, has claimed up to 10,000 Sri Lankan lives. Sinhalese, most of whom are Buddhists, make up 75 percent of the population and control the government and the military. Tamils are predominantly Buddhists. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> became involved in the ethnic problems of its southeastern neighbor because of the sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils to the rebel cause.

 Tens of thousands of Ukrainian Catholics on Sunday joined in their church's biggest service since World War II to demand that <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s government restore their legal status and end decades of repression. The two-hour outdoor Mass in the Ukrainian city of <LOCATION> Lvov </LOCATION> came on the 50th anniversary of dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s annexation of the western <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Western witnesses said the Mass drew up to 100,000 participants. A Ukrainian activist said 200,000 people gathered at a later prayer session. At dusk, about 30,000 Ukrainians carrying candles ringed a central square at <LOCATION> Lvov </LOCATION>'s opera theater and observed a half-hour of silence to commemorate victims of the 1939 Soviet takeover and the purges that followed. Candles of mourning also twinkled in some apartment windows of the city of 650,000 people. The action was designed to mirror Aug. 23 demonstrations in the three Baltic republics in which more than 1 million Estonians, <LOCATION> Lithuanians </LOCATION> and Latvians joined hands to protest the annexation of their lands. The <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> both fell into the Soviet orbit as a result of a secret pact between <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and Nazi German Dictator <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>. `` Tonight let us all turn off the electricity and put a candle in the window to commemorate the millions who died under Stalinist repression,'' Ukrainian Catholic activist <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gel </PERSON> told the worshipers in <LOCATION> Lvov </LOCATION>. `` Those candles will also symbolize the great hopes we have for our one, our dear <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>.'' `` The time has come for freedom for our church,'' declared Gel, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ukrainian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. The Ukrainians carried at least 300 blue-and-yellow flags of their once independent homeland, along with crosses, images of the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> and banners reading `` freedom for our church.'' The outdoor service under an overcast sky was only the latest sign of reviving nationalist consciousness in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s second-most populous republic, where a new grassroots pro-democracy group called Rukh held its founding congress last week The Ukrainian Church, sometimes called the <ORGANIZATION> Uniate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, has up to 5 million members by some Western estimates, and is said to be the largest banned religious organization in the world. In 1946, it was accused of widespread collaboration with the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> and forced to merge with the <LOCATION> Lvov </LOCATION> synod of the Russian Orthodox Church. The Ukrainian church's property was confiscated and believers who refused to accept `` the reunion'' were brutally repressed or driven underground. Despite greater official tolerance of religion since President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> became Soviet leader in March 1985, the Ukrainian church is still officially banned. In May, about 200 church members including Gel held a hunger strike on a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> street to demand legal recognition for their faith. In a statement, hunger strikers charged authorities in the western <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> with waging `` administrative terror'' against <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priests and believers who petition <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for legalization. They said some priests were being placed under administrative arrest for up to 15 days. The church's fate has been a major obstacle to improved relations between the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>. In June, Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, in a clear reference to <LOCATION> Ukrainian </LOCATION> believers, deplored state policies that deny Eastern Rite Catholics the freedom of worship. The Ukrainians' status under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms is likely to be a central issue at talks reportedy to be held between the pontiff and the Soviet leader when they meet for the first time during a November trip by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Lvov </LOCATION>, the worshipers walked three miles through the city's medieval center to pray outside <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yuri </LOCATION>'s cathedral, which epitomizes the plight of their church The sanctuary, once the seat of <LOCATION> Lvov </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishop, is now the cathedral of the local Russian Orthodox prelate. Gel estimated the worshipers numbered 200,000 by the time they reached <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yuri </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, a turnout he said was a triumph after more decades of repression and official disapproval. `` This is a moral victory,'' he said. `` Look how powerful our church is.'' Soviet control of the western <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> began Sept. 17, 1939, slightly more than two weeks after <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> started World War II by attacking <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and less than a month after he and <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> reached a non-aggression agreement with a secret protocol dividing <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> into spheres of influence. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> moved into <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> along a broad front of what is now the western Soviet republics of the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION>. In 1940, Soviet tanks rolled into the Baltic republics. Armed bands held out against <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> power in the forested hills of the western <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> until almost a decade after the war's end in 1945.

 Soviet politician <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> wrapped up an eight-day tour of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Sunday, and said he had found Americans to be `` industrious, friendly, full of good humor and vitality.'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s first visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> included meetings with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, meetings with <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials, speaking engagements at colleges and a trip to an American grocery store. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, an outspoken critic of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, spoke Sunday to about 500 people at a $ 100-a-plate luncheon sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. He said the political situation in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was `` extremely difficult'' and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was `` on the verge of crisis.'' `` We have not seen an evolution of power from the party to the congress,'' said <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, a member of parliament and former member of the ruling Politburo. `` The party has got to be subordinate to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> ... That's because the Politburo is leaning too far to the right and pulling <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> with it,'' he said through an interpreter. While <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> assailed the conservative elements in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that were stalling reform, he assured, `` We are profoundly convinced that glasnost and democratization of our society are inevitable processes.'' The luncheon was the last event scheduled for <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, who was to leave <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> later Sunday en route to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> on Saturday, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> followed a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials about possible U.S.-Soviet space links with an eye-opening visit to a grocery store, saying such plenty could cause a revolution in his country. `` Even the Politburo does n't have this choice,'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said, as he looked over fish and meat at <PERSON> Randall </PERSON>'s Supermarket in <LOCATION> Clear </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, near the Johnson Space Center. `` Not even Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>.'' When he roamed the grocery store aisles, nodding his head in amazement at the array of food and other products, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> commented that if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people who stand in lines for groceries ever saw a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supermarket, `` there would be a revolution.'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> tasted free samples of cheese and produce and ogled rows of meat. `` We do n't have this much meat in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' he said. He stopped several shoppers and workers, asking about the food they selected and the cost. One store employee offered him a single yellow rose to remember his trip to the Lone <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and another gave him a bag of snacks. `` Is this what you give a starving Russian?'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> joked. `` You should add some soap; we need that, too.''

<TEXT>
 The U.S.-backed rebel force fighting <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government is disbanding but wo n't vanish all at once, despite a Central American peace accord, the Nicaraguan defense minister said Sunday. `` It wo n't be sudden, like an earthquake. They'll just dry up,'' <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He said only 500 rebels, known as Contras, turned themselves in under a repatriation program called for in last month's peace accord signed in <LOCATION> Tela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, by five Central American presidents. But he said the Contra force was crumbling through quiet desertion. `` A lot of them do n't trust us enough to turn themselves in. They're just putting their guns away and waiting to see what happens,'' said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, who represented <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s Independence Day celebrations The Central American presidents signed the agreement Aug. 7 that called for dismantling the Contras, most of whom are based in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> along the border with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. In return, Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> promised democratic elections, now scheduled for Feb. 25. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said the opposition coalition's presidential candidate, <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrios </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, was allied with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests. Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> is the widow of <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, whose assassination helped spark the Sandinista revolution that overthrew President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> in July 1979. She served on the first post-revolutionary junta but resigned after a year and joined the opposition that formed mainly because of the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> surge to the left and its links with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> party will choose its candidate on Sept. 24. He said he thought his brother, President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, would be the best nominee. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s nomination is considered a virtual certainty. When asked what the army would do if Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> and the opposition wins, <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said the defense forces would not try to control the government. But, he said, the Sandinista army `` will never be an army that serves a dominant class.'' The Aug. 7 agreement calls for dismantling the Contras by Dec. 8, but <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said their complete demobilization was unlikely. He added if the Honduran base camps are shut the rebellion will eventually die out. `` We've already reached a state of relative peace,'' he said. `` Once we hold elections we'll be able to reach a state of complete peace.'' The defense minister said about 60 people, including civilians, soldiers and rebels, were killed in fighting in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> last month. He said there have been about 50 clashes a month between troops and rebels, down from about 500 monthly before the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> cut off military aid to the Contras in 1988. Non-lethal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid is scheduled to continue through February. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> estimated the number of Contras in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> at 2,000 and the number in Honduran camps at 4,500, about one-quarter the number Contra leaders claim. Journalists estimate there were more than 6,000 fighters in the main Contra camp in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> last month, down sharply from more than 10,000 in February.

 A bus carrying West German tourists spending a week in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> skidded off a highway on Sunday and overturned, injuring 23 people, police said. There were no serious injuries among the 24 passengers on the <ORGANIZATION> Bluebird </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> bus, which apparently slid on wet pavement on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thruway </LOCATION> and rolled onto its side, said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said speed and a roadway made slick by two days of rain contributed to the accident, but said police are n't sure what caused the accident. Rescuers from the <ORGANIZATION> Bowmansville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said about half of the passengers had already walked off the bus, but the rest had to be freed by way of a 6-by-4-foot hole that rescue personnel cut through the bus roof. The passengers from <LOCATION> Wurzburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, arrived in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> on Friday night to begin their trip to <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wurzburg </LOCATION>'s sister city in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> sister cities program coordinator <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuchs </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fuchs </PERSON> said the group visited <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> on Saturday and was headed to <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> when the accident occurred Sunday morning.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A North Korean civilian, described by <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> authorities as a spy escort, defected to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> early Sunday across the 2.5 mile-wide Demilitarized Zone, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announced. It said <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> <PERSON> Yong </PERSON> chul, a member of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s ruling Workers' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Party, surrendered at a South Korean marine outpost on <LOCATION> Kanghwa </LOCATION> island at 3:45 a.m. after swimming across a river on the western border Ministry spokesman <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ji-wook </PERSON> identified <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> as an escort of North Korean agents sent to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for espionage. He gave no further details. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> accuses <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> of frequently sending spies across the <ORGANIZATION> DMZ </ORGANIZATION>, established under the truce that ended the Korean War in 1953. <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> was the seventh North Korean to defect to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in less than two months. In the latest incident on Sept. 10 three <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> _ an army second lieutenant, a staff sergeant and a civilian nurse _ crossed through a minefield inside the <ORGANIZATION> DMZ </ORGANIZATION> and swam across a river on the westen front <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, in a report monitored in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Sunday, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sent a new ambassador, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to help stop the anti-American movement. The official <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <PERSON> Rodong </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinmun </PERSON> described <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> as `` an old ` secret agent' who has accumulated experience in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> for nearly 30 years.'' It said the `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imperialists have dispatched <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> with a view to quelling the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> people's anti-American sentiment for independence and reunification `` with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> arrived Saturday to take up his post in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, where he served as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> CIA station chief in 1973-76. There have been increasing demands by some <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> political groups for withdrawal of the 43,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense treaty. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said on arrival, `` As long as the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government and the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> public share with us the judgment that there is a need for our presence, we will be here to assist in maintaining peace on the peninsula.'' The peninsula was divided at the end of World War II in 1945 into the communist North and capitalist South. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was one of 16 nations that sent troops to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s aid after <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> invaded in 1950. American troops remained to help in defense after the war ended in an armistice in 1953.

<TEXT>
 Two oil tankers collided off the northeast coast of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> early Sunday, caught fire and spilled more than 300,000 gallons of crude oil into the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, the coast guard said. No injuries were reported aboard the Liberian-registered <LOCATION> Phillips </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> or the Maltese-registered <PERSON> Fiona </PERSON>, and authorities expressed confidence the 20-mile-long by seven-mile-wide oil slick could be dispersed. Six aircraft sprayed the spreading slick with dispersants throughout the day. A coast guard spokesman said much of the oil had broken into patches and there were no reports of oil coming ashore. The <PERSON> Fiona </PERSON>, which anchored when the early morning collision occurred, was damaged in the bow while the <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, which was moving, was damaged in the stern, said coast guard spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Clempson </PERSON>. He would not comment on who was responsible for the collision. He said an investigation would be conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Clempson </PERSON> said helicopters flew 20 firemen to the vessels, and five fire-fighting tugs were at the scene. Five British minesweepers on a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> exercise were put on standby. Firefighters said it took more than three hours to contain the flames aboard the <LOCATION> Phillips </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, but the fire aboard the <PERSON> Fiona </PERSON> was quickly controlled. By mid-morning, <PERSON> Clempson </PERSON> said, the <LOCATION> Phillips </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> fires had been extinguished and the source of the oil leakage had been stopped. Both ships were at anchor off Spurn Head in the Mouth of the Humber, about 150 miles north of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 66 </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, operators of the <LOCATION> Phillips </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, said the oil spilled from a slop tank through a hole two yards above the waterline. `` Most of that will have probably been burnt up in the fire,'' <PERSON> Clempson </PERSON> said. `` The way it is heading it does n't appear to be coming ashore.'' The <LOCATION> Phillips </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> carried 56,000 tons of crude oil, and the <PERSON> Fiona </PERSON> had 46,500 tons of refined oil aboard, <PERSON> Clempson </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> said aerial surveys indicated the spill was minor. Seventeen of 26 crew members were evacuated from the <LOCATION> Phillips </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. One crew member from the <PERSON> Fiona </PERSON> was recovered from the sea by the minesweeper HMS <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON> after he jumped overboard. He was being treated for shock, and the rest of the ship's 30-member crew remained aboard.

<HEAD>Remains Of Four Civil War Soldiers Reburied At Antietam Battlefield

<DATELINE>SHARPSBURG, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The remains of four Union soldiers were reburied at the <ORGANIZATION> Antietam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battlefield </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday, the 127th anniversary of an 1862 Civil War bloodbath. Relic seekers from <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> discovered the remains of the front-line soldiers in March 1988, and anthropologists and archaeologists have been studying them since. On Sunday, the remains were sealed inside a plain, pine coffin and buried with full military honors at <ORGANIZATION> Antietam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION>. An estimated 450 people watched the Civil War funeral at the 11-acre hilltop cemetery near <LOCATION> Sharpsburg </LOCATION>, where the remains of nearly 4,700 soldiers are buried. The four soldiers found were members of the Irish Brigade from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which charged the Confederate line Sept. 17, 1862, and were killed by rifle fire. They were among more than 23,000 Union and Confederate soldiers who were killed, wounded or missing after the Battle of <ORGANIZATION> Antietam </ORGANIZATION>, which climaxed Gen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s two attempts to push the war farther north. The battle is described as the single bloodiest day of the war. `` The massive number of dead in the battle made the interment paramount,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Frye </PERSON>, a historian with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` They did not have time to properly bury individuals with independent memorial services.'' <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Owsley </PERSON>, a forensic anthropologist at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>'s Museum of Natural History, determined that two of the fallen soldiers were in their 20s, one was in his 30s and the other was about 45 years old. `` The older fellow had arthritis in his shoulder bones,'' he said. `` This was a very unique opportunity because you have the ability to associate with the men who went into battle,'' <PERSON> Owsley </PERSON> said. `` Normally, you have the artifacts without the bones.'' About 85 men from re-enactment units representing the 28th <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and the 93rd <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> regiments camped at <LOCATION> Antietam </LOCATION> and assisted with the burial and a Roman Catholic Mass. The morning service was held along `` Bloody Lane,'' a sunken road in the middle of the battlefield where intense fighting occurred for nearly four hours that day. `` Re-enactors normally re-enact history, but today we are making history,'' said <PERSON> Collin </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> Centreville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, who served as a commander for the event. `` This is the first Civil War burial that the park has had this century. The re-enactors who are here are making history.'' A hazy ridge of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> provided a distant backdrop for the Mass. The coffin, which rested on sawhorses, was covered with a 34-star American flag. Some of the soldiers, dressed in navy coats and light blue slacks, knelt on one knee during the service. Smoke from morning campfires filled the air. Pallbearers placed the coffin on a horse-drawn cart drapped in black, and the soldiers donned black arm bands before starting a milelong procession from Bloody Lane to the cemetery. The group marched to a somber beat of drums draped in black.

 Police killed 11 people Sunday during fighting between members of rival Hindu castes in the southern state of <LOCATION> Tamil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nadu </LOCATION>, authorities reported. They said those deaths raised to 20 the number of people killed in two days of violence between the two groups. Police fired at mobs in three places in <LOCATION> Madurai </LOCATION> district of <LOCATION> Tamil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nadu </LOCATION>, killing nine people, a police spokesman said. Two people were crushed to death under a police jeep that drove into an attacking mob, said the spokesman, who was not identified under police regulatins. <LOCATION> Madurai </LOCATION> district is 250 miles south of <LOCATION> Madras </LOCATION>, the state capital. Nine people were killed Saturday in armed fights in the district between Brahmins and Harijans, two Hindu castes. Under the caste system, Brahmins consider themselves superior to Harijans. Police said the clashes broke out when a <LOCATION> Harijan </LOCATION> leader made speeches that Brahmins viewed as provocative. The leader, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pandiyan </PERSON>, has been arrested and charged with inciting communal violence, the police said.

 Moslem leaders and <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> patriarch voiced support for a new Arab peace proposal Sunday, but <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> army commander <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> rejected key parts of the plan and fighting continued. Police said one person was killed and 14 were wounded in nightlong artillery clashes in and around <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. That raised the toll to at least 915 killed and 2,699 wounded since the latest fighting broke out on March 8. Gen. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> rejected key clauses of the seven-point peace plan announced Saturday by a three-member Arab League committee. In a televised interview, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said he would not appoint a representative to a <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> security committee that would oversee a cease-fire under the peace plan. `` I wo n't accept at all a Lebanese-Lebanese committee. This is what the <ORGANIZATION> Syrians </ORGANIZATION> wanted to deceive the world and say the clashes have been among Lebanese factions,'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has refused to take part in a security committee, maintaining the conflict is between <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and his Lebanese foes. But Syrian troops, in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping mandate, allied with Moslem militias as a main party in the latest violence. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> also criticized the committee's call for <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to meet outside <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to discuss political reforms demanded by the Moslems. `` First <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> should be free of all occupations, then reforms could be worked out,'' he said. That was a reference to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which controls a border strip in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said he would abide by the cease-fire if <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> did. `` If they do n't put away their guns, we'll continue to respond to their fire.'' He renewed his attack on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, saying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government was covering up for <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> withdrew its embassy staff from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Sept. 6 after Christian demonstrators surrounded the embassy compound demanding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action to help drive the Syrians out. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, Prince <PERSON> Saud </PERSON> <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON>, arrived unexpectedly Sunday in the Syrian capital, <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, for talks with Syrian leaders on putting the peace plan into effect. He delivered a letter to President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> from King Fahd of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, according to officials who would not disclose its contents. He then met with Vice President <PERSON> Abdul-Halim </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaddam </PERSON>, architect of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s military intervention in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Saud </PERSON> was to fly to <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> later Sunday for discussions in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s archrival and <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s weapons supplier. The Arab League committee comprising Fahd, <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> apppealed urgently Saturday for an immediate cease-fire. Its several previous calls for a truce have been ignored. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem vying for power with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, welcomed Saturday's call. He called it `` a chance to end the crisis that might not be repeated.'' The plan does not call for <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to withdraw its 40,000 troops, whom <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> charges have betrayed their mandate by siding with the Moslems. The <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> statement also said Algerian diplomat <PERSON> Lakhdar </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Ibrahimi </PERSON> will head a security committee to supervise the cease-fire and monitor ships to ensure no weapons reach the warring factions. That will affect <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> more than the Syrians. His only supply route is by sea, as the enclave's three landward sides are ringed by Syrian forces and their allies. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s supply lines run through territory it controls. Fahd, <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> called on `` all parties'' to stop arming the warring factions and said they have received `` positive responses in this regard.'' Patriarch <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON>, spiritual leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> sect, thanked the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee for `` the great effort it is exerting to silence the guns.'' Shiite Moslem militia chieftain <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s main allies in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said he `` welcomes the security arrangements included in the committee's plan, which are capable of halting the cycle of violence.'' Current fighting in the 14-year-old civil war erupted when <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> blockaded illegal ports run by Moslem militias and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> responded by besieging the 310-square-mile Christian heartland north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee has invited <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 99 legislators to meet Sept. 30 to `` discuss and prepare'' political reforms to end the war that has killed more than 150,000 people. Maronites have dominated Lebanese politics since independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943, when Christians were considered the majority. Now Moslems constitute about 55 percent of the country's 4 million people and demand political equality.

 More than 2,000 Nicaraguan exiles greeted Nicaraguan presidential candidate <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrios </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> on Sunday in her first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visit since being nominated as leader of the anti-Sandinista factions. Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, wife of slain newspaper publisher <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, was mobbed by supporters when she arrived in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, a city that received an influx of more than 100,000 impoverished Nicaraguan refugees last year. She criticized the Sandinista government for human rights violations and for causing the country's economic problems, and she appealed to Nicaraguans abroad to consider returning to their homeland if her opposition party is successful in the Feb. 25 elections. `` The hour has sounded for liberty in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' she told the crowd in Spanish. `` But the liberty is for Nicaraguans and the reconciliation of all the people.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>'s visit came two days after the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration bowed to congressional pressure and abandoned a plan to funnel about $ 2 million in government funds to her campaign through the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-financed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>. But administration officials say they will encourage private and foreign groups to donate money to Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, an anti-government coalition known by its Spanish initials <ORGANIZATION> UNO </ORGANIZATION>, selected Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> as its presidential candidate earlier this month. The Sandinistas are expected to endorse President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> for re-election. Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, 59, a Roman Catholic, pledged religious freedom and said her administration would emphasize a free-market economy in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, one of the poorest nation's in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>. She also called on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to grant work permits to Nicaraguan refugees. `` The communists are contrary to the history of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and the culture of the Nicaraguan people,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, who took over the daily <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> newspaper after her husband was gunned down in 1978. Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>'s detractors cite her political inexperience and her brief term in the revolutionary government. A small band of opponents who back other rebel leaders marched outside the amphitheater Sunday. A $ 100-a-plate fund-raising dinner for Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> was also planned for Monday in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Former Argentine President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> and former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> are expected to head a commission to supervise and observe the February elections.

 It took money to make money for a group of investors who financed a treasure hunt that struck as much as $ 1 billion worth of gold off the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> coast. The 106 investors in Recovery Limited Partnership, most from central <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, had to show a net worth of at least $ 750,000 or income over $ 200,000 per year for three years to be able sink money into the search for the SS <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, a paddle-wheel steamship that sank 132 years ago. But for those who qualified and made an investment at least $ 10,000 each, according to records filed in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the return promises to be substantial if the group's right to ownership of the gold is not overturned. The booty, which will take months to haul from 8,000 feet of water nearly 200 miles out in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, was three tons of government gold from the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mint </ORGANIZATION> plus fortunes that passengers made during the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gold Rush. The gold from the mint was being transported to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> via the Isthmus of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> when the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> sank during a hurricane Sept. 12, 1857. Of more than 575 people on board, only about 150 survived. Leaders of the expedition that located the wreck, the <ORGANIZATION> Columbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Discovery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, called the find the largest American treasure trove ever. Estimates of the cache's value range from several hundred million dollars to $ 1 billion. `` We've found it. Gold. Lots of it. We have hit the mother lode,'' underwater mining specialist <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomspon </PERSON>, a director of the group, wrote in a letter to investment group members. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> put up no money for the expedition but is entitled to 40 percent of the income from it, according to filings with the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was a high risk from day one. -LRB- But -RRB- because of <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON>'s detailed studies and efforts over the years, I felt that it had a fair success chance,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fanta </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> brokerage and a member of the investment group `` It is a tremendous technological achievement,'' Fanta said. A former research engineer at the <ORGANIZATION> Battelle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> took on an unpaid leave of absence to conduct the search. He and others pinpointed the wreck's location by cross-referencing news accounts of the day. The issue of who actually owns the gold is still not completely settled, but an admiralty court in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, has already ruled the <ORGANIZATION> Columbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> group </ORGANIZATION> owns the dozens of artifacts and trinkets previously hauled from the steamship. `` At this point, the court has not considered the artifacts recovered this month, that is to say the gold,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Robol </PERSON>, a lawyer for the group. `` The next step is a hearing on who is the owner of the gold.'' In another ruling favorable to the <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> group, Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellam </PERSON> last month made permanent an injuction prohibiting anyone else from entering the wreck site. The admiralty court is a civil court that rules on maritime law. <PERSON> Robol </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> that he and his co-counsel, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, would request a hearing on ownership of the gold, but said he did not know when he would make the request. ` The usual procedure, he said, is to have the determination of ownership on a number of different occasions as more and more items are brought up from a wreck, <PERSON> Robol </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, a historian who worked with the investors out of their <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> office, said the find is `` like a storybook treasure.'' <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> would n't mind if workers in the office _ who are not investors _ get to share a little of the wealth through a bonus of some sort. `` We're just depending on the kindness of strangers,'' she said.

 A small plane low on fuel crashed Sunday while trying to land on a highway in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, killing three men, and two people were killed in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> when their plane crashed between lanes of a freeway. A 6-year-old boy was the only survivor of the eastern <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> crash, said <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Deputy Sheriff <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON>. The boy was pulled from the plane after rescuers, carrying buckets of water from a nearby river, doused flames that had engulfed the aircraft. Truck drivers also stopped and used fire extinguishers. <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> said the rescuers lifted the aircraft by the tail section and one man crawled beneath and pulled the boy out. `` If it had n't been for them there's no doubt the child would have perished,'' <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> said. `` It was a heroic effort.'' The pilot, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Parmer </PERSON>, 47, informed flight controllers about 3:30 p.m. that he was low on fuel and trying to reach a landing strip at <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga </LOCATION>.

 The Butte, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> failed to follow procedures in granting money for housing projects, according to a recent audit by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. Because of the shortcomings, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> `` can not be sure'' money awarded for the projects was being spent `` in the most efficient and economical way,'' said the audit report released Aug. 21. The Butte housing authority operates 356 low-income housing units _ 214 for senior citizens and 142 for families. The assistance program provides money to improve their physical condition and upgrade their management. As of March 1989, $ 4.8 million had been approved for the projects. The audit was conducted in April and May of this year. The housing authority made budget changes without following written procedures, particularly concerning the addition to the 1986-87 budgets of $ 639,000 to remove lead-based paint and $ 100,000 to repair or demolish a building, the audit said. Because of those changes, other items budgeted for those years, such as $ 251,000 for water heaters and heating units, were postponed to 1988. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> regulations call for submission of a formal budget revision when a major change is made. The audit found that the Butte housing authority charged expenses to the wrong accounts, did n't keep adequate accounting records, did n't use available resources such as $ 17,000 worth of computer equipment, requested money before spending what it already had and failed to cancel invoices to ensure bills were n't paid more than once. The audit also determined that the authority did n't follow <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> requirements in awarding contracts. Among other discrepancies, the authority failed to advertise or obtain <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> approval for contracts over $ 10,000, as required. <PERSON> Butte </PERSON> did meet <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> requirements for developing and implementing a five-year plan to meet the projects' physical needs but did n't provide a rolling five-year plan, which would outline future financial needs The Inspector General's office instructed the <ORGANIZATION> Butte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> to provide within 60 days a report on action taken to remedy the problems or why action is not needed.

 The title is `` Carnage, A Comedy,'' as if authors <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> had to reassure theatergoers it was all right to laugh. Not many did at a preview of this messy, meandering and mirthless satire of religious evangelism that opened Sunday at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Shakespeare Festival Public Theater. The play comes from The Actors' Gang, an acting ensemble from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> that has been putting on productions since 1981 on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and performed `` Carnage'' at the <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Festival </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> before coming here. It was n't worth the trip. <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, an actor best known for the movie `` Bull Durham,'' and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> have concocted an unfunny and heavy-handed comic strip masquerading as a play. One of their main characters is a preacher named <PERSON> Cotton </PERSON> <PERSON> Slocum </PERSON>, a rotund, shaggy-haired charlatan who sells religion as if it were snake oil at a place called God's Happy Acre. `` This is not a non-profit organization,'' <PERSON> Slocum </PERSON> insists. `` This is a church.'' The minister and his carefully coiffured wife <PERSON> Tipper </PERSON> are always in the market for new ways to make money. He devises a Prayer Walk during which he will pound the pavement for the Lord as well as for monetary pledges to finance his new religious theme park. <PERSON> Slocum </PERSON>'s assistant is a right-wing zombie named Deacon Tack who trains paramilitary cadets on the side. The man combines the fervor of <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and the personality of <PERSON> Bela </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugosi </PERSON>. Mixed into this fanatic folderol is a sweet, dim-witted housewife named Dot who truly believes in <PERSON> Slocum </PERSON> and her husband <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON>, who participates in Tack's military maneuvers. They all come together in the desert during an incomprehensible second act. It deteriorates into lunatic ravings, mostly by Tack about the upcoming Armageddon in which the permissive society, as well as the Commies, will be vanquished. The acting is more enthusiastic than competent, but <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Arenberg </PERSON> is fine as the money-hungry minister, <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Holt </PERSON> projects the simple sincerity of the deluded housewife, and <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellamy </PERSON> is positively creepy as the looney deacon. But a smirkiness and condescension pervade the proceedings. What's more, the play ca n't compete with the real thing. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and all the rest of the people `` Carnage'' attempts to harpoon are much more theatrical _ and funnier _ in real life than anything <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> have put on stage.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is standing by its conclusion that a USS Iowa crewman probably deliberately caused a blast aboard the battleship that killed 47 men, despite a report that the battleship was being used for high-explosive experiments. Transcripts from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigation of the April 19 blast showed that an improper type of gun powder was being used experimentally when the explosion occurred inside the ship's No. 2 turret, which has three 16-inch guns, <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday `` Everything was very carefully considered,'' said Cmdr. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, who defended the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s official report on the explosion The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> report said circumstantial evidence indicated gunner's mate <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> intentionally sparked the explosion. However, the report said it would be impossible to prove because all those nearby died in the explosion, including <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>. But the detailed transcripts showed that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> command that requested the experiments _ the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> _ was the same agency that performed the tests that led to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s conclusion about the cause of the explosion, released earlier this month <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s family has requested a congressional investigation. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, who has consulted with the <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> family, said Sunday she will hold a meeting in her <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office with <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigators on Monday to question them about the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> report. `` We're concerned about the safety of the individuals aboard any of these battleships,'' she said. `` We've known for some time now there were some questions about that gunpowder ... It certainly appears they did n't continue their own investigation. Everything leads to asking them why they did n't conclude that some of it was their fault.'' The 7,007 pages of transcripts of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigators and interviewees was made available to the public, but only at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and only for one day, the day the official report was issued. The transcripts showed <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> gunners were firing an experimental load from the No. 2 turret with high-strength powder not approved for the weight of the projectile. According to the transcripts, the tests were designed to improve the accuracy and range of the ship's antiquated 16-inch guns The experiments involved the use of a bagged powder, called <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 846, with 2,700-pound projectiles. That was in violation of warnings written in large letters on each container of D-846 powder bags that said not to use it with the heavier projectiles because it would create too much pressure and heat inside the gun barrel. Apparently to avoid that, the ship's gunners were using five 110-pound bags of the powder instead of the normal six-bag charge. The battleship's commander, Capt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON>, told investigators that he did not know a five-bag charge was going to be used in the No. 2 turret. Master Chief S.P. <PERSON> Skelly </PERSON>, who had won a reputation throughout the service as a ballistics expert, was in charge of the experiments. <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> said <PERSON> Skelly </PERSON> did not brief him on any of the experiments. `` A lot of these things that I'm hearing about, it seems to me they rightfully belong somewhere other than at sea, at least until they're approved through all the shore testing and directed to be conducted at sea,'' <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> said. The investigators pursued the possibility that <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>, who took over as gun captain in a last-minute roster change, perhaps was confused by seeing only five bags of powder delivered at the breech instead of six, and that in the confusion the powder bags were rammed into the barrel too quickly, splitting a bag open and igniting the powder by the heat of friction. The friction theory was eliminated by a series of tests under the direction of the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> at the Naval Surface Warfare Center at <LOCATION> Dahlgren </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, the same command that encouraged the experiments with the D-846 powder aboard the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. But those findings contradicted all previous <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> literature warning of ignition of powder bags by friction. Tests at <PERSON> Dahlgren </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sites found that trace elements present in the breech of the center gun of the No. 2 turret could not be found after firings with normal powder. Those elements were found, however, when a timing device and battery were inserted between the powder bags and the gun was fired. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has suggested that <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> could have inserted a timer into the powder charge. However, the investigation transcripts showed that the breech of the center gun was open at the time of the explosion, and those trace elements could have been blown into the breech by the fireball that swept through the turret.

The creation, which she said was titled `` metal mass,'' was created for her by <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrara </PERSON>. It was topped off with a black helmet with rows of beads falling below her chin. `` At least <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> knows what being a star is all about,'' said <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON> who turned thumbs down on most of the star dressing. `` There's too much cheap glitz,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON>, who compiles an annual worst-dressed list said. `` There's nothing new. No one can figure out what a fashion statement is. This is probably one of the most eclectic masses of yesterday.'' The fans who gathered across the street from the <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION> Civic Auditorium for the ceremonies appeared to share <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON>'s ho hum attitude. They barely screamed at all when the stars stepped from their limousines. In the middle of the fan gallery, protesters from a religious group carried placards reading, `` TV idols and idolaters, repent!'' Perhaps the most unique outfit was worn by a costume designer, <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Glock </PERSON>, who embellished her black minisuit with brass knives, forks and spoons displayed down the front. She called the outfit, `` Dinner For Two.'' In the crowd of fans, some of the warmest applause was reserved for such youth-oriented shows as `` The Wonder Years'' and `` Growing Pains'' as well as the stars of `` Golden Girls,'' a show aimed at an older audience. The `` Golden Girls'' _ <PERSON> Estelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Getty </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bea </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rue </PERSON> <PERSON> McClanahan </PERSON> _ were tastefully glamorous in a range of sequins and satins. <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON> of `` Murder, She Wrote'' showed up in a feminine version of a male tuxedo, an outfit <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON> dubbed as passe. `` I think the pants scene is over,'' he said. `` But I think she looked elegant _ from the hips up.'' The standout, according to <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON>, was <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> who wore a dress with billowing black sleeves and a gold sash. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruttan </PERSON> of `` L.A. Law'' wore a tight brocade minidress fashioned with a net pouf around the neck. Asked who designed her dress, she said, `` I did!'' Said <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON>: `` It looks like it.''

<TEXT>
 Changes in the Soviet bloc are developing so fast it is impossible to tell were they will lead, military specialists from the East and West blocs said at the end Sunday of a three-day conference. Military analysts from <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations were invited for the first time in 20 years to address the annual conference of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> IISS </ORGANIZATION>. `` The general feeling was that the Soviets want reform at least as much as they want order,'' <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Heisbourg </PERSON>, director of the London-based private institute, said in an interview. But continued disorder might spark the violent breakup of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Heisbourg </PERSON> said, citing opinions expressed among those present. The 381 private and government military analysts discussed, among other issues, the consequences of Soviet reform and negotiations between the superpowers. <PERSON> Heisbourg </PERSON> said it was institute policy not to disclose details of the closed-door debate. `` There is currently an atmosphere of detente,'' said <PERSON> Heisbourg </PERSON>, a former defense advisor to the French government. Talks between the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact on conventional arms parity in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> were promising, he said. Opinions ranged from `` very pessimistic to moderately optimistic'' among the specialists from 17 nations on Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s chances for completing his economic and political reforms, he said. The situation shifts so quickly that some authors said their own papers, written two months ago, were already out of date. `` It is in everyone's interest for reforms to succeed,'' <PERSON> Heisbourg </PERSON> said. `` The bottom line is that it will be difficult and take a long time.'' East bloc delegates `` acknowledged grave problems in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'' such as the ethnic strife in provinces wanting a stronger national identity, <PERSON> Heisbourg </PERSON> said. `` Nationalism and populism are symptoms of ailments ... but <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is in charge. There is no coherent opposition to challenge him.'' The independent institute, which was founded in 1958 and has about 3,000 members from 76 countries, studies strategic issues.

 Businesses could help improve the South's infant mortality and low birth rate statistics by educating pregnant employees in prenatal care, Southern governors were told Sunday `` The <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> continues to lag behind the nation'' with an infant mortality rate of 12.0 per 1,000 live births, compared with a national rate of 10.0, according to <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> to Improve Maternal and Child Health. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, plant manager for <ORGANIZATION> Sunbeam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Coushatta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, described his company's mandatory prenatal education program that began in 1986 after statistics for the previous two years showed 11 employees had premature babies that cost the company $ 2 million in medical care. The prenatal education program costs the company $ 10,000 per year, and in 1987, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said there were no premature babies born to employees. In 1988, he said there was one premature baby that was hospitalized for only nine weeks. `` We've saved a great deal of money,'' he said, noting that before the classes, the company was spending about $ 25,000 in health care costs per premature baby. Now the costs per birth are about $ 3,500. Conferees at the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> annual meeting shared ideas on how businesses could help keep babies alive past their first year. The association represents 17 states and two territories. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> said Southern states are reducing infant mortality rates, but low birth weight rates remain high, although figures were not available. Low birth weight babies are those born weighing 5 pounds or less. `` I'll bet you the low birth rate is high because employees do n't have the education I think it's because we have n't reached this employee population like we should,'' he said. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> said he hopes to call a conference in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> late this year or in early 1990 to address the problems with business leaders and health care providers.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ National leader Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> on Sunday promised democratic reforms and economic progress in a speech marking the first anniversary of the coup that put him in power. In the address broadcast on the state-run media from the National Palace, <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> said, `` Our quest is to promote the human, economic, social, and political rights of Haitians.'' He asked the international community to back efforts to return this impoverished <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nation to civilian rule. On Sept. 17, 1988, rank-and-file soldiers outraged by what they called state-sponsored violence ousted former military ruler Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> in a bloodless coup. They chose <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> to head a new government. The soldiers, mostly of the Presidential Guard, also demanded a return to democratic rule and a respect for human rights. Some Haitians are skeptical that <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> will do what he has promised. `` Hope has been reborn in an eventual solution to our problems, even if the relief which Haitians felt at the overthrow of <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> has not developed into confidence in <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Leopold </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlanger </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Haitian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. In March, <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> partially restored the 1987 Constitution that <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> had suspended in July 1988. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> has pledged to turn over power to an elected government and allowed the creation of an independent <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. That council is expected to announce later this month a date for elections. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government granted $ 10 million in surplus wheat to <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> in June. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> resumed direct government aid suspended after aborted elections of 1987, when thugs protected by soldiers killed at least 34 voters at polling stations. Hundreds of allegedly corrupt soldiers and officers have been discharged from the army since <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> took power. On Dec. 14 his government signed five international human-rights conventions. However, human rights groups charge that abuses, often perpetrated by soldiers, are still common. <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> has been govered by military-dominated governments since dictator <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> fled the country during violent demonstrations that ended about three decades of <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> family rule. He now lives in exile in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.

 Graduates of the Bad Check Writer's School probably wo n't be hanging their diplomas on the wall, but authorities hope next time they put pen to paper the results will at least be legal. The school, held at various locations on weekends, is the last step in a pilot program designed to keep misdemeanor offenders from clogging the courts. Those who have written bad checks under $ 200 must reimburse their creditors, pay a $ 65 fine and spend four hours in class learning ethics and how to balance their checkbooks. `` It's dumb mistakes that brings most of us here today,'' student <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Logsdon </PERSON>, 35, said at a recent session. `` I know I've been kicking myself ever since.'' <PERSON> Logsdon </PERSON>, a vitamin salesman from <LOCATION> Glendora </LOCATION>, wrote a bad check to a supermarket for $ 75. `` I thought I had enough money,'' he said. Since 1986, the program has returned $ 1.2 million to merchants. It is expected to double in size next month, said Capt. <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aleks </PERSON>, who heads the program for the district attorney's special operation division. To date, more than 5,000 people have been graduated from the Bad Check Writer's School. To earn their diplomas, the students must know how to balance a bank statement and a checkbook.

 Without moonwalking much or doing new pitching for <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>, pop star <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will make an estimated $ 65 million in 1989 to remain the world's highest-paid entertainer, according to <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> magazine. Aging rock groups who were in their prime 20 years ago banked on reunion tours and a nostalgia wave to join <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>' list of 40 richest entertainers, while some list perennials slipped a bit or dropped off entirely. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made $ 125 million in 1988-89 to edge movie maker <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON>, who made an estimated $ 64 million this year for a two-year total of $ 105 million. Forbes, which is publishing the list in its Oct. 2 issue, said <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> is getting a big boost from the videocassette release last year of his blockbuster film `` E.T. _ The Extraterrestrial.'' Dropping from second to third on the list was <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>, the comedian turned television star and author who amassed some $ 60 million this year and $ 95 million in 1988-89, according to Forbes' calculations <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 31, who gained national attention at age 5 in the Motown family combo The Jackson Five, has made only two albums in the last seven years _ `` Thriller'' in 1982 and `` Bad'' in 1987 _ but reaps millions from sales and endorsements. The androgynous singer announced after ending his `` Bad'' tour in January that he would not perform on stage anymore. <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s last two records have brought in $ 100 million; three videocassettes since 1983 sold over 2 million copies; the Beatles music catalog he bought in 1985 makes him $ 3 million annually; and his autobiography, `` Moonwalk,'' has sold some 425,000 copies. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also has a $ 9 million endorsement deal with <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> _ although he made no new commercials for <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> in 1989 _ and last week signed a deal worth a reported $ 20 million with shoe and sportswear manufacturer L.A.

Each of the top three easily outpaced earnings for the best-paid American corporate executives. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION>, made $ 40 million last year, followed by <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, who had about $ 14.16 million, and <ORGANIZATION> Richard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gelb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bristol-Myers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> with $ 14.14 million, according to <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Whittle Says Channel One Ad Sales Halfway Toward First-Year Goal</HEAD>

 The architects of the Channel One news show for schools say they have signed contracts that put them more than halfway toward their first-year goal of raising $ 90 million from advertising on the program. Some Channel One critics expected the controversy that erupted over a program that enables companies pitch products in the classroom would scare off advertisers. But <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON>, chairman of the <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, Tenn.-based media concern that created Channel One, said in an interview that `` some people have overestimated that issue.'' The daily Channel One television shows are scheduled to begin next March, and <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> has been lining up sponsors for the past three months. Several national education groups and state education officials in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> have vehemently opposed Channel One, and some cable networks have begun offering ad-free alternatives for use in schools, notably a 15-minute daily news show carried on <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> said Friday that advertisers want to buy time on the 12-minute news shows not only because it gives them access to an often hard-to-reach audience of young teens, but to help schools. Revenue from the two minutes of ads on each Channel One show will be used to pay the costs of producing the daily news program, providing two companion educational network services and equipping each participating school with dozens of television sets, a satellite dish and two videocassette recorders. <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> said five companies have signed `` firm, non-cancellable, multiyear contracts'' that will generate $ 51 million in ad revenue during the first year of Channel One programming _ or 56 percent of the first-year goal of $ 90 million. He said those commitments indicate Channel One's revenue will exceed that of any cable TV network during its first year in business. Including the first year's revenue, the contracts would generate $ 149.7 million in ad revenue over the first four years of Channel One, he said. Whittle declined to identify any sponsors, but said they included four who had been in a seven-week test of the Channel One service in six schools last spring as well as one newcomer. None of several of the Channel One test sponsors questioned Friday indicated whether they would advertise on it next spring. <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which advertised two brands of shampoo, potato chips, deodorant and acne medication in the Channel One test, is `` still evaluating the program,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> at the consumer product giant's <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> headquarters. <ORGANIZATION> Levi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strauss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the jeans maker from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, and Wm. Wrigley Jr.. <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the gum maker from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, have made no final decisions, spokesmen said <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiuczynski </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> M </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; M-Mars in <LOCATION> Hackettstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said, `` We do not discuss our future plans'' with the media. The company pitched <ORGANIZATION> M </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ms and Snickers candy during the Channel One test. The Channel One producers are giving advertisers a chance to be the exclusive sponsor in 15 different product categories starting next spring. <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> said the five companies already signed have locked up eight of those product categories. The value of the multiyear contracts, which run either three or four years, ranged from $ 13 million to $ 53 million, he said. Whittle took several steps this summer to indicate that it is making progress toward getting Channel One in operation. It signed a $ 150 million contract with <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, to make, install and maintain the video system in the schools. It named a panel of 12 luminaries led by former Education Secretary <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> to advise the Channel One programmers. Earlier this month, <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> began an intensive effort toward signing up schools for the program. Whittle declined to say how many schools have signed up, but said he is confident that the targets of 1,000 schools at launch and 8,000 by December 1990 will be reached.

<HEAD>Children's Products Market Takes Off With Baby Boom</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The convention hall may be full of playpens and cribs, pacifiers and cradles, but there is little child's play at the 20th annual <ORGANIZATION> Juvenile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> trade show _ where companies come for show-and-tell in the $ 1.95 billion market in wares for the under-3 gang. There are even products that help combat yuppie guilt for being at work instead of at home with the kids. Now that baby boomers are having babies themselves the market has taken off, spurred by the higher salaries of professional, two-career families who wait until later in life to have children. Also, fewer children per family means more money per child, association members said. Tastes also have changed, with price often being of little object, said <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepys </PERSON>, the trade group's vice president and head of her own firm, which makes coordinated nursery bedding and other infant products. For example, her <ORGANIZATION> Noel-Joanna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which markets products under the NoJo brand, last year introduced a <LOCATION> Battenberg </LOCATION> lace crib ensemble, complete with elegant canopy. The price: about $ 600. `` We just did it for fun,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Pepys </PERSON> said. `` It's turned into one of our best sellers.'' Such extravagance does n't last long. `` While they'll spend $ 600 on the crib bedding, which they'll use for two years, they balk at spending $ 100 for a comforter for a bunk bed. At -LRB- age -RRB- 2, practicality takes over.'' Before then, however, parents will shell out the bucks. <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Blakey </PERSON>, the association's director of public relations, said studies indicate parents spend $ 30,000 on a child up until age 5, about 30 percent of all they'll spend before the child reaches 18. And there are so many ways to spend it. <ORGANIZATION> Playskool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a wholly owned subsidiary of toymaker <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, has a three-sided toothbrush among its abundance of infant care products _ many adorned with <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kermit </PERSON> the Frog _ to pitch during the show this weekend at the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apparel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mart </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Playskool </PERSON> is one of the large players in the industry, manufacturing about six pieces of product for every birth in the country last year, said President <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Stebenne </PERSON>. But Mrs. <PERSON> Pepys </PERSON> said only about 20 of the 250 or so companies at the show have annual sales of $ 20 million or more. Most of the firms would be considered small businesses, she said. Many of the companies were begun by parents who developed a product to meet their own needs, and then recognized a wider potential, Mrs. <PERSON> Pepys </PERSON> said. One such firm is Decorate It! <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, whose president, <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, said the company's wall decorating product was created `` out of pure need,'' specifically to avoid lengthy redecorating of yet another room.'' The system consists of a border and appliques with an adhesive that allows them to be pulled off and reapplied `` more frequently that anyone would every want to do it,'' said <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who is also a vice president of athletic shoemaker <ORGANIZATION> Reebok </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>. Also, joked <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, kids and parents can do the redecorating together, `` a way to alleviate yuppie guilt'' over not spending enough time with the children Safety also has become a big issue in the industry. Cribs, for example, no longer have finial posts or other sharp edges but are an array of curves and rounded edges to prevent accidental cuts. Even bedding has been affected, Mrs. <PERSON> Pepys </PERSON> said, noting that manufacturers have to be aware of the length of ties on crib bumper pads to prevent accidental strangulation. The association has begun a certification program and hopes to make consumers more aware of which products have been given a <ORGANIZATION> JPMA </ORGANIZATION> seal of approval.

<HEAD>Report: Japan, U.S. Planning Joint Work on New Computer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have agreed to start joint development of applications for the so-called fifth-generation computer, a Japanese newspaper reported Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> said the cooperation will begin with the exhibition of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Multi-Personal Sequential Inference -LRB- PSI -RRB- system at a Japan-U.S. symposium on artificial intelligence scheduled for Oct. 11-13 in <LOCATION> Argonne </LOCATION>, Ill. The new system, a prototype fifth-generation, or artificial intelligence, computer built in November 1988, is the only one of its kind, said <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest circulation newspaper. The move is aimed at reducing friction between the two countries over advanced technology, it said, quoting unidentified sources at the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>. At the symposium at the <ORGANIZATION> Argonne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, the two governments would begin using the new Japanese system in specific research tasks under a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> research program, it said. Government officials could not be reached for comment Sunday. After the vacuum-tube computer, the transistorized computer and the integrated circuit computer, the fourth generation computer includes supercomputers with very large-scale integration circuits. The immense calculating power of supercomputers is used for such tasks as helping meteorologists to predict weather, oilmen to draw up intricate geological maps and chemists to test molecular combinations in the search for new drugs. The fifth generation of computer, with very, very large-scale integration circuits, is envisioned as comprehending the spoken and written word, perfecting language-translation systems, and extending databases to `` knowledge bases,'' a more complex system endowing computers with common-sense attributes. In fifth-generation computer science, <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> said, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is considered `` far ahead'' of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and others in hardware. All are developing this science under government projects. Leading the research in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, a think tank of more than 70 researchers established in 1982 under <ORGANIZATION> MITI </ORGANIZATION>'s guidance. The equivalent of more than $ 1 billion in Japanese government and corporate funds is going into the effort. <ORGANIZATION> MITI </ORGANIZATION> decided to let <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> jointly sponsor the exhibition of the <ORGANIZATION> PSI </ORGANIZATION> system after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> scientists expressed interest in using the computer in genetic engineering, <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> researchers, said to be ahead of their Japanese counterparts in genetic engineering, are interested in using the <ORGANIZATION> PSI </ORGANIZATION> computer because of its superior inferential ability, it said. <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> quoted anonymous <ORGANIZATION> MITI </ORGANIZATION> officials as saying Japanese scientists also could learn new genetic engineering techniques in the joint project.

<HEAD>Workers Overwhelmingly Approve Three-Year Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FENTON, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Union employees at a <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> assembly plant voted overwhelmingly to approve a three-year contract that was reached hours before a strike deadline earlier in the week. A union spokesman said Saturday's vote was more than 90 percent in favor of the three-year agreement, which affects about 3,800 of the 4,400 workers at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s No. 1 plant in suburban <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. The union said a major gain in the agreement is a provision for relief for plant workers during heat waves. Complaints about what workers called `` unbearable'' heat inside the plant prompted wildcat walkouts in the past. Economic issues, such as wages and fringe benefits, are covered in the national contract that expires in September 1990. Although details of the contract were not released, Local 136 President <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON> said it contained provisions for more heat breaks and more ice and water when heat becomes a problem inside the plant. The plant manufactures <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daytona </ORGANIZATION> sports cars and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> LeBaron sports coupes and convertibles.
