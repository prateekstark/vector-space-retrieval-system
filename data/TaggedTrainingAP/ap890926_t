 Senator negotiators agreed Tuesday to boost the war on drugs to $ 9.4 billion, capping a week of talks with the White House and lifting a Republican blockade that stalled action on four money bills. `` It seems that everything is worked out so we have an agreed-upon package,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, the chief <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> As part of their deal, <ORGANIZATION> Republicans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> agreed that later this year, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would consider elements of a crime-fighting package unveiled by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in June but dormant since then. With the agreement in hand, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed two of four appropriations bills that had been stalled by Republicans for more than a week in a move to gain leverage in bargaining over the drug package. Within an hour the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed a $ 14.4 billion foreign aid measure and a $ 157.4 billion bill for labor, health and education programs. The White House indicated its approval of the agreement earlier in the day before it was cemented. Presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the outlines of the plan appeared `` consistent with our objectives.'' `` We do expect to accept this arrangement and hopefully we can get on with implementing the drug plan,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The negotiations began early last week after Democrats proposed to add $ 2.2 billion to the $ 7.9 billion proposed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in his Sept. 5 address to the nation on the scourge of drugs. They said that education, treatment and prevention programs were underfunded in the administration's battle plan for fighting the drug war. The freshly minted package funds the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's initial $ 7.9 billion war on drugs plus $ 400 million in other crime-fighting money requested by the president in June as well as $ 200 million for juvenile justice programs and the $ 900 million boost that had been the center of week-long negotiations The $ 900 million would provide $ 100 million for law enforcement and the rest for prevention, education and treatment, the `` demand side'' of the drug war that Democrats say was underfunded in the president's original plan. `` Without building up the demand side, then we're really caught fighting the drug war with one hand behind us,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. Actually, the $ 200 million for juvenile justice already was contained in a bill to provide money for the State, <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Departments </ORGANIZATION>. Moving them into the drug package, raised the total added by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to $ 1.1 billion, exactly half the amount that <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> initially had sought. The increase would be funded through reductions in other spending programs that would be 0.43 percent if applied across-the-board. Under the plan, however, appropriations subcommittees would be able to pick and choose among programs, allowing some to escape the full brunt of the cuts. Many elements of the president's crime-fighting package are contained in the drug strategy, but some highly controversial elements are missing and the administration has been pushing for action on them. They include applying the death penalty to a wider range of crimes than under current law. Another key provision would place limits on the number of appeals that could be filed by certain prisoners, and a third would ease restrictions on how police and prosecutors obtain certain kinds of evidence.

 Handicapped protesters who occupied a federal building for two days won a pledge of government support Tuesday, but failed to win an order requiring wheelchair lifts on all new public buses bought with federal funds. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> `` can not issue a summary order commanding immediate access including wheelchair access for all transit,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, chief counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, who met with the protest leaders. `` We would if we could.'' But <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said DOT officials and the protesters had agreed on three points: _ <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> will be urged to meet promptly with disabled activists to ensure a `` principle of accessibility'' until <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passes the Americans with Disabilities Act _ The protesters will be allowed to continue a `` symbolic presence'' at the <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> building in downtown <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> _ Officials will relay to <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> the protesters' concern that new rules for handicapped accessibility to air travel are not being drafted quickly enough `` This agreement by no means resolves the problem of access; it just brings us a step closer,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> Alpharetta </LOCATION>, one of the protest leaders who met with <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> and other DOT officials. He said he did n't know if the protesters would leave the building, where they blocked elevators and entrance doors earlier Tuesday. But by late Tuesday, it appeared the protesters had left; none were visible inside the building. `` We may stay here through Thursday, or we may just leave a sticker on the wall. There could be a constant vigil at the building, or we could all leave,'' he said earlier. The protest by members of ADAPT, or American Disabled for <ORGANIZATION> Accessible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, began Monday when <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to address the convention of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. At least two dozen protesters chained themselves to doors or blocked exits with their wheelchairs Monday. Authorities attempted to eject several protesters from the building Monday evening, but President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> intervened and let them spend the night inside rather than send them out into the rain. On Tuesday, the protesters made good on a threat to block entrances to the building's main level at noon if their demands were not met by then. About two hours later, while federal officials met with protest leaders outside the building, about 160 chanting, singing activists kept federal employees and visitors from using 12 of the 14 main-floor elevators by blocking them with wheelchairs. Security officers were able to keep two elevators open by using plant stands to keep wheelchairs away from them. About 100 protesters spent Monday night in the building, eating take-out food and sleeping under blankets provided by attendants. Early Tuesday, a group of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> bartenders brought them coffee and doughnuts. `` It was an uncomfortable night,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, 39, of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. But he added: `` The misery that we're going through is worth it if we get what we want. All we are asking for is a lift on every bus so that we can be more independent. We're not asking for a million dollars.'' But government officials have estimated that putting wheelchair lifts on all new public buses would cost $ 90 million a year. ADAPT also has been trying to force the installation of lifts on all new buses through the courts. In <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, a federal appeals court panel backed their lawsuit, saying federal law requires lifts on new buses. But in July, the full 3rd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> overturned that ruling, saying government officials did not have to put lifts on all buses if they thought some other method of serving the handicapped would be better. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>, an attorney for ADAPT, said the group was waiting to see what <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did on the bus issue before deciding whether to appeal.

 A <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> teen-ager was arrested Tuesday on charges of selling the crack cocaine that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> displayed on television to illustrate the seriousness of the nation's drug problems. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 18, was indicted earlier in the day by a federal grand jury on four counts of unlawfully distributing crack and one count of using a telephone to help arrange an alleged sale. The alleged distribution started in April, on one occasion near <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in July, according to the indictment. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was picked up at his home in southeast <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by city police and <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agents, said <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Cornelius </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Pattrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Attridge </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> held without bond pending another hearing Wednesday. In a Sept. 5 televised speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> held up a clear plastic bag containing a handful of crack nuggets and said they had been seized across the street from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> a few days previously. The alleged dealer was lured to <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> _ not one of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s drug markets _ four days before by undercover drug agents after <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> staffers asked for a sample from the vicinity of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to show that dealing could happen anywhere. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> said they had planned to make the purchase a few blocks away before the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> request. The transaction with an undercover <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agent was photographed, but the dealer was not taken into custody then because agents hoped he would sell a larger amount later and identify his supply organization, officials said. A planned arrest last week fell through when the suspect did not show up.

 Gunmen believed to be communist rebels ambushed and killed two American civilians working at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military base Tuesday, shortly before Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> arrived to discuss the future of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military installations in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> condemmed the killings as `` cowardly murders'' and said the slayings will `` only serve to strengthen'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. Meeting with Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> later, he proposed that talks begin in December on extending <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases in the country. Police arrested at least 15 people on Wednesday for joining rallies protesting <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s visit. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials banned non-essential travel between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases by the 40,000 American troops, civilian employees and military dependents in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. There is growing opposition among Filipinos to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases. Following his hour-long meeting with Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters he delivered a letter from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> suggesting the talks on the future of the six bases, whose lease expires in September 1991. The ambush victims were employees of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which contracts to maintain an electronic warfare training range at Camp O'Donnell. The camp is a U.S.-run facility about 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and 12 miles from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Clark Air Base. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> identified the victims as <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, 45, and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchner </PERSON>, 44. He said both were retired from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. Their hometowns were not available. The Americans slowed their car as they approached a dump truck and a jeep blocking a highway near <LOCATION> Capas </LOCATION>, 60 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, police said. Six men jumped out of the jeep and riddled their car with gunfire, according to police Lt. <PERSON> Pepito </PERSON> <PERSON> Pimentel </PERSON>. The assailants then opened the car door and pumped bullets into the victims, <PERSON> Pimentel </PERSON> said. The attack occurred about 5 p.m. `` We deplore this senseless and cowardly act of terrorism,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` Acts like this will not deter us in our resolve to support the democratic government in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>.'' Col. <PERSON> Florentino </PERSON> <PERSON> Amorabon </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION> in central <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> island, said the assassins were believed to be members of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which operates in the area. In April, rebels killed <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> as he was driving to the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Quezon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. In October 1987, rebels killed three Americans in simultaneous attacks outside Clark Air Base. Also Tuesday, gunmen killed a member of Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s presidential guard, about a mile from where the president met with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on Wednesday The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> operates <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> naval base and four smaller installations in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, but there are increased calls for an end to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has offered new talks on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases but refuses to say whether she will support an extension. Any new agreement must be ratified by two-thirds of the 23-member Philippine <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where opposition to the bases is strong. In a statement released Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> called <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s visit `` part of the intensifying pressure by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on the Aquino regime'' to extend the bases. `` This pressure covers all aspects, economic, political and military,'' the rebels said. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is overextending legal means and is using dirty and underhanded tactics to achieve its ends.'' As <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> arrived from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Tuesday evening, hundreds of leftists burned his effigy and an American flag while chanting `` Bases out!, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> go home!'' In a speech Wednesday to a business group, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> deplored the killings of the two Americans. `` It should go without saying that these cowardly murders deserve the strong condemnation of all civilized men and women,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` The people of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, like the the people of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, are sickened by the acts of vicious terrorists who wish to drown freedom in the blood of innocent men and women.'' Two hours before <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s arrival, about 150 members of the League of Filipino Students and the Youth for Nationalism and Democracy reached the airport terminal and began a noisy demonstration against the visit. After negotiations with police, the group agreed to pull back about a half mile away. Police estimated the crowd grew to nearly 1,000 by the time <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> arrived. Earlier, nine policemen were injured and nine students arrested when security forces broke up a rally at <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Adamson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, officials said. Also Tuesday, suspected rebels killed Capt. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Daileg </PERSON>, a staff officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, in an ambush in the city's <LOCATION> Pandacan </LOCATION> district. Police and troops have been on alert in the capital following bombings in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> that have killed two people and injured 16 since Sept. 16.

 With thousands of East Germans going <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in the past few months, those staying behind have found themselves without the services of some important people _ from the village baker, to the town plumber, to medical specialists. There are visible signs of the `` people drain'' in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. An official sign on a shuttered bar called `` Restoration 1900'' says the establishment has received `` permission to close'' because the manager is ill. Local residents say that in truth, the manager fled to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> two months ago `` An operator of three other bars in this area also went West a while back. He's since been replaced,'' said a middle-age East German walking past the bar on the city's Husemannstrasse. A vegetable shop a few blocks away is shuttered as well, and residents say its owner also has gone to the West. East German reform activist <PERSON> Jens </PERSON> <PERSON> Reich </PERSON> says his eye doctor has fled to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` I fear my dentist's gone as well,'' said <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> founder of the fledgling New Forum pro-democracy group. About 100,000 East Germans have either fled or emigrated legally to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> this year, the greatest flood of East German refugees since the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall went up in 1961. More than 17,500 of them have gone through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> since that country opened its Western border to East Germans Sept. 10. The refugees say they left their homeland because they could no longer bear the lack of democratic freedoms and because they want better lives in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. The exodus has produced a new rash of demands for political and economic reform among many East Germans who remain behind. Within two weeks of the exodus, <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>'s group collected signatures of more than 2,000 citizens supporting its pro-democracy demands. Church officials in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have intensified their calls for democratic change as well. They say leaving the country is no way to change it. `` Someone who is in <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> can not be of service to a patient at the Catholic hospital in <LOCATION> Erfurt </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' East German Roman Catholic Bishop <PERSON> Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wanke </PERSON> has said. Sources within the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the drain of medical personnel is so severe in the district of <LOCATION> Suhl </LOCATION> that doctors there have been forbidden to travel out of the country. Officials have not released any figures on how the exodus has affected medical care or any other professions or businesses. The West German Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper said Sept. 18 it was told by church officials a number of hospitals have had to replace employees ranging from student nurses to chief physicians. The refugees who have fled West in the past few months are mostly young people who left behind good jobs, and in many cases promising careers. According to a study released Sept. 12 by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Ministry for Inner-German Relations, the refugees worked in industry, medicine and other service-sector areas, crafts, administration and education <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has a population of 16.6 million. No one has said the refugee exodus means economic disaster, but the Communist leadership has acknowledged it is causing problems. Residents across the country have reported that some department stores are operating with drastically reduced staffs, many gas stations are shortening their work days, and other establishments are closing down completely. The <PERSON> Frankfurter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rundschau </PERSON> said that at times, cynical humor takes over when those left behind talk about employees who have gone West. `` A hairdresser in <LOCATION> Erfurt </LOCATION> coolly tells a customer: ` So, you want to make an appointment with <PERSON> Bettina </PERSON>? Then you'd better call <LOCATION> Passau </LOCATION> or make a complaint to -LRB- West German Chancellor -RRB- <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>,''' said <PERSON> Rundschau </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The city leaped at a chance to put its `` Frog Crossing'' signs back up, and the mayor even thinks he's figured out a way to keep souvenir hunters from slipping away with them `` I am going to have a T-shirt made of the frog-crossing sign,'' Mayor <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> said after the signs were re-posted last week. `` Maybe if we get people to buy T-shirts, they wo n't steal the sign.'' The two signs have been missing since shortly after they were erected in July 1987 on a stretch of road through the <LOCATION> Schmeeckle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reserve </LOCATION>. Suspicious minds linked the signs' disappearance with the return of students that year to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin-Stevens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point </ORGANIZATION>. The signs were posted along two ramps that were cut in the curb to help frogs and other small animals cross the road. A city worker came up with the design, featuring four frogs in various stages of leaping. Recently, one of the original signs was recovered and repaired, and officials decided to give it another try. `` The general reaction is that folks are glad the sign is back up,'' <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> said. `` The real purpose was to highlight that there is a nature preserve.'' When the first signs disappeared so quickly, official decided it would be pointless to keep putting them up in a battle with souvenir-hunters. This time, T-shirts are n't the only deterrent to theft, <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> said: `` They welded the bolts this time.''

<TEXT>
 A million refugees have flooded back into <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> after six months of fighting, many impoverished by their ordeal and some fearful lest the savage shelling flares up again. Long lines of cars began streaming into the shattered capital within minutes of the announcement Friday by <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> leader Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> that he was accepting an Arab League cease-fire. Hundreds more Lebanese booked passage for the three-hour ferry crossing from <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> to the Christian port of <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION>, while others flew into the newly reopened <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport. The six months of fighting killed at least 929 people and wounded 2,741. <PERSON> Issam </PERSON> <PERSON> Baydoun </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem bank employee who fled during the shelling battles that pitted <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s mainly Christian fighters against <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and its Moslem militia allies, was among the returnees. `` I have spent most of my 30 years' savings during the 2 -LCB- months of forced migration to the south,'' said the 55-year-old father of two. <PERSON> Baydoun </PERSON> said he fled his <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> home in a seven-story apartment building in the heavily shelled district of <PERSON> Ras </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Nabeh </PERSON> in July, when `` things could not be borne anymore.'' `` My wife had started taking sedatives,'' he said. `` My daughter screamed every time a shell crashed nearby or because of the sound of a rocket passing overhead.'' Just like many other west Beirutis, <PERSON> Baydoun </PERSON> headed south. He rented a two-room house for $ 900 a month in <LOCATION> Iqlim </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kharroub </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Chouf </LOCATION> mountains. `` In all, I spent $ 3,000 in only 75 days of exile,'' he said. `` Believe me, now that we're back I ca n't afford to restore my shell-pocked house.'' Asked whether he would be able to rent another house in the south if fighting broke out again, <PERSON> Baydoun </PERSON> said: `` I am a conscientious employee and have a good reputation at the bank. The bank manager might be willing to lend me some money on temporary basis. But to tell you the truth, God knows when I will be able to pay him back.'' He was glad to be back, albeit impoverished, saying `` there's no place like home.'' The Baydouns' neighborhood is in a section of west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> where <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and its allies installed their advance artillery batteries. On the opposite side are <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s troops as well as Christian militants from the Lebanese Forces. East Beirut residents also breathed relief when the Arab league commitee announced the opening of all crossings linking both sectors of the capital, the lifting of the 6-month-old blockade of the Christian heartland and the opening of the airport. `` May God guide them to the right path,'' said <PERSON> Samira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gobril </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> housewife who expressed hope that the leaders of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s factions would work together for a durable peace. `` May God keep utmost in their minds the plight of the poor population.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gobril </PERSON>, 38, and mother of an 11-year-old boy and an 8-year-old girl, lives in the frequently battered Christian area of <LOCATION> Ashrafieh </LOCATION> a few miles from the Green Line that divides east from west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. She had fled to the fashionable mountain resort of <LOCATION> Faraya </LOCATION>, 20 miles to the northeast. `` This time we could afford it,'' she added, but `` it'll take my husband five years of hard work to recoup the amount of money we have spent during the last four months.'' Police said at least 1 million refugees who fled <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> have returned since Friday. <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> took the brunt of the shelling, forcing all but 150,000 of its remaining 1.5 million people to flee. Some of those that did not travel to safer areas of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> took the ferry to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, either to wait out the fighting or to apply for American, Canadian, Australian and other visas as a gateway to a new life away from their country, shattered by 14 years of civil war. Estimates vary. Immigration officials in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> say about 20,000 Lebanese are on the small east <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island whose population numbers just 691,000. But relief agency officials working to ease the refugees' plight said the actual number of Lebanese in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> probably reached 30,000 at the height of the fighting and perhaps more. The Christian refugees' only exit to the outside world has been through a hydrofoil ferry service from the port of <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> on the south <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> coast. Moslems, too, have been fleeing to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, though they are still a minority of the Lebanese refugees on the island.

 <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Liubakka </PERSON> is a newcomer to politics, but he figures he's bound to get a hefty vote in next year's gubernatorial race That's because he's running as founder of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apathetic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. With a 60 percent voter turnout expected in the 1990 election, <LOCATION> Liubakka </LOCATION> can claim the other 40 percent of the electorate as constituents. `` They wo n't vote, and a ` no' vote is a vote for me,'' the 36-year-old contractor said recently. The unofficial party _ it's known as <ORGANIZATION> NAP </ORGANIZATION> _ even has a mascot: a battered eagle. The bird's neck is longer than most eagles' because it's been stretched a few times. Its left wing is clipped from giving away so many handouts. Its tail feathers are lost. On the rare occasions <PERSON> Liubakka </PERSON> removes his tongue from his cheek, he'll betray serious worries about the state of the body politic. `` Our intention is to slap everybody in the face with ignorance,'' the unregistered candidate said, `` and hopefully this blunt hint will get them out to vote more.''

 The northern third of the country will have more snow than usual but it'll be a mild winter for most of the country, says no less an authority than the Old Farmer's Almanac. <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> <PERSON> Weatherwise </PERSON>, who claims 80 percent accuracy in `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s oldest continuously published periodical,'' predicts a white Christmas in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> The 198th edition of the 224-page almanac hits the newsstands and supermarkets this week with its familiar planting and tide tables, anecdotes and other tidbits, such as 100 ways how to avoid untimely death. -LRB- No. 49, avoid combing hair in the dark; No. 77, never whistle in a coal mine. -RRB- <PERSON> Abe </PERSON>, a collective pseudonym, says the almanac's predictions are `` based on state-of-the art analysis of recurring solar cycles.'' He predicts that a cold, wet and snowy spring in the North will be balanced by warm, dry spring weather west of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. The summer of 1990, says <PERSON> Abe </PERSON>, will be hot and dry in many areas east of the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION>. In addition to weather predictions, the almanac has advertisements for hernia appliances, secrets of winning lotteries and rules of thumb for rhubarb pie. It also advises that cows and pigs bred for leanness will boost the popularity of red meat and inflation will run at 6 percent. Among other predictions: the return of the 4-inch-wide necktie for men, short hair for women and lower prices for videocassette recorders.

 Most everyone has heard of killer bees and killer whales _ but what about killer snails? One man is determined to prove that the combative cousins of common garden snails are the answer to eliminating the slow-moving but voracious plant munchers. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrie </PERSON>, 34, sells a hostile snail breed that he claims will prey on the garden pests. `` It's the tough new snail on the block,'' <PERSON> Harrie </PERSON> said the other day from his demonstration booth at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fair </LOCATION>. The shell-less critters ambush garden snails, following their slime trails and attacking them when they lay their eggs, <PERSON> Harrie </PERSON> said. The bloodthirsty snails, known to scientists as Rumina decollata, usually leave their victims mortally wounded, rather than killing them outright, he said. <PERSON> Harrie </PERSON>, who sells the attack snails for $ 20 per 100, claims they're too slow-moving to move from the garden to the house, and pose no danger to children and pets.

 A bomb exploded Monday night in the <ORGANIZATION> Cartagena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> on the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and reports said two doctors were killed and another was wounded, the chief of the police in that coastal resort said. Another bomb exploded at a <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION> bank Monday night, injuring a passer-by, Col. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview. A fireman at the hotel told a Colombian TV news crew the blast ripped through the sixth floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Cartagena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION>, whose majority owner is the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The bomb exploded in room 642, the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> radio chain <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION> said in a report from the scene. The two doctors who were killed were attending a medical convention at the hotel, <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION> said. Their identities were not immediately available. The one who was injured was also thought to be Colombian, witnesses told <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> said no one had claimed responsibility for the bombs. However, Colombian government security forces have presumed that scores of bombs that have exploded in major <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> cities in the last month have been the work of drug traffickers who declared war on the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government. Including the two bombs in <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION> and one Monday night in the capital of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, there have been 110 bombings, killing eight persons and injuring 132 persons. The Hilton was evacuating the approximately 1,500 guests to other hotels in <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION> said, quoting its correspondent, who filed a report by radio telephone with <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. Thousands of Americans, Canadians and other foreigners flock to <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION> each year. A group of Canadian tourists at the <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION> airport last week told the wife of an AP reporter they were cutting their vacations short and going home because the <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> warned them of the war possibly spreading to <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION>. Police told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> the third bomb was at a billing office of the government electric company in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, but that no one was reported injured. It was the first time bombs hit <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION> since drug traffickers declared war on the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government last month. A leading presidential candidate was quoted earlier Monday as saying <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> may have to legalize drugs in order to fight the powerful cartels waging war on the government. Also Monday, two politicians said the government should negotiate with drug lords. Representatives of the nation's 4,600 judges were to meet with the acting justice minister, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemos </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmonds </PERSON>. The judges threatened Sunday to go on strike unless <PERSON> Simmonds </PERSON> promised them better protection from drug cartels, who persistently threaten their lives. Since 1981, about 50 judges and 170 judicial employees have been killed, mostly by drug traffickers. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials sent 100 bulletproof vests and other security items to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> last week to help protect judges. He said it was the responsibility of <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> officials to distribute the items. Four bombs exploded Sunday night in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, but there were no injuries, national police said. Sen. <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Samper </PERSON>, seeking the government <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s nomination for the presidential election in March, said of the drug war: `` If the repressive action fails, the road left is legalization of drugs. <PERSON> Samper </PERSON> made the comment in an interview published Monday by the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republica </ORGANIZATION>. He is the first serious presidential candidate to suggest legalizing drugs. The government began its crackdown on the drug cartels when leading presidential candidate <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON> was assassinated Aug. 18 at a <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> political rally. President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>, who by law can not run for re-election, said he would extradite drug lords to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, prompting the cartels to declare war on the government. There have been reports the traffickers are willing to pay billions of dollars to get the government to end its crackdown, but <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> has refused to negotiate. The mayor of the city of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, said Monday that `` after this war is over and there are many dead ... we are going to end up at the negotiating table talking with the drug traffickers.'' `` The dialogue would be Christian because it would avoid many deaths,'' the mayor said in an interview with <PERSON> Caracol </PERSON>. Also coming out Monday in favor of negotiations was the president of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, or lower chamber of parliament, <PERSON> Norberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>. `` We have to open the way toward this initiative because we are bleeding to death -LRB- and -RRB- our economy is in ruins,'' <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION>. On Saturday, <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> said two of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s major drug trafficking suspects had called him with an offer to negotiate with the government. He said he passed the information along to <LOCATION> Barco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> offered to invest millions of dollars from their cocaine profits in Colombian industry if a truce is reached, <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> said. Government officials have said in the past that drug traffickers apparently invest the bulk of their money outside <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> are on the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s list of most wanted drug-trafficking suspects. They are the strongest members of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel, which is said to supply 80 percent of the cocaine reaching the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The traffickers have made earlier offers. Recently, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> narcotics official with the embassy in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> said in an interview that the traffickers want pardons so they can emerge from years of hiding. In return, the official said, the traffickers apparently offered to move their operations to other countries, possibly <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. Also, he said, the traffickers suggested they would finance much of the government's 30-year-old war against leftist guerrillas. The biggest offer from the traffickers came in 1984, when the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel offered to pay off <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s foreign debt, then about $ 10 billion, in exchange for amnesty. The government refused.

 Commuters struggled through rush hour with no traffic lights in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> and power companies rebuilt electric systems Monday, four days after Hurricane Hugo's remnants struck. Also on Monday, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared four inland <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> counties disaster areas eligible for federal assistance. `` The damage has been extensive, and the progress has been slower than expected,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Maher </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>. He said it would be a week or two before full service is restored. About 280,000 Duke customers in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> were still without electricity, including <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, the utility's board chairman. `` I feel like I'm in good company,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. Preliminary damage estimates for hard-hit <LOCATION> Mecklenburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> rose to $ 336 million, but officials said the damage is so extensive it is still difficult to gauge. <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Shook </PERSON>, assistant manager of <LOCATION> Mecklenburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, estimated that 120,000 county residents, mostly in rural areas, remained without water Monday. County agencies, meanwhile, had 250 reports of price gouging. In <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, rural residents who were without water because of the power outages took showers at a high school. Drinking water was distributed from four locations around the county. `` I'm out of power at home myself,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, the county's emergency management coordinator. `` But I have a daughter close by with power, so I can get a shower and she wo n't let me go hungry.'' Two power company workers in <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> were injured Monday when a power line came loose and hit them. One worker was in critical condition and the other was in stable condition, hospital officials said. The loss of electricity made traffic signals useless as <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> workers began their work week. A National Guardsman and a <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> police officer directing traffic at a busy intersection were hospitalized after being struck by a car during the morning rush hour. The police officer was treated for a broken leg, while the guardsman, a member of a military police company from <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, was listed in stable condition with cuts to his face and thigh. About 550 National Guardsmen are on duty in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. More than 200 <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> workers, including 56 chain saw crews, were deployed in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morganton </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, the only coastal county to sustain major damage from Hugo, heavy rain slowed cleanup efforts. `` The rain is hampering us for certain,'' said <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Logan </PERSON>, county emergency management coordinator. `` It will delay our major cleanup efforts for at least a day.'' Beach homes were left hanging over the surf all along the county's coastline, with the dune line virtually wiped out in many areas.

 The Metropolitan Opera chose `` Aida'' as its opening night opera and gave it a dream cast. <PERSON> Aprile </PERSON> <PERSON> Millo </PERSON>, heralded as the next great <PERSON> Verdi </PERSON> soprano, sang the title role on Monday night. Not content just to pour out her voice of grandeur, she used shading, held notes and pianissimo and acted the slave to <LOCATION> Amneris </LOCATION> that Aida is. Seldom has a Met Opera Aida been so often on her knees. <PERSON> Placido </PERSON> <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON>, the Radames when this production was new last December, sang Radames again. His voice was beautiful in tone, smooth in production, sometimes ringing, occasionally tense and harder-edged than it formerly was. He does n't scoop up to high notes, as most tenors do, in `` Celeste Aida.'' The final love duet, when both inserted tenderness into their generous-size voices, was thrilling. <PERSON> Dolora </PERSON> <PERSON> Zajick </PERSON>, who made her Met debut last fall, sang a notable Amneris. She's a mezzo soprano but has a delivery like a soprano and a confident stage presence. Some Amnerises are almost unnoticed. When the two were together, this Amneris commanded more attention than Aida. As <PERSON> Aida </PERSON> was subservient, the king's daughter <PERSON> Amneris </PERSON> was regal. Miss <PERSON> Zajick </PERSON>'s voice also conveyed <PERSON> Amneris </PERSON>' love, making her a sympathetic character. <PERSON> Paata </PERSON> <PERSON> Burchuladze </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION>, was making his Met debut as the high priest. <PERSON> Burchuladze </PERSON>, a winner in the 1985 <PERSON> Luciano </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON> voice competition in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, has the deep notes and dark sound Americans expect and adore from Russian basses. He has sung `` <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Godunov </PERSON>'' in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sherrill </PERSON> <PERSON> Milnes </PERSON> sang <PERSON> Aida </PERSON>'s father with urgency _ he's concerned with the Egypt-Ethiopia war, not with love. <PERSON> Milnes </PERSON> also sang with a beautiful tone, which characterized all the principals. The triumphal entry scene included a couple of horses and, for once in a Met production, no eccentricity. Three young dancers in Act 2 were pleasing. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> conducted with understanding. The production, by <PERSON> Sonja </PERSON> <PERSON> Frisell </PERSON>, twice uses the device of moving a set by elevator, thereby revealing the next set either above or below it. This is dramatic and effective. The first time it was done, going from <PERSON> Amneris </PERSON>' rooms to a public square full of Egyptians, the audience gasped with appreciation. Though some were well gowned, women in the opening night audience provided less a fashion show than in some years.

 `` Black Rain,'' the thriller starring <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> as a cop who tracks a killer through the streets of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, captured first place in box office revenues last weekend. The Paramount movie grossed $ 9.7 million in its first three days of release. Universal's `` Sea of Love,'' the romantic suspense tale featuring <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Pacino </PERSON> in his first film since the 1985 bomb `` Revolution,'' collected $ 7.8 million to land in second place. Universal also claimed the Nos. 3 and 4 spots. `` Uncle Buck,'' the comedy starring <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Candy </PERSON> as an overbearing relative on a family baby-sitting assignment, finished in third on receipts of $ 3.2 million. Director <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>'s `` Parenthood,'' with <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> heading an ensemble comedy cast, was fourth with sales of $ 3 million.

 Investigators hope <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s next scheduled space mission wo n't be delayed by damage caused by a surge of fire protection water that sprayed the shuttle. `` I have not given up launching on the 18th,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Utsman </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> who heads the investigation into Sunday's accident. <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> is scheduled for liftoff on Dec. 18. <PERSON> Utsman </PERSON> said Monday the problem started when a valve failed, and then two workers in their haste to shut off the system mistakenly turned on most of the sprinklers. `` I'm chalking it up to a combination of equipment error and human error,'' he said. `` The guys who did it were only trying to help. ... Good intentions sometimes go wrong.'' As many as 200 of the shuttle's 500 woven fiberglass heat shields may have to be replaced, he said. The blankets, about the size of a beach towel, protect the top of the shuttle `` The thermal blankets are our major concern,'' <PERSON> Utsman </PERSON> said. He said initial inspection revealed no damage to any of the more than 20,000 silica thermal tiles. These are much smaller and tougher than the blankets and are bonded to side and bottom areas of the shuttle subjected to the highest heat. While there appeared to be no damage to electrical or electronic systems, `` we wo n't know for sure until we power up the vehicle,'' <PERSON> Utsman </PERSON> said. He said investigators should know within a few days if the launch will be delayed. `` If we have to replace only a couple hundred blankets, there should n't be a hit,'' <PERSON> Utsman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Utsman </PERSON> said the accident occurred Sunday after three workers performed routine maintenance on the water sprinkler system in the building where the shuttle was being processed. When the workers finished the job, they tested the system by pressurizing it, but a gate valve that they were certain was closed failed and water began flowing from sprinklers in one of six safety zones. `` Two other workers who tried to help inadvertently turned on the other sprinklers'' and water poured onto work platforms and splashed onto the shuttle, <PERSON> Utsman </PERSON> said. Other workers were able to quickly turn off the water. He did not know the amount of water released. He said a small amount of water leaked into the closed cargo bay but did n't damage electronic systems there. He said no water entered the crew cabin.

 East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> appeared in public for the first time six weeks after gallbladder surgery, putting to rest rumors he was gravely ill but facing a crisis posed by an exodus to the West. West German officials say the number of East Germans that have fled to the West since <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> opened the floodgates on Sept. 11 has surpassed 20,000. As Communist East <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> nears its 40th anniversary, its leaders say they are discussing reforms that could stop the flow of refugees to the West, a phenomenon that is draining the country's labor pool The 77-year-old <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> resumed some official duties Monday as about 8,000 people demonstrated in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> to protest his government's refusal Monday to grant legal status to a pro-democracy group called New Forum. <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> police arrested scores of demonstrators, many of whom sang `` We Shall Overcome,'' and shouted such slogans as `` Liberty, Equality, Fraternity!'' <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, who had not been seen in public since Aug. 14, resumed some official duties on Monday, meeting with the new ambassadors of <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. East German <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> sources said the party chief was expected to fully resume his duties by Oct. 7, when the country marks its 40th anniversary. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is expected in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> for the ceremonies. After his mid-August surgery, some West German media reports said <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s condition may have been more serious than indicated by East German officials and that he had lost the will to live. The East German leadership has been hampered by <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s protracted recovery, leading one <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> official to call the country a `` ship without a captain. West German media have said that some East German Communist leaders have accused <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> of misjudging the meaning and scope of the exodus to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which grants East Germans automatic citizenship because its constitution does not recognize the division of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, a hard-line Communist who has led <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since 1971, has staunchly resisted reforms sweeping much of the Soviet bloc. As of early Monday, 20,130 East Germans had fled through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since the channel to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> was opened, West German border police said. In addition, more than 1,200 East German refugees waited in cramped West German Embassy compounds in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, hoping a diplomatic solution could be worked out to allow them to get to the West. East and West German officials spoke several times by telephone Monday trying to reach a compromise on the embassy occupations, said <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmuelling </PERSON>, a West German government spokesman. <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> is hoping to find a quick solution and the talks are in a `` highly sensitive phase,'' <PERSON> Schmuelling </PERSON> told reporters. In <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief for the East German city of <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> said he thinks changes are needed to stop East Germans from leaving their homeland. <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> said he agreed with a recent remark by retired East German intelligence chief <PERSON> Markus </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> that the East German government must think over the causes of the East German exodus. `` On this point I am of the same opinion as my friend <PERSON> Mischa </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> said on the first day of a four-day visit to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>, however, refused to say what kind of reforms are needed in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` This is something we have to discuss at home, not here,'' he said. The number of East Germans occupying West German embassies in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, has nearly reached its saturation point, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> government sources said. About 980 East Germans have sought refuge inside the <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> compound and 300 at the embassy in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, the sources said. Their numbers have grown by 50 to 100 per day over the past week.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> admitted to mistakes in judgment during a speech announcing his re-election, and promised to return $ 18,000 in campaign contributions from people linked to a defense contractor. <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> also said Monday he would take `` ultimate responsibility'' for the embezzlement of $ 7,275 of his former top aide, who committed suicide in May 1988 by jumping from a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> hotel. `` Mistakes were made by my staff. I have made mistakes of judgment,'' the five-term Democrat told several hundred supporters. `` I regret the controversy these matters have caused, but I want the people of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> to know that these were mistakes of the head, not of the heart.'' <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> procurement subcommittee, said he was returning the contributions from employees and consultants for <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>, which is under investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for possible contract procurement violations. `` I am returning these funds because individual pleas entered as part of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s ` Ill Winds' investigation point to a systematic attempt on the part of <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> to circumvent the federal laws governing campaign contributions,'' said <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>. The investigation involves charges that defense firms or their employees hired private consultants who bribed <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials for information needed to win multimillion-dollar contracts. The congressman also said he would donate to charity a $ 2,000 speaking fee he received from the <ORGANIZATION> Oshkosh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trucking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on the day he voted in favor of a bill that benefited the company. <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> said he will report the apparent violations in accepting the speaking fee to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` Because of these errors, I anticipate that the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> will levy a fine which the campaign will pay to the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> as a civil penalty for the violations,'' <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> also told supporters that the late <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>, his former top aide, had improperly pocketed $ 7,275 in campaign funds. `` I must accept ultimate responsibility for these errors in judgment because <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> was my campaign manager,'' <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> said. `` I was not aware that <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> was writing checks to staff members and asking them to cash those checks and return the cash to him.'' <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Luna </PERSON>, an attorney who describes himself as `` an all but declared'' <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate for <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>'s seat, said the congressman's admissions were welcomed but did n't go far enough in explaining his connection to <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Money Issue May Slow Efforts for Consensus</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants a consensus on improving schools at the education summit starting Wednesday _ not more funds for a `` basically well-fed'' system _ but some governors say more money is a key issue. `` I do n't think you're going to find a consensus'' on the issue of money, said <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON>, a Republican who chairs the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and several key Republican governors are adamant that the two days of discussions at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, will not focus on more money for schools. `` The educational system is basically well-fed but it's undernourished, and we must find innovative, accountable ways to improve performance,'' the president told reporters at a recent briefing However, a key concern of some governors, particularly Democrats, is that without a federal financial commitment, the states and local governments will be forced to reshuffle scarce cash or impose higher taxes. `` We have enormous problems to surmount if we are to educate our children, and we need a real federal commitment to that effort, not just rhetoric,'' said <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, a Democrat who said that during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration the federal share of school funds fell to 6 percent from 9 percent. `` The real problem for the federal government and the president ... is how do you shift resources for greater investment instead of ending up simply lecturing people on things they ought to do without any real help,'' said <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, a Democrat. `` I am hopeful we will see some increased federal funding for education,'' added <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mickelson </PERSON>, a Republican. `` But the federal government needs to balance its budget. I think they are going to, rather than give us a whole lot of money, begin to set an agenda and hold us accountable in the spending of the money.'' States already are pumping huge sums into education. For example, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> spent $ 4,069 per pupil in 1987-88, up from $ 1,524 per pupil in 1978-79. <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a Democrat, said that over the past 10 years, state financial support for public schools has risen by more than 100 percent. <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> said, `` I think there is a feeling that there is considerable amount of money being spent on education. We want to spend it as wisely as possible.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who vowed to be the `` education president,'' has indicated a willingness to free states from cumbersome federal rules that dictate how some federal funds are spent. Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> said it would be a mistake for governors to `` hammer'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the meeting for federal funding, but he stressed he would like more federal money for preschool programs such as Head Start. According to <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON>, the money for basic kindergarten through 12th grade education should be provided by states. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON>, a Democrat, agreed. `` In terms of federal funding, my biggest priority is for the federal government to expand Head Start so that every eligible child has an opportunity to enroll.'' Educators said only about 20 percent of the eligible students are served by the Head Start program that cost the government $ 1.2 billion last year. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed a $ 250 million increase. Money could overshadow discussions on other topics such as allowing parents to choose which public school their children will attend, restructuring the learning environment, revitalizing the teaching profession, and the proper role of government in education. The parental choice issue is the centerpiece of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s education initiatives, and conservatives want the president to promote the issue by challenging the governors to advance the idea at home. Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said, `` the issue of equity and transportation are key to the issue of choice.'' Asked who would pay for school buses to take children to the school of their parents' choice, he said, `` It's going to be a state-by-state solution and it's going to be worked out.''

 You know all that junk mail that falls through your mail slot every day? If the envelope is just plain brown, it breaks <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON>'s heart. <PERSON> Garland </PERSON> is a sales representative for the <ORGANIZATION> Tension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Envelope </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a firm which produces about one-fifth of all the envelopes used by the direct mail industry. His territory is central <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and he single-handedly sells 100 million envelopes a year, enough to fill 70 semi-trailers. Direct mail is big business, getting bigger. Tension Envelope has plants in 11 cities, many working two or three shifts, six days a week, making envelopes, headed for your mailbox. <PERSON> Garland </PERSON> was selling envelopes here Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> Direct </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s 72nd annual conference and exhibition, which attracted 8,000 people in the direct mail and telephone selling business and the people who serve them, like <PERSON> Garland </PERSON>. `` A plain brown envelope is insane,'' said <PERSON> Garland </PERSON>. `` The biggest opportunity for blowing the product's whistle is lost.'' He stood before a display of envelopes that were anything but plain. Some had rippled edges _ `` zippers'' to the trade _ that all but compel the recipient to open the envelope, which is the point. The latest wrinkle in envelopes is one in which the address flap flips over, allowing the recipient to reply using the original envelope. It saves storage space, <PERSON> Garland </PERSON> explained: `` If you insert a return envelope into the outgoing envelope, and you're using a million envelopes a month, you've got to find space for 2 million envelopes, not 1 million.'' Direct marketing likes big numbers. Some 88.5 million Americans, it brags, bought something through the mail in 1988, and the average mail-order purchase amounted to $ 74. The compilation of mailing lists, as might be imagined, is big business because `` targeting'' _ sending the pitch to the most likely customer _ is the name of the game. The American <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> List </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Neck </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, offers lists of students from kindergarten through graduate school. For $ 50 a thousand, you can buy the names and home and school addresses of 146,983 biology majors. <ORGANIZATION> PCS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mailing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> List </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is even more specialized. It will sell you the names and addresses of 11,438 air traffic controllers, 16,600 subscribers to Tax Angles; 15,547 auto wheel and frame alignment shops; 1,381 disc jockeys; 7,260 T-shirt stores; 425,000 `` high income women''; 10,620 hair and wig dealers or 532,390 professors. And National Demographics and <ORGANIZATION> Lifestyles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, pitching its `` relevant'' lists in a comic book, refers to folks who respond to direct marketing as `` respondoids'' and describes them as `` ever hopeful yet enslaved mail responsive mortals'' who `` long to fill out questionnaires about themselves and receive relevant mail.'' National Demographics gathers its lists from respondoids who fill out those consumer questionnaires or product registration cards that come with new hair dryers and toasters. Only 7 percent, the company says, check the little box indicating they want to be on no one's mail list. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Caugherty </PERSON>, director of the association's Shop at Home Information Center, says most people like direct marketing. The 3,500-member association has developed codes of conduct to protect those who do n't. A 15-page pamphlet spells out the ethics of the business -LRB- `` free'' should mean `` a product or service which is offered without cost or obligation'' -RRB-. Another, aimed at policing those telephone sales calls, says the callers should not make offers `` in the guise of research or a survey when the real intent is to sell products or services or to raise funds.'' As for the latest twist, telephone machines which make a recorded sales pitch, the rules say `` a live operator'' should first introduce the recorded message. Moreover, the guidelines say, calls should n't be made `` during hours which are unreasonable to the recipients.'' Whether that's supper time, the guidelines do n't say.

<HEAD>Auto Industry Protests Public Service Spot Attacking Cars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Assoicated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Few viewers are seeing it yet, but the auto industry already is crying foul over a public service ad on global warming that environmentalists are sending to radio and TV stations nationwide. And <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> wants equal time. The ad was unveiled a week ago by the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which said it was distributing the 30-second spots to hundreds of radio and television stations to spread the warning about global warming and, specifically, what part the automobile plays. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vehicle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, quickly dispatched a letter to 200 TV stations and 850 radio stations calling the ad `` clearly political'' and full of misinformation. He wrote that if the environmentalists' spots are used as a public service announcement `` we intend to demand equal time to rebut the misinformation and misleading material they contain.'' On Monday, <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>, executive director of the Washington-based environmental group, distributed a copy of <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON>'s letter at a news conference and accused the industry group of trying to `` muzzle public education on the environmental impact of automobiles. She characterized the industry's call for equal time as `` ludicrous'' and denied the thrust of the 30-second advertisement, which calls pollution from automobiles `` a major cause'' of global warming, is misleading. In a telephone interview, <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> defended his Sept. 19 letter to the radio and TV stations. <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> charged the environmentalists were misusing free air time under public service provisions by making a political statement and `` advancing their legislative agenda ... That's grass roots lobbying.'' He maintained the ad overstates the threat of global warming, which he said was still disputed in the scientific community, and puts too much of the blame on pollution from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automobiles. Carbon dioxide, which is released in the burning of fossil fuels, is a major contributor to the so-called `` greenhouse effect'' _ the creation of a gaseous veil in the atmosphere. Scientists are concerned that if accumulation of these `` greenhouse'' gases goes unchecked, the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> may warm significantly by the middle of the next century. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automobiles, however, are only one source of carbon dioxide and are believed to be the source of only about 2.5 percent of all the greenhouse gases worldwide, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Nevertheless, a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from motor vehicles and other sources is widely seen as essential to reducing the global warming threat. The environmental group's 30-second spot opens with a shot directly into the sun and the announcer calling global warming `` a disease of the Earth.'' It quickly pans a desert landscape and then shifts to highway and city streets clogged with cars and trucks while the announcer says `` a major cause of global warming'' is pollution from automobiles. `` We need more fuel efficient cars,'' continues the announcer over a scene of a family with its car, followed by a closeup of arid, parched earth. <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> said he would not object if the spots were run as paid advertisements that give a point of view, but said the environmentalists should not be given free air time. `` Detroit spends millions of dollars each year to advertise their new model cars and light trucks,'' replied Ms. <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>. `` For the industry to request free air time to respond to our modest public education campaign is ludicrous.'' <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> said there are no plans to prepare a counter-ad in case equal time is granted by a TV or radio operator. But he said spokesmen would be available to `` make people aware there's another point of view.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Republican <PERSON> Hispanic </PERSON> says conditions for Hispanic youth are n't as bad as described by a federal study and by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, who served at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, provoked strong disagreement with her testimony at a hearing on Hispanic children Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION>, Youth and Families. She disputed remarks Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> made last week when he released a report on school dropouts and said the rate among Hispanic students is `` a national tragedy.'' `` The future looks quite good for individual Hispanics,'' said <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>. `` Native-born Hispanics, despite the ominous report from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, appear to be staying in school longer,'' she said. She challenged the statistical basis for the report and said the department's finding, like other statistical studies of Hispanics, were skewed by large influxes of recent immigrants _ arriving at a rate she estimated at 400,000 a year. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> said Hispanic immigrants will eventually move into the economic mainstream as have earlier <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> immigrants, who also faced high dropout rates in their first generations. The studies `` diminish the very real and significant progress'' of Hispanics in this country. Her remarks put her at odds, however, with a panel of Hispanic experts appearing with her before the committee, who cited severe poverty and education problems among Hispanics. `` She's not right,'' said <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosewater </PERSON>, staff director of the committee, following the hearing. `` They -LRB- other expert witnesses -RRB- made a very clear point. There's lots of research showing not just first generation, but second and third generation -LRB- Hispanics -RRB- are not doing well in school.'' <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinojosa </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> said Hispanics of varying national origins are falling further behind economically.

<HEAD>Some Sixth Graders Use Cocaine Every Week, Survey Shows</HEAD>

 Some sixth-graders say they use cocaine as often as every week, according to a survey released today that shows an `` alarming trend'' of drug use among junior high school students. At the same time, illicit use of drugs and alcohol declined among high school students, according to the nonscientific survey of almost 400,000 secondary school students by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parents </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. `` Whereas we have seen some drops -LRB- in drug use -RRB- at the upper grades, at the lower grades there is an alarming trend of more use,'' said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, vice president of PRIDE. Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleaton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of the Atlanta-based drug prevention organization that has been conducting the nationwide surveys since 1982, said the study `` detected weekly cocaine use in the sixth grade.'' Of the 29,116 sixth-graders who responded to the question about cocaine use, about 233 said they used cocaine weekly or daily, according to the report. About 58 sixth-graders said they used cocaine once or twice a month, and another 87 sixth-graders said they used cocaine one to six times a year, the survey found. The survey covered 392,003 students in grades 6 to 12 who answered the anonymous questionnaire given in 958 schools in 38 states, according to PRIDE. Overall for junior high students, of the 161,907 who responded to the question on cocaine use, 0.7 percent or 1,133 said they used it weekly or daily; an equal number used it infrequently and 648 said they used it once or twice a month. The study showed 24.9 percent of junior high school students said they had drunk an alcoholic beverage this year. Two years ago 26.3 percent said they had done so, and in 1984-85, 21.2 percent said they had. In senior high school grades _ 9-12 _ the use of cocaine, marijuana, beer and liquor declined from the levels of two and four years ago, the study found. A total of 4.6 percent of the 223,036 students in grades 9-12 who responded to the question on cocaine use said they used the drug this year, compared with 5.7 percent four years ago and 6.4 percent two years ago, the PRIDE survey found. Of the 10,260 this year who said they used cocaine, 2,900 said they used it weekly or daily, according to the report. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> Seniors Survey, released in February, also found that drug abuse among high school seniors declined last year, reaching its lowest level since 1975. That survey by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> found that the proportion of seniors who have used cocaine at least once in their lifetime dropped from 15 percent in 1987 to 12 percent in 1988. <PERSON> Gleaton </PERSON> said only 22 percent of the senior class of 1989 was drug-free, with the other 78 percent saying they had used a drug or alcoholic beverage in the previous year. `` It is a matter of grave concern to the nation that thousands of young and promising brains are being impaired daily,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nahas </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surgeons </ORGANIZATION>, who is PRIDE's medical advisor. Cigarette smoking, while not considered a drug by PRIDE, gained popularity in all the grades surveyed, with 38.7 percent of high school students and 28.1 percent of junior high school students saying they had smoked a cigarette, increases over both two and four years ago. Extrapolating from the survey, PRIDE estimated that 690,000 American students in grades 6-12 tried cocaine last year and about 223,000 used cocaine weekly or daily. PRIDE did not provide a margin of error for this estimate, however.

<HEAD>Bush's Global Ban Unlikely to Fly in Libya, Iran</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chemical weapons proposal might play in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> but his call for a global ban is not likely to get much of a hearing in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which are thought to possess the grisly substances, experts say. Addressing the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Monday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proclaimed readiness to destroy 80 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chemical weapons if <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> follows suit, and urged other nations to sign a multilateral pact to outlaw them entirely. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal `` made virtue of necessity,'' said one senior senator, because in 1985 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed a law requiring the destruction of all old chemical weapons by 1997, while authorizing production of a new generation. `` I consider it a good, positive move,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` Getting the Soviets to join in would be very good, and if both superpowers lead the way bilaterally, I think it will give some impetus to the overall world move in that direction _ which is the ultimate objective.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are the only two states to acknowledge having chemical weapons, although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that as many as 20 nations possess or have the capability of producing them. Experts have estimated up to a dozen nations can make chemical weapons. There was no explanation from the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION> for the figure of 20 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> used. Delegates to the 40-Nation Conference on Disarmament ended their most recent meeting in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> last month without any indication of an agreement on a chemical weapons ban. The conference, which meets again in November, is stalled on the issue of how to monitor the production of chemical weapons, which experts say can be made in factories similar to those that make fertilizer or other compounds. Also in dispute are the size of chemical weapons stockpiles, and even the number of countries that have them. The extent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stockpile is classified, although private analysts estimate it at 30,000 tons. Soviet spokesman said their government had `` no more than 50,000 tons of chemical warfare agents.'' It may take more than a superpower deal, however, to provide rid the planet of chemical weapons, according to two private arms control experts in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal `` might focus international attention on chemical weapons and lead to a multilateral treaty,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Feinstein </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a disarmament lobby in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. But it may instead produce a U.S.-Soviet agreement and divert attention from production by other countries, he said. <PERSON> Elisa </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call `` a pretty disappointing response from a president who has committed himself to eliminating chemical weapons from the face of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>.'' She said it was unlikely to win the support of <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, who <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence accuses of trying to build a chemical weapons plant. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> has said the plant is for pharmaceuticals. `` We are giving the Gadhafis of the world a veto power. We are saying that we will not implement the treaties until the Gadhafis agree to it,'' said <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. Other nations thought able to make their own chemical weapons are <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and probably <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, she said. Other uncertainties surrounded <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal. `` There are questions whether the proposal would require the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to destroy any of the binary weapons that it is now producing,'' said <PERSON> Feinstein </PERSON>. In 1987, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ended an 18-year moratorium on the making of chemical weapons, but the current and planned level of binary production is classified. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not announce an end to production of the new generation of binary chemical weapons, in which two toxic chemicals mix to form a lethal chemical. Since the size of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stockpile is secret, it was not clear exactly how many weapons <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was proposing to destroy. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has already started destroying its old chemical weapons. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> suspended chemical weapon production on Dec. 26, 1987, seven months after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> resumed production, and they said their stockpile consisted of the nerve agents Sarin, <PERSON> Soman </PERSON>, VX, two mustard blistering agents, and one irritant. They have said they will destroy some chemical weapons, but not spelled out how many.

 A couple suffering from cerebral palsy were killed when the electric blanket on their waterbed caught fire and they were unable to escape their apartment, according to police. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> and <PERSON> Loral </PERSON> <PERSON> Roser </PERSON>, both 44, were trapped as the fire spread early Monday through their apartment in a self-care facility for about 150 elderly and handicapped people, said Lt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Fairfax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Investigators say the blanket may have been improperly tucked under the couple's waterbed on one of fall's first cool nights, said <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>. Because of their cerebral palsy, the couple, who were married for three years, needed wheelchairs to run errands and used canes in their home. They appeared to have been overcome by heavy smoke before they could flee the apartment, fire officials said. Residents of <ORGANIZATION> Lockwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> live in apartments structured for their needs. In addition to smoke detectors, each unit is equipped with emergency cords in the bedrooms and bathrooms that make an electrical panel at the front desk light up and buzz, said <PERSON> Nevine </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>, a district manager for the company. A desk clerk heard the emergency buzzer about 1:30 a.m. Monday, but found thick smoke when he want to the apartment after summoning the fire department, said <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>. <PERSON> Roser </PERSON> apparently was fatally overcome as he pulled an emergency cord, fire officials said.

 The board which runs the city's oldest art museum is trying to come up with a plan to defuse a controversy over the cancellation of an exhibit which contained sexually explicit photographs. However, the Corcoran Gallery of Art trustees reaffirmed their support Monday for <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr-Cahall </PERSON>, the museum's director, who made the cancellation decision. The Corcoran has been criticized for three months in the wake of Ms. <PERSON> Orr-Cahall </PERSON>'s cancellation of an exhibition of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON> photographs. The cancellation was made with the consent of the <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON>'s board of trustees.

At a regularly scheduled meeting Monday, the <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> board agreed to appoint a special panel of trustees to examine the three-month controversy and recommend steps to defuse it.

 A man under investigation in the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> serial killings will be transferred to federal custody in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> to face charges he possessed a firearm while a fugitive, a magistrate ordered. Police, meanwhile, disclosed that <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> talked for the first time with <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, which is investigating the slayings of up to 48 young women in the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> from 1982-84. The interview failed to clear up a number of investigators' questions, said <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police Capt <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, who heads the task force. On Monday, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> completed a sentence at the King County jail. He had been jailed there since his January arrest in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> for escaping from a work-release facility while serving a term for burglary in 1981. During a hearing Monday before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>, the 38-year-old <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> agreed to the transfer to <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>. If convicted on the firearms count, he could be sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined $ 250,000, said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dohrmann </PERSON>, assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney. The <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has characterized <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> as a `` viable suspect'' in its investigation into the deaths of 40 women and the disappearances of eight others.

No charges related to the killings have been filed against <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, who has denied he is the killer.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> once implored a young tradesman to `` remember that time is money.'' Time, in a curious way, has given a new twist to his advice. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, apparently willing to test whether a penny saved is a penny earned, left bequests to the cities of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> _ 1,000 pounds sterling each. In the nearly 200 years since his death April 17, 1790, the money has grown in trusts to millions of dollars. When the 200th anniversary of his death arrives, state and city officials _ in accordance with his will _ will decide what to do with the money. In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, the prospect has started people thinking. `` Rather than just see it go to <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> museum, we should try to be more creative,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Fumo </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Democrat who is shopping around for worthy causes. He referred to the <ORGANIZATION> Franklin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a science museum in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` I think it should be something symbolic of <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Fumo </PERSON> added, noting that the city's bequest had grown to $ 2 million in a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> trust. In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> also is looking for `` creative solutions,'' said his spokesman, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> share, also administered in a trust, has grown to about $ 4 million, <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> said. At the 100th anniversary of <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>'s death, some of the money was designated for public works in both cities, a request made in the will. On the 200th anniversary, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> specified that the money should be divided between state and city governments, with about three-quarters going to the states and one-quarter to the cities. That would give the state of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> about $ 1.5 million and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> $ 500,000. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> could receive $ 3 million and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> $ 1 million. But it's unclear how the money will be used. There are ideas, but no plans have been approved. <PERSON> Fumo </PERSON> said he has been asked to consider using the money for an arts fund, but wants the state to weigh as many options as possible. As a starting point, he has introduced legislation to give the state's share to the <ORGANIZATION> Franklin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, officials have been reviewing the issue for about two years, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>, executive secretary for the city's trust office He said a recommendation was expected next year. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> asked that the money be used to help young `` artificers,'' meaning craftsmen or inventors, and in a way, that's what it's been doing in the hands of the trusts. In <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, much of the money is invested in mortgages. In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, the bulk of the money has been used for loans to medical students. <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> said there is interest in continuing to use the money for student loans. `` He really understood the value of thinking for the future,'' <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> said of the inventor, philosopher and statesman. `` He really had a lot of faith in this county. He wanted to help those who helped him.''

 An accident at a construction site left three men dead and three others hospitalized for burns suffered when a scaffolding came in contact with power lines carrying enough electricity to supply a small town. The men were moving the 25-foot scaffolding Monday when it struck lines carrying 69,000 volts, said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Reardon </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Target </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the general contractor. No one was on the scaffolding. `` It appears to me a bunch of guys were pushing the scaffold from one job site to another and just did n't look up.

 Residents who got their first look at the devastation wrought by Hurricane Hugo say it will be years before this barrier island returns to being a quaint seaside village. `` On a normal day, this was like being in heaven,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Traywick </PERSON>, whose first floor was buried under an inch of muck. `` It's not like that any more,'' <PERSON> Traywick </PERSON> said. `` Not for a long time.'' The island, heavily damaged by wind and water and cut off from the mainland because of a downed bridge, was declared under martial law. Island officials on Monday began a daily ferry service allowing some residents to return home for a few hours. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s 135 mph winds bashed the island, located across the harbor from <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, and a wall of water swept through homes and businesses. Few houses were left undamaged, most of the taller trees were felled and huge potholes were scooped out of the roads. The beach has shifted, and the entire marina dock was torn loose from its pilings and swept to nearby <LOCATION> Goat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` It looks like what happens after artillery fire,'' said resident <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officer who served in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> during World War II. For many residents, angry at what they consider government inaction in getting them on the island, it was a relief to see what <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> had wrought. `` I'm glad to know what the situation is,'' said <PERSON> Traywick </PERSON>. `` At least I know. Now we can sit down and get started on some plans.'' For <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bozzelli </PERSON>, it would n't have made much difference when he got to the island. His house, now split open like an overripe melon, is about 50 yards from where it was last week. `` I pretty well figured it might be gone,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> began work Monday on a temporary pontoon bridge linking Isle of Palms, and adjacent <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, to the mainland. Isle of Palms City Councilman <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON> said that should give most residents of the islands land access by week's end. Monday afternoon, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> barges transported bulldozers to the island to clear the fallen trees. Most residents said they would return to rebuild, even with the first-hand knowledge of what a powerful hurricane can do. `` I think most people will be back,'' said <PERSON> Muriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, who owns a house and a rental duplex on the island. `` It's like an addiction, the laid-back style and the quiet.'' <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, manager of the Sea Cabins development that once existed on the beach, said the cabins would be rebuilt. `` It's the tranquillity of the island when it's not under a storm seige,'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said. `` It'll be back to that one of these days.''

<TEXT>
 The key index on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> rose sharply to end at yet another high Tuesday, and the dollar ended slightly lower against the Japanese yen. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 484.11 points, or 1.38 percent, the second-largest one-day gain this year, ending the day at 35,444.82. It gained 188.92 points Monday. This year's largest one-day advance, 793.96 points, was recorded March 28. The dollar closed at 142.80 yen, down 0.15 yen from Monday's close of 142.95 yen It opened lower at 142.25 yen and ranged between 142.10 yen and 143.15 yen. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency's low opening followed its overnight plunge overseas after coordinated dollar-selling interventions, including actions by the central banks of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, traders said. The currency finished at 142.13 yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Monday, almost four yen lower than Friday's 146.05-yen close. Finance ministers and central bankers from the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> industrialized countries agreed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Saturday that they will closely cooperate in foreign exchange markets to stem the dollar's strength. <PERSON> Minori </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeuchi </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, said the dollar inched up in the morning when quite a few dollar-buying orders against the West German mark came from <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, but later trading was mixed as participants made position adjustments. Ms. <PERSON> Takeuchi </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> intervened intermittently and sold small amount of dollars to halt a new upswing, but the amount of selling was unknown. The central bank does not comment on its monetary actions. `` For a while, the dollar is unlikely to rise back much, because the <ORGANIZATION> G-7 </ORGANIZATION> central banks will coordinate intervention actively,'' Ms. <PERSON> Takeuchi </PERSON> added. On the stock exchange, `` The Nikkei seems to have entered its uptrend finally,'' said <PERSON> Masahiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Umemori </PERSON>, a stock analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. He attributed the index's consistent rise to the yen's rebound against the dollar following the <ORGANIZATION> G-7 </ORGANIZATION> monetary talks.

<HEAD>Jiang Denies Suppression Of Pro-Democracy Movement A Tragedy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON> today denied that the military suppression of the pro-democracy movement was a tragedy, calling the assault an unavoidable response to an attempt to overthrow the government. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>, in his first news conference since being named to head the 48-million member party in June, also indicated that the party had yet to decide whether <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s supreme leader, will be allowed to retire from his last official post. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> was joined by the other five members of the <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the ruling party's top decision-making group, including conservative Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>. Some 400 Chinese and foreign reporters attended the conference, which was broadcast live on national television. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>, a former party boss in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> who replaced the ousted reformist <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> on June 24, said of the June clash between pro-democracy protesters and the army: `` We believe it was not a tragedy.'' He called the pro-democracy movement a `` counter-revolutionary rebellion aimed at negating the leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> and overthrowing the socialist system.'' The June 3-4 military attack on student-led protesters in central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> was unavoidable, he said, because of foreign forces trying to undermine <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s socialist system and a handful of people within <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> who `` engaged in all kinds of conspiracies in an attempt to overthrow the existing government.'' The army killed hundreds of unarmed civilians in the assault. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>, 63, who reportedly has been named by <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> to succeed him as top leader when he leaves the political scene, said `` much is at stake'' in the question of when the 85-year-old <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> should leave his last post, as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. He noted that <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> had on numerous occasions expressed a wish to pass on power to a new generation, but it was still up to the party and state to decide when the architect of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s past decade of economic reforms can step down. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> did not mention a party decision, revealed in May by <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, to continue accepting <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s leadership on major issues regardless of his formal resignation from all but the military post. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s resignation from that post would not be likely to alter his position as the final arbiter of political matters, but would reflect his efforts to put in place successors he trusts. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> acknowledged that the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which could make a formal ruling on <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s retirement, will be meeting soon to map out economic development plans for the next two or three years. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> and the others refused to answer repeated questions on the number of people arrested and executed in the crackdown on dissent. <PERSON> Qiao </PERSON> <PERSON> Shi </PERSON>, who is responsible for legal matters within the party, said `` we have dealt with some people'' but all those executed were convicted of serious crimes. He said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has acted prudently toward students and intellectuals and called a foreign report of 120,000 arrests since June `` unfounded nonsense.'' <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>, told by a reporter that a woman student had been sent to the countryside after participating in the pro-democracy movement and been raped there by peasants, described the case as `` a fairy tale out of The Arabian Nights.'' He stressed that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s policy toward students who demanded democratic reform was `` to unite them and educate them.'' Since taking office <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> has pressed for greater attention to ideological matters, particularly among young people. He indicated that in this way he could escape the fate of his two predecessors, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> and the late <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>. Both were purged for failing to combat Western liberal ideas while trying to open <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> up to the world. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> declined to say what will happen to <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>. He said the party was `` making further investigations'' into charges <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> supported the pro-democracy movement and thus split the party. Both <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> and <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s rival for power, blamed <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> for letting the political unrest get out of hand, but <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>'s tone indicated <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> may escape criminal charges. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> said the party recognized that <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> had done some positive things in his nine years as premier and party general secretary. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, who has not been seen in public since he went to central Tiananmen Square on May 19 to talk to student hunger strikers, is leading a `` quiet and comfortable life,'' <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> added that since <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> had served the party longer than he had: `` He enjoys better treatment, in fact he enjoys a better salary than me.'' On other topics, Vice Premier <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> <PERSON> Yilin </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, reiterated that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will stick to such economic reforms as developing export-oriented industries along the coast. He said private enterprise would continue to play a `` necessary and beneficial supplemental role'' in the socialist economy but added that `` appropriate restrictions'' would check the growth of private industry. Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> spoke at length on corruption, a major issue during the spring protests, saying the party was taking the lead by cracking down on nepotism, use of luxury imported cars, overseas trips, gift-giving and banqueting at public expense. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>, like the other five speakers, was dressed in a dark Western suit and tie. A former student in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> who also speaks good English, he used a Russian phrase in answering a question from a Soviet journalist and used English words on several occasions.

 Three of four Americans believe President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for a tax increase despite his campaign pledge that he would not raise taxes, according to a poll published today. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll also found resounding approval for the way <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is handling his job. The poll found that 73 percent believe <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will request a tax increase during the next four years. The percent finding is the same as in a Times-CBS poll in January. The poll indicated that 69 percent of the public generally approves of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s job performance and 18 percent disapproves. The poll also indicated that: _ 79 percent believe <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be able to maintain good relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ 51 percent think <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will not reduce the drug problem significantly _ 54 percent think the environment will not improve significantly _ 57 percent believe he will improve education The poll, based on telephone interviews with 1,347 adults nationwide from Sept. 17 to Sept. 20, had margin of error of plus or minus 3 points. While most of the poll was good news for the president, the same was not true for Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Only 13 percent had a favorable view of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, with 19 percent had an unfavorable opinion of him. About 45 percent said they knew too little about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to form an opinion about him.

 He's got dark legs, closely cropped hair, and is about 4-feet-8. And, at the behest of a group of matchmakers, he recently flew from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> to ease the loss of two widowed mares. He's an Asian wild horse, otherwise known as <PERSON> Przewalski </PERSON>'s horse, and his mission is to be fruitful and multiply, especially now that his kind are extinct in the wild. Where he goes and with whom he breeds is up to a group of about 1,000 zoologists meeting at a downtown hotel this week to determine the fate of more than 7,000 animals from 50 endangered species kept in North American zoos and aquariums. What happens then is up to Mother Nature. `` We recognize that we can make a genetic plan, but we're dealing with individual animals and they do n't always read the books we do But so far, he's showing the right interests,'' <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryder </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. Ryder oversees the captive breeding of <PERSON> Przewalski </PERSON>'s horses through the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> and Aquariums, an umbrella organization of 140 institutions in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The organization is trying to rescue animals from extinction by breeding them in captivity with the hopes of eventually reintroducing them to the wild. `` Zoos ca n't hope to save everything. They can only hope to save a small portion of the species of the world,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Meritt </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a board member of the association and assistant director of the Lincoln Park Zoo in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` It's better than not having anything,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Grisham </PERSON>, of the <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zoo </LOCATION>, who oversees the nationwide breeding of cheetahs. `` Remember the bison. Back at the turn of the century, there was just a handful and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> took them to the <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and they started breeding again. They're the basis of all the bison in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Grisham </PERSON> said. But problems remain. `` Any place in the world today there's a problem with finding space for wild animals,'' said Ryder. `` Whether they continue to exist is completely up to one species _ us. It's our decision whether we make the space and provide them with protection to survive. It's up to us. Do nothing, and they're gone.'' The association counts several successes among its special survival plans. Only about 50 <LOCATION> Bali </LOCATION> mynah birds remain in the wild, but American zoos have been so successful in breeding them that several hundred are expected to be released into the rain forests of <LOCATION> Bali </LOCATION> in coming years, <PERSON> Meritt </PERSON> said. There are no known free-ranging Arabian oryx, a type of antelope once found on the Arabian peninsula. But thanks to captive breeding, the oryx is being returned to the desert, <PERSON> Meritt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foose </PERSON>, association coordinator of the species survival plans for all the zoos, said zookeepers want to spread animal genes around different zoos to avoid sterility, mutations and other problems in breeding. `` Our objective is to stop evolution and preserve as much as the gene pool as we can get these animals back in the wild and let natural selection sort it all out again,'' <PERSON> Foose </PERSON> said.

 Congressional investigators say that almost a year after a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jet exploded over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> ca n't say that its promised tighter security precautions are in place. Airlines are not meeting their security requirements and the training of security workers appears to be the biggest problem, according to a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report that was summarized Monday by a congresswoman. `` <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has not established minimum training standards needed to ensure that airline security personnel working at high risk airports overseas are sufficiently trained to carry out required security measures,'' Rep. <PERSON> Cardiss </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, D-Ill., quoted <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, as saying <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said the full report would remain secret, but she said investigators found the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> `` can not assure itself that required security procedures are being properly carried out by the airlines at designated high-risk airports.'' Airlines are responsible for security at airport gates, generally using guidelines set by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>. The airports considered high-risk for Americans were identified during the hearing as those in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Two hundred seventy people died when <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103, which started in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and stopped in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, blew up over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, last Dec. 21. Investigators found the mid-air explosion was caused by a bomb in a radio cassette player. The Syrian-backed Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> is considered the prime suspect behind the act, though the group's leader has denied involvement. Witnesses told the hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Government Operations government activities and transportation subcommittee, which <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> chairs, that intelligence about anti-American groups likely to attack airlines is n't good enough. `` Security begins with an understanding of the threat it faces; our intelligence services must provide this understanding,'' said <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> expert on terrorism, now president of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` They do n't do it especially well, and it is n't especially easy to do,'' he said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> should have an independent intelligence capability.'' <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>, managing director of corporate security of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the government should take more responsibility for combatting travel dangers and should share some intelligence with airlines. `` Information like the types of passports these groups are using,'' <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> said. `` When information is floating around that a group is planning something, we should be told.'' <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> was fined recently for alleged security lapses at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Frankfort </LOCATION>'s airport, including failure to properly screen passengers, improperly checking some carry-on baggage and failure to search cargo areas before loading. About a dozen members of two organizations of family members of passengers on Flight 103 also told the congressional panel the government should get tougher on security. `` Placing responsibility for security procedures in the hands of airlines is a conflict of interest,'' said testimony prepared by the <ORGANIZATION> Victims </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103. `` Airlines are in the business to make money. Precious dollars are cut from vital security budgets to raise bottom-line profits.''

 A judge ordered former Temptations lead singer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruffin </PERSON> to jail because he showed up five hours late for a hearing. <PERSON> Ruffin </PERSON>, who was in court on a probation violation charge, was scheduled for a 9 a.m. hearing Monday before Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>. When <PERSON> Ruffin </PERSON> arrived just before 2 p.m., <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Ruffin </PERSON> to spend the night in jail and said the court would take up the matter today. `` It would look better if he had shown up on time, but there's hope,'' said <PERSON> Ruffin </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> Monday's hearing was scheduled to decide if <PERSON> Ruffin </PERSON> should undergo drug treatment instead of serving a jail sentence. <PERSON> Ruffin </PERSON>, 48, was convicted in May 1988 of misdemeanor possession of cocaine. His sentence included two years' probation, 50 days of community service and drug testing and treatment. A drug test last week was positive for opiates, <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ruffin </PERSON> was arrested Sept. 16, the third time this year he has been in court for probation violations. Last week, <PERSON> Ruffin </PERSON> denied he had a drug problem, then admitted it later.

 Eleven British and Australian mercenaries, experts in assassination and explosives, spent three months in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> schooling private soldiers of cocaine barons in sophisticated weaponry, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported. The network, on `` NBC Nightly News'' Monday, broadcast videotape of what it said were the highly paid mercenaries training the drug troops and later counting their $ 20,000 pay _ delivered in American ten-dollar bills _ in a <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> hotel room. The footage was taken by one of the mercenaries, Australian <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tagney </PERSON>, and smuggled out out of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> reported.

The government has since confiscated the island. The mercenaries, led by a former British special forces sergeant major, were shown teaching classes in how to fire a rifle grenade launcher and how to set up grenade booby traps at cocaine processing labs to stop drug agents, according to the tape. NBC News paid <PERSON> Tagney </PERSON> for his videotape, said an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> McQuay </PERSON>. She declined to say how much. The network on Aug. 21 broadcast video footage of what it said were Israelis teaching the drug soldiers.

 <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, the city's first black police commissioner, has resigned after almost six years, leaving a legacy of innovation despite budget constraints, a tough war on drugs and his own verbal gaffes. `` I'm not always right,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> once said, `` but I'm never dull.'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, 63, cited chronic asthma in a resignation letter sent Monday to Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>. His departure is effective Oct. 22. During <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s time in office, crime rates soared and city streets got more violent, fueled by crack. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said combating the drug war was his `` highest priority from the start,'' noting that the Narcotics Division grew almost five-fold during his term, which began Jan. 1, 1984. He also created Tactical Narcotics Teams that are deployed to crack-ridden neighborhoods. But, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> added in his letter, `` I must acknowledge that the greatest problem when I came in is even more serious as I depart. ... The plague of illegal drugs that has wreaked such tragedy, violence and crime.'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, who called <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> `` one of the greatest police commissioners that ever served,'' appointed First Deputy Commissioner <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> _ <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s own choice _ as commissioner. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, who lost his bid for re-election in September's Democratic primary to <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Borough President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, leaves office at the end of the year. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> indicated before the primary that he wanted to resign but waited at the mayor's request. He said <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> would return to private life, but would not elaborate. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> has been working since June on his memoirs, tentatively titled `` Cop,'' to be published next fall. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> ran afoul of some black groups in July 1987 when he called black crime against blacks `` our little dirty secret.'' The next month, he apologized publicly for saying to a woman who spoke at a town meeting about being afraid of rapists: `` You're out here tonight. You ca n't be too frightened. You're the kind he's looking for, under 30, beautiful, blonde. In apologizing for what he called that `` insensitive'' remark, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said the woman had been heckling him and that he had taken asthma medication that `` may hype me up.'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> joined the force in 1951 as the first black police officer in a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> precinct. `` I think they were surprised to see me,'' he recalled in 1984. `` I had an Irish name, and I came from a predominantly white veterans' housing project in <LOCATION> Bath </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, but when they saw me, they developed a sudden shortage of lockers at the precinct house.'' By the time he was through, the positions he held included detective, head of the internal legal department, commissioner for community affairs, city traffic commissioner, state correction commissioner, chief of the city housing police and city correction commissioner. The commissioner oversaw a department with 26,790 officers. In resigning, he noted that it had grown by 2,129 officers during his tenure and that the number of black officers rose 17 percent, <ORGANIZATION> Hispanics </ORGANIZATION> 60 percent and women 85 percent. The uniformed force now is 11 percent black, 11.5 percent Hispanic and 12.4 percent female, he said. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> also cited increased educational requirements for certain ranks, a `` stronger stand'' on domestic violence and a program to put officers back on foot patrol in all 75 precincts.

<HEAD>Utah Teachers Stage Walkout to Protest Funding Woes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PEG McENTEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Twenty-thousand teachers were returning to classes today following a one-day walkout, but pledged to maintain pressure for greater funding for a crowded school system that ranks last in per-pupil expenditures. `` We will keep the pressure on,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>. The walkout gave 435,000 children an unexpected holiday when all but two of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s 40 school districts were closed down Monday. The strike was incited by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s decision during a special session last week to give residents a $ 38.4 million tax rebate, and not to allocate money to education from a $ 94 million surplus. The walkout began with a wildcat strike Friday morning at <ORGANIZATION> Davis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Davis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, just north of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and spread to schools in three other large school districts by the end of the day. Republican Gov. <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON> and the Republican-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, who drew the wrath of teachers as they previously drew the ire of taxpayers for a record tax hike two years ago, pledged money would be found for education during the regular legislative session, which begins in January. With a population of 1.7 million, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> has the largest average household size at 3.17, compared with the national average of 2.62. Nearly 70 percent of its residents are members of the <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which encourages large families, and the state has the nation's highest percentage of school-age children, with 37 percent under 18. With a student-teacher ratio of 25.4 to 1, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> also has the most overcrowded classrooms, and at $ 22,621 a year its teachers earn smaller salaries than educators in 43 other states, according to the union. The state ranks 50th in the average annual expenditure per student of $ 2,326, according to the union. Years of budget cuts have produced increasing complaints about outdated textbooks and inadequate supplies, with many teachers saying they've had to pay hundreds of dollars out of their own pockets to provide basic supplies. `` We've had truck drivers, steelworkers, housewives, retired workers and parents calling to say, ` It's about time,''' said <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, whose organization represents up to 90 percent of the state's teachers. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Chase </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, assured more than 3,000 teachers gathered at <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> on Monday that they had the support of some 2 million teachers for their `` courageous act of conscience.'' <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON> defended the tax cut. `` You have to remember I was the one who raised taxes two years ago,'' he said. That record tax hike sparked tax-slashing initiatives that were defeated by nearly a 2-to-1 margin in November's election, but the governor and legislative leaders decided to cut taxes when an economic resurgence brought the budget surplus. The governor has said teachers should have waited until the regular legislative session to press their demands, but he acknowledged the walkout got attention. `` There is a perception out there that all of the money has been given back. It has n't,'' <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON> said. `` After the tax cut that was passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, we still have a $ 55 million surplus this year and $ 100 million from the last two years.'' He said education would be treated `` honorably and honestly'' in January.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

 The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s key index closed at a new high today after its second-largest one-day gain this year, while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar fell marginally against the Japanese yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 484.11 points, or 1.38 percent, closing at 35,444.82. The previous record close was 35,140.83 on Aug. 21. Tuesday's gain was the largest since a 793.96-point rise March 28. The Nikkei had climbed 188.92 points Monday. The dollar closed at 142.80 yen, down 0.15 yen from its finish of 142.95 yen on Monday, when it fell 2.05 yen. It opened today at 142.25 yen and moved between 142.10 yen and 143.15 yen. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> Vice Governor <PERSON> Yasushi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyeno </PERSON> told reporters today that the trend is toward a lower dollar and higher yen after the `` Group of Seven'' industrialized nations agreed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Saturday to cooperate in foreign exchange markets to stem the dollar's recent rise. He said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s central bank would continue taking appropriate measures, keeping close contact with other G-7 nations. Another Bank of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> official said the central bank would prefer the dollar to decline to its levels of `` six months ago.'' At that time, the dollar was trading at about 132 yen. The <ORGANIZATION> G-7 </ORGANIZATION> statement said, `` A rise of the dollar above currents levels or an excessive decline could affect adversely prospects for the world economy.'' <PERSON> Minori </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeuchi </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> intervened intermittently today, selling small amounts of dollars to halt a new upswing, but the amount of selling was unknown. The central bank does not comment on its money market activities. `` For a while, the dollar is unlikely to rise back much because the <ORGANIZATION> G-7 </ORGANIZATION> central banks will coordinate intervention actively,'' Ms. <PERSON> Takeuchi </PERSON> added. On the stock exchange, dealers said the index rose mainly because investors were reassured by the yen's recovery against the dollar. <PERSON> Kazuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nomura </PERSON>, a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said investors bought aggressively because today was the actual first day of a new financial year for most businesses. The new business year starts Oct. 1 for most Japanese companies, but stock transactions for the next business year start five days earlier, <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> explained. Investment trust companies were aggressive buyers today, mainly purchasing high-tech, financial and electric power company issues, <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> said. Trading was moderate, with first section volume estimated at 900 million shares, a large increase from Monday's 550 million.

 Newspapers in cities pummeled by Hurricane Hugo found the storm was a journalist's dream and a publisher's nightmare as they labored to get out the big story without power, water or passable roads Most papers in the storm's path through <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> managed to keep printing, but it was n't easy. In <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, The State newspaper temporarily housed two other papers. The staff of the <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> papers did n't go home for several nights. In <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, The Sun News staff used portable toilets because the city sewers were out of commission. `` We got the paper out -LRB- Friday -RRB- and have been doing it ever since,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, an editor at The News and Courier and The Evening Post in hard-hit <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. `` A couple of nights everyone slept on the floor at the newspaper,'' <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> said. `` We did n't smell too good.'' The newspaper's emergency generator provided enough electricity to run the printing press, computers and a few lights, but the staff was still without running water Monday. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> struck <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> late Thursday, killing at least 17 people and leaving more than $ 3 billion in damage. Some papers were able to gather and print the information their readers needed to cope during the storm's aftermath, but could n't manage delivery In <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION>, 10-foot waves lapped up against the windows of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. Two delivery vans were swallowed up, and employees delivered the paper in their own cars. Saturday's paper was delayed one day because the newspaper building was blacked out Friday. The storm was `` a journalist's dream, but at the same time a nightmare,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkman </PERSON>, publisher of the thrice-weekly. The copy editing staff of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> was sent 140 miles to <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> to work on Friday and Saturday editions at The State, a sister newspaper. Deadlines were moved up, but carriers still were n't able to deliver to all subscribers because some roads were inaccessible. To conserve water, Publisher <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Pate </PERSON> ordered some unusual equipment for the office. `` We had to bring in porta-potties,'' he said. The State newspaper had to restart its presses a few times because of power fluctuations, managing editor <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitt </PERSON> said. The paper also housed some members of The Sun News staff and helped the <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> paper paste up its pages. The Item in Sumter could n't publish Friday or Saturday because the power was off and no generators were available, managing editor <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Osteen </PERSON> said. `` Everyone was totally immobilized. We could n't even get out of town to produce a paper,'' he said. The staff printed its Sunday and Monday papers at <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and Democrat, 85 miles away in <LOCATION> Orangeburg </LOCATION>. `` The response we've been getting is people were unbelievably grateful to get a paper'' Sunday, <PERSON> Osteen </PERSON> said. `` They've had very little information.'' Most radio and television stations in the area were off the air for a few days following the storm. The Island Packet in <LOCATION> Hilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Head </LOCATION>, which is printed at The <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION>, had problems getting carriers to deliver its Friday edition because the island had been evacuated. Then again, `` we had no one to deliver it to Friday morning,'' editor <PERSON> Fran </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, the prep-school student who strangled an 18-year-old woman in Central Park, was not allowed to watch a TV movie about the case because he was caught twice with marijuana in jail, officials said.

<HEAD>Sandinistas, Opposition Gird For Electoral Battle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In an electoral battle between the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and their U.S.-supported opponents, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> showed superior organization at a convention replete with balloons, whistles and bells. A gathering of 1,746 delegates nominated President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> on Sunday as the candidate of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for what may become the most hotly contested election in Nicaraguan history on Feb. 25. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have an apparent victory under their belts in a long war against Contra rebels. Opposition assets include an economy in disarray and a well-known candidate, <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrios </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, widow of a hero of the revolution that toppled dictator <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> in 1979. But the opposition is also a shaky coalition of 14 parties that range from Communist to conservative. Their bitter closed-door nomination meeting contrasted sharply with the lively Sandinista convention. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> promised fair elections in return for a Central American agreement to disband the U.S.-supported Contras by early December. While that date might not be met, it appears that the end of the war is in sight. `` The war against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government is paralyzed because of the peace accords,'' said <PERSON> Wycliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Diego </PERSON>, leader of a major <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> resistance group from eastern <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> became the latest leader to drop out of the armed resistance when he said Monday that he would return to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> this week to investigate setting up a political party and supporting Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>. But while the electoral process seems to be drawing in the opposition and weakening the armed resistance, the Sandinista platform slogan, `` Everything Will Be Better,'' exposed a crack in an otherwise slick surface. The slogan is a reminder, if any were needed, that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s economy has gone steadily downhill, to the point that it rivals <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> as the poorest nation in the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> In an effort to control hyperinflation, the government has had to implement an austerity program that left thousands jobless. The Sandinistas blame their problems on the war and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic boycott, but promises of better times ahead are being met with skepticism by voters who must struggle daily to make ends meet with less money, higher prices and food shortages. It was no surprise that <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> were renominated; they have worked together smoothly in the past. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> is the tough, firebrand ex-guerrilla who does n't miss a chance to bait the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, while <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> is the cool, moderate-toned, polished intellectual. In his acceptance speech, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> predicted the Sandinista would win and that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` will have to accept an understanding with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has already given signs of accommodation; recently a top <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official visited <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and met with <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, the first time that has happened in years. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> knows that winning <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> acceptance, however reluctant, is probably vital to economic recovery, but also that this depends on his party winning the elections cleanly. The Sandinistas are intent on having the vote declared free and fair and have invited international observers including former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who monitored <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s presidential election in May and called it a fraud. In an editorial, Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>'s newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s speech showed the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> were depending on `` sterile anti-Americanism'' and did not have a vision of the future to sell the electorate. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is trying to devise a way to assist <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s fledgling democratic process without providing direct support to the opposition. A figure of $ 9 million has been mentioned by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressional sources; that would be more than $ 4 for each of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s 1.9 million voters, but there are no signs of any big money yet. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> has already called on its organizations, which cover every neighborhood in the country, to begin house-to-house campaigning, using the threat of a super-financed opposition for motivation. The well-planned Sandinista convention, to which the press and the diplomatic corps were invited, contrasted sharply with tense deliberations of the political parties comprising the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> UNO </ORGANIZATION>, as it is known for its Spanish initials, chose <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON> as Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>'s running mate three weeks ago, but the choice almost split the coalition. The choice was considered important because many view Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> as a figurehead. Conservatives supported businessman <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolanos </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON>'s supporters said <PERSON> Bolanos </PERSON> would tilt the ticket too far to the right.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Floody </PERSON>, the captured fighter pilot who engineered the tunnel through which 76 Allied officers fled from a Nazi prison in a story portrayed in the film The Great Escape, has died at age 71. <PERSON> Floody </PERSON> died in a hospital Monday after a lengthy illness. `` He had chronic lung disease, partially due to the tunneling he did during the war,'' said his son <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>. `` It only got severe during the past several years.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officer, <PERSON> Floody </PERSON> used the mining experience he gained in <LOCATION> Kirkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, Ont., to engineer and dig the 350-foot tunnel out of <PERSON> Stalag </PERSON> <PERSON> Luft </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> Of the 76 Allied officers who fled the camp on March 24, 1944, only three eventually made good their escape. At least 50 of those recaptured _ six of them Canadian _ were executed. <PERSON> Floody </PERSON> was moved to another camp just before the escape. `` Every time I tell my wife I might have been one of the prisoners who got away, she reminds me: ` Yes, but you might have been one of the ones they shot,''' he said in a 1986 interview. The mass breakout was the subject of the 1963 movie The Great Escape, starring <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> McQueen </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Floody </PERSON> was a technical advisor for the film. <PERSON> Floody </PERSON> was 23 when his <ORGANIZATION> Spitfire </ORGANIZATION> was shot down over <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1941. He often served as the lead digger and passed buckets of the sandy gravel back to a brigade of men working in the tunnels, which were named <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>. The gravel was hidden in the camp's gardens. <PERSON> Floody </PERSON> became trapped several times in cave-ins and had to be pulled out by his heels. The Germans eventually discovered <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> was abandoned and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> became the escape route. About 600 of the 1,500 officers in the camp helped dig the tunnels but it was Floody who designed the lighting, ventilation and electrical systems. `` <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> was living Canadian history,'' <PERSON> Clem </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON>, another Canadian flyer who spent time in Stalag III, said Monday. `` He always kept on fighting, and other men took inspiration from that. Whenever veterans got together, <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> was a center of attention because of his fame as the Tunnel King,'' <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON> said. Floody remained in prison camps until the war ended. The <LOCATION> Chatham </LOCATION>, Ont., native returned to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and began his business career in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> He also helped found the <ORGANIZATION> RCAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisoner-of-War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Three Arrested For Allegedly Holding Woman in Slavery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AZUSA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three people accused of kidnapping a Guatemalan woman and keeping her enslaved for a year through torture and rape have been arrested, authorities said. Two women, ages 28 and 32, and a man, 37, were arrested Monday night after an informant's tip sent detectives to a camper truck that matched the description of the one where the victim was chained each night, said sheriff's Lt. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>. The woman escaped Sept. 2 by stealing keys from her sleeping captors. `` She tried to escape once before but was beaten,'' said police Detective <PERSON> Delia </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. The 27-year-old woman told police she was kidnapped July 15, 1988, when a woman approached her at a bus stop and lured her into the camper with the promise of a job. She was raped, tortured with electrical shocks and forced to cook and clean for a man, two women and five children, police said. At night, she was chained in the camper outside the group's home. Six children, ranging in age from infancy to 8 or 9 years old, were taken into protective custody at the time of the arrests, <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said. Authorities withheld the names of the adults booked by <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police for investigation of kidnapping, he said. Police said they do not doubt the victim's story. `` When I first read the report I said, ` Aw, come on, these things do n't happen,''' said police Detective <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Heidesch </PERSON>. `` But several of us talked to the victim independently, a counselor talked to her and everyone is convinced she is telling the truth.''

 Ten years ago, <PERSON> Linh </PERSON> <PERSON> Trang </PERSON> was one of the first Vietnamese soldiers to enter <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in a surprise invasion that toppled the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> government in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>. `` It was hell in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, 10 years of it,'' said <PERSON> Trang </PERSON>, 33, who commanded a battallion in the guerrilla-infested jungles of western <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. `` I'm just glad to be going home.'' This morning, those 10 years in hell ended as <PERSON> Trang </PERSON> and 10,000 other troops marched home through the gates of this sleepy border town. Up and down the border, Vietnamese troops are coming home in what the <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> government says is the withdrawal of its last 26,000 troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Returning by ship, ferry, truck and on foot, the soldiers faced a government-orchestrated hero's welcome today but an uncertain future. Like many of his comrades, <PERSON> Trang </PERSON> was stricken by malaria during the war. He also said he's lost 15 pounds, which means a lot to his small frame. But, he said, none of his health problems concern him. What is important now is to find a job. Last week, the chief spokesman of the <ORGANIZATION> Vietnamese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> would demobilize an unspecificied number of solidiers after its war with <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Major Gen. <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Thai </PERSON> said returning veterans would be given preference in finding work and economic assistance if they had difficulties. But many wonder whether <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, which is one of the poorest countries in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and already faces an unemployment crisis, will be able to provide jobs for the returning soldiers. `` I am not a young man,'' said <PERSON> Trang </PERSON>, `` so I do n't think I can return to school. I want to work in textiles, maybe as a tailor. Before I entered the army I was a tailor in <LOCATION> Ho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.'' Still, he said, nothing had been settled. <PERSON> Luon </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dang </PERSON> is a little more sure about what he wants to do but just as worried. The 23-year-old from Can <PERSON> Tho </PERSON> province says he will try to stay in the armed forces, his home for the last five years. `` I like a soldier's life,'' he said as he squatted in the buffer zone between <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` I lost my family during the Vietnam War so the army is my family. They feed me and clothe me. I believe in them.'' <PERSON> Dang </PERSON> said he hoped he would not be demobilized. `` My officers know I love the Vietnamese Army,'' he said, `` but after I walk through the gate to my country over there everything could change.'' <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> has demobilized more than a half-million soldiers in recent years, Gen. <PERSON> Tran </PERSON> <PERSON> Cong </PERSON> <PERSON> Man </PERSON>, editor of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s official army newspaper, said in a recent interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He said the armed forces' manpower peak was 1.5 million in 1979, 50,000 were demobilized between 1982 and 1987, and over the past two years <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> had released 500,000. Some soldiers said they will miss <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Earlier last week, at a good-bye ceremony at <LOCATION> Pursat </LOCATION>, a provincial <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> capital, <PERSON> Cao </PERSON> <PERSON> Viet </PERSON> sat weeping in the corner as he hugged a Cambodian brother-in-arms. `` We are very close to the people in the countryside,'' said the Vietnamese officer who spent six years in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and speaks good Khmer. `` We died for these people and they know it. I will never forget the people here.'' Behind him, a Cambodian cultural troupe played salsa music. Vietnamese soldiers danced with <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> women. Bottles of Western scotch were passed from hand to hand. Fighting in the jungles was difficult, <PERSON> Viet </PERSON> said. Lack of transportation makes for shortages of drinking water and food. Many nights he and his men went hungry, he said. `` A guerrilla enemy is very hard to destroy,'' <PERSON> Viet </PERSON> said. `` They would attack and then disperse and chasing them with difficult.'' The Vietnamese Army began as a guerrilla force when it battled the French and American armies but it used more traditional methods in fighting its war in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Viet </PERSON> said he saw no irony in this. `` We were the liberators of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` We did what we had to do.''

<HEAD>Inmates Angered Over Columns Missing From Prison Newspaper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> has decided to stop publishing stories on legal issues in the prison system's monthly newspaper, angering inmates who say it was the most popular feature in the paper `` Several months ago, they told me there would be no more articles on legal issues generally,'' said <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Marble </PERSON>, an inmate who has been editor of The Echo for the past four years. `` That's probably the most-read part of the paper, and it's definitely the part we got the most complaints about if it was n't there. The legal section of the newspaper included a column by the corrections department's staff counsel, articles by inmates discussing recent court decisions and reprints of `` free world'' stories that address penal issues, Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyer </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported. Corrections department Deputy Director <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> denied Monday that he has banned law-related stories, but said the articles on legal issues often were inaccurate. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said he prefers to devote space to describing prison services available to inmates to prepare them for the real world. `` I'm not going to do any free advertising for lawyers, and I'm not going to teach people how to sue,'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said `` But we will do articles on things like the services provided for inmates by the inmate attorney.'' Staff attorney <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON>, whose state-supported office offers legal advice to inmates, said he had completed columns for the May and June issues when word came they would n't be used. <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said a column on the Open Records Act might have displeased a corrections department board member. The legal issues column addressed such subjects as the consequences of filing frivolous appeals and changes in such matters as deadly weapons findings by juries and whether notaries are needed for certain legal documents. Marble said several inmates have indicated they plan to file suit over the format change. `` I get sued every day and I'm sure I'll get sued over this,'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said. `` It's part of my job.''

 <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance groups claim tens of thousands of Vietnamese troops have disguised themselves as Cambodians and will remain in the country despite <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s claims of a total troop withdrawal. The resistance charge is emerging as its central argument to justify an escalation of the war in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, despite the absence of any hard evidence of a large-scale plan by the Vietnamese army to remain in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> said the last of its forces will be out of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, which it invaded in late 1978, by midnight today. But officials of all three major resistance groups characterize the pullout as an elaborate hoax. `` The Vietnamese will not withdraw from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>,'' said Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Rannaridth </PERSON> in a recent interview. `` We are not fighting a civil war. It will remain a war to liberate <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> from Vietnamese occupation.'' The prince leads the army loyal to his father, Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, who heads a loose coalition which also includes the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and the non-communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. The Sihanoukists charge that more than 30,000 Vietnamese have already been disguised as troops or militia of the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government or as Vietnamese civilians living in the country. Others are operating in remote areas as regular Vietnamese troops, they claim. <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> radio claimed in a recent broadcast that the number of disguised Vietnamese troops is 110,000. While the resistance and defectors fleeing to the Thai-Cambodian border often cite specific units and figures where the subterfuge is supposedly occurring, Western analysts following developments in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> are still uncertain. `` I have heard many reports of Vietnamese disguised as Phnom Penh troops, but we can not confirm anything,'' one analyst said. `` I am not saying it is n't happening but we have no proof.'' `` All they -LRB- the resistance -RRB- need is one piece of hard evidence, one captured document or officer,'' said another <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> watcher. `` But until then nobody will believe them. Nobody except Cambodians, who are always ready to believe in the worst intentions of the Vietnamese.'' <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> experts point out that a total Vietnamese pullout would greatly undermine the resistance battle cry that they are fighting their historic enemies, the Vietnamese, and preventing them from `` swallowing the country.'' But should there be truth in the resistance claims, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> would jeopardize its sorely needed economic assistance from non-communist nations which have shunned it since the invasion. <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> hopes the withdrawal will end its isolation. The resistance groups say disguised Vietnamese units are used only to support government troops who are faring poorly in combat against their fighters. `` The Vietnamese are in -LRB- <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> Prime Minister -RRB- Hun Sen uniforms. I have seen many of them,'' said 25-year-old <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Souen </PERSON>, a defector from the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> army. `` In my unit there were six Vietnamese experts. They are in <LOCATION> Hun </LOCATION> Sen uniforms like me. Before they were in Vietnamese uniforms, but three months ago they switched.'' The chief military analyst of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, Dr. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaffar </PERSON>, said a number of disguised Vietnamese were fighting in <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> troops are reportedly locked in fierce battle for the gem-rich, Thai-Cambodian border town. <PERSON> Gaffar </PERSON> said two regiments of <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s 330th Division had been integrated into Phnom Penh's 92nd Division while three other Vietnamese regiments had shed their own uniforms. The resistance also points to Vietnamese civilians living in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> as proof of <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s intention to colonize their country. It places the number of these settlers at 1.25 million. Vietnamese officials say there are only 80,000 while some Western diplomats estimate 200,000. Most are shopkeepers, skilled workers and fishermen. Many have left or are leaving, fearing for their safety after the Vietnamese military shield is withdrawn.

<HEAD>Quebec Re-elects Liberals; English Speakers Register Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> governing <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> retained its majority over a steady challenge from the separatist <LOCATION> Parti </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quebecois </LOCATION> and a surprising protest vote from the province's English-speaking minority Results of Monday's vote in the largest and second most populous Canadian province showed the Liberals led by Premier <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON> with 92 seats in the 125-seat provincial assembly. The <PERSON> Parti </PERSON> <PERSON> Quebecois </PERSON> won 29 seats, a gain of six, and a new <ORGANIZATION> Equality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> captured four in traditional Liberal strongholds. `` I believe that this is a sign of confidence,'' a smiling <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON>, whose early hopes for a calm campaign capitalizing on four years of continuing prosperity in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s largest province had been dashed by environmental protests and labor unrest, said at his district headquarters. The Parti Quebecois had been reeling from its provincial election debacle four years ago in which it lost power to <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON> and fell to only 23 of the then-122 seat assembly. <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Parizeau </PERSON>, who won an internal party battle to put it back on a hard-line course last year, ran a strong campaign on a platform of eventual independence for the majority French-speaking province. `` We have progressed solidly toward the goal that we think is the right one,'' <PERSON> Parizeau </PERSON> said Monday night in reiterating his separatist aims. Supporters chanted `` Le <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> aux Quebecois,'' or `` Quebec for Quebecers.'' The Equality Party was formed by English speakers irate over <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>'s language policies that still restrict all outdoor signs to French. Supporters at party headquarters sang `` O <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>,'' the national anthem, at their victory celebration. `` I have never been so proud to be a Canadian and a Quebecois in my life,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Libman </PERSON>, 29-year-old architect who formed the <ORGANIZATION> Equality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> just months ago. <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON>, an economist, counted on Quebecers being more interested in pragmatic issues related to prosperity than to independence. He pointed to a 4 percent annual economic growth rate, the creation of 233,000 new jobs and the social stability that lasted most of his term. But the idea of separatism for <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, thought to have been put to rest in a 1980 referendum in which 60 percent of the voters rebuffed it, held on to its current of support. The Parti Quebecois won 38.7 percent of the popular vote in the December 1985 provincial election. Projections were that it had increased slightly to 40 percent Monday. <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON>'s support among <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>'s English-speaking minority, which traditionally had voted Liberal, was hurt by his refusal in December to allow more than a token change in provincial laws restricting commercial signs to the French language. His compromise solution allowed bilingual signs only indoors as long as the French-language portion was significantly larger than the English. <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, which has a population of 6.5 million, is 81 percent French-speaking. Supporters of language restrictions argue they are necessary to protect French and <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>'s special culture surrounded by English elsewhere in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Those who oppose the restrictions say they violate basic rights. <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON>'s term before the language uproar last winter was unusually quiet as <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> settled into a period of strong economic growth, leading to speculation that the Parti Quebecois could be facing its last days. The separatist party had controlled the provincial government from 1976, at the height of the period when power in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> shifted from the English-speaking minority to the French majority, to their defeat in 1985. Monday's victory confirmed the comeback by <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON>, whose colorless style could almost be considered a trademark. He was the youngest premier ever elected in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> when he won the 1970 election at the age of 36, but the <LOCATION> Parti </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quebecois </LOCATION> then ousted him six years later at the height of separatist sentiment.

<TEXT>
 The office of a newspaper that has been criticized for running photographs of a man electrocuted in an accident was rammed by a bus spray-painted with messages demanding respect for the dead man. Police questioned a man whose wallet was found under the bus that crashed into the lobby of The <ORGANIZATION> Mesa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> early Monday. The man, whose surname is the same as the dead man's, refused to cooperate, said police spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>. No one was injured in the incident. The Tribune printed two color photos last week with a brief story on the death of <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, 25, who was killed Sept. 18 when he touched a power line while trimming a palm tree. The newspaper ran one photo showing <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>'s legs as paramedics lowered him from the tree. The other photo showed a relative leaning against an ambulance, hyperventilating, after seeing <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> die. <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>'s friends and relatives flooded the paper with angry calls and letters about the photos. An anonymous caller to <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> television station <ORGANIZATION> KTSP </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for ramming the building because the newspaper `` disgraced'' <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Morse </PERSON>, a morning producer. The wallet found at the scene led police to <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, 33, <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said. Officers also found a bill of sale for the bus made out to <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, though it was still registered to another man, <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said. Police were unsure of the relationship between <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> and the dead man, <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said. The 1956 school bus was spray-painted with `` We love you <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>, rest in peace,'' and `` We demand respect for <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> publisher <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Laosa </PERSON> said the decision to publish the photos was like `` any other decision that our editors have to make on a daily basis.'' <PERSON> Laosa </PERSON> added: `` They think it and rethink it and make a decision to run or not run it. We will continue to make those kinds of judgments as the situations present themselves. I wish there was an easy answer.''

 Singer <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> is suing his former manager for $ 90 million, alleging that he stole millions of dollars and lost millions more in risky investments such as horsebreeding. The suit was filed Monday, the day after <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> was hospitalized with severe abdominal pain from kidney stones, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The pain struck <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> as he waited Sunday afternoon at <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> for a Concorde supersonic flight to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Marks </PERSON>.

Marks would not disclose the name of the hospital. `` He's in this country and he's OK _ that's all I can tell you,'' he said. The lawsuit was filed in state court against <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, who was fired Aug. 30, after an audit uncovered the alleged thefts, <PERSON> Marks </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> also was <PERSON> Joel </PERSON>'s former brother-in-law.

 `` The Satanic Verses'' is one novel that shook the world. But one year and 1.1 million hardback copies after it was released, the factors publishers weigh in deciding what to print remain the same, experts say. `` The book was one of a kind _ I mean it was a fictional fantasy that happened to affect large numbers of people and particularly people in positions of power, and I think that's a very unlikely thing to be repeated right now,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, editor-in-chief of Publisher's Weekly, a trade magazine. <ORGANIZATION> Viking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penguin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> published the book a year ago. Five months later, on Feb. 14, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> fixed the world's attention on it when he put a $ 5.2 million bounty on the life of its Moslem author, <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> also urged Moslems to kill his publishers. The book, which most Moslem countries banned because they said it blasphemed <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>, plunged <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> into a confrontation with the West. Viking Penguin says its decision to publish the book was not influenced by its potentially inflamatory content. `` We certainly did n't buy ` The Satanic Verses' because we thought it would be controversial. We bought it because we think <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> is one of the most distinguished authors of the late 20th century,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Slovak </PERSON>, a spokesman at the publishing house. Slovak declined Monday to disclose sales or profit figures for the book. But he added that despite the huge sales, <PERSON> Viking </PERSON> <PERSON> Penguin </PERSON> may just about break even because of costly security measures it was forced to take. `` We ca n't let our guard down completely even now,'' he said. On Sunday, a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper reported that a paperback edition of the book would come out this winter but that the exact date was being kept secret for security reasons. Earlier, there were reports that plans for a paperback edition had been shelved for fear of more violence. The book's hardback release in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> on Sept. 22, 1988, led to a series of bookstore bombings and other troubles, including the refusal of some stores to stock it out of fear for their safety. `` The Satanic Verses'' first appeared in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stores in January, though it was n't officially released in this country until Feb. 22. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> journalism professor, said the determining factor among book publishers in deciding what books to offer is profitability, not whether it will be controversial. `` The notion of publishing a book because it is critical of government or some group _ Palestinians, Moslems, or Jews _ and banking on that and the publicity that may come from it is much too speculative a strategy for people who are basically kind of accountants,'' <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said. And <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Schuster, said: `` People assume a lot of the time publishers are n't publishing a book because they're worried about controversy _ in fact, they're making business decisions. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, who wrote a best-selling, controversial biography of former <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> oil minister <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamani </PERSON> published in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, said profit motivated Viking Penguin to print more copies of `` The Satanic Verses'' when demand skyrocketed. `` That's just fueling the fires,'' said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. `` I think most publishers would be very wary of getting involved with a book like that again `` But there will always be somebody.'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Entrekin </PERSON>, an independent publisher under the umbrella of <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monthly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` It gets very dangerous if you let yourself get censored a priori. I do n't go looking for trouble, but I try not to let it influence me too much.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayward </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Schuster </ORGANIZATION>'s trade division, said controversy should not factor into a book's rejection. `` I do n't think you can be selective; you've got to publish books that deserve to be published, otherwise that's where the self-censorship would begin and where would it end? `` Satanic Verses was such an extreme, there's no way to anticipate that type of outrageous reaction.'' But, he admitted, `` We sometimes buy controversial books to generate news.''

<TEXT>
 A fire in an ammunition depot sent a cascade of artillery shells raining on a Siberian city, killing one person and forcing the evacuation of 20,000 residents, <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> and a newspaper said today. <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said the shelling of <LOCATION> Yurga </LOCATION>, 1,500 miles east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, began Thursday night after acetone stored in a munitions warehouse caught fire and exploded. `` Shells started flying in every direction,'' the newspaper said. It said the force of the explosion hurled some shells into fields and forests and others into the nearby city. None of the shells exploded. One soldier died and several civil defense workers were injured in the blast, the reports said. Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said, `` the Siberian city of <LOCATION> Yurga </LOCATION> suffered from a veritable shelling.'' It said the artillery shells demolished a private home, damaged the roof of a five-story office building and tore off the corner of a child-care center. The residents were evacuated because of fears that one of the shells might have landed in the chlorine gas storage area of a water-filtering plant and could possibly have exploded. Investigators said the danger had passed, but did not say whether the residents had returned, <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said.

 A physician, free after two years in jail for refusing to let her daughter visit her former husband, says she realizes she could wind up back behind bars in her bitter child custody battle. `` I do n't know that anything is over,'' Dr. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said shortly after she was released Monday from the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> jail. `` I could be jailed again, and I know that, and my daughter remains unprotected.'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, 41, was jailed on civil contempt of court charges in August 1987 after failing to produce her 7-year-old daughter <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON> for court-ordered visits with Dr. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON>, her ex-husband and the girl's father. She has alleged that <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON> sexually abused <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON>; <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON> has repeatedly denied those charges. Her release was the result of a law passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and signed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last week limiting civil contempt jail terms in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> to 12 months. The law expires after 18 months. Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, who sponsored the bill which resulted in her release, said today that <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> still could be charged with criminal contempt. `` So I suspect this case is not over,'' he said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' program. <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON>, appearing on the same program, said, `` I'm delighted that <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> is out of jail. I only wish this could be coupled with some concern for my missing daughter. I would have been in support of that bill if the bill had a provision mandating a government agency such as the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> be required to find my daughter.'' While <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> smiled during a news conference and held hands with her fiance, federal appeals court judge <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, she acknowledged that her legal fight is far from over. `` I intend to stay here and work through the legal system until -LRB- <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON> -RRB- is safe,'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said. `` I will never give up.'' `` I can not say where she is if there is a possibility she would be returned'' to <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON>, she said. <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mittleman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON>'s attorney, said after <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> was released that further proceedings against her are `` quite likely.'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> `` remains in contempt of court, and this law does n't change that,'' Ms. <PERSON> Mittleman </PERSON> said `` That's not being vengeful; it's just what the law is about.'' <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON>'s attorney maintained in court papers that the new law was unconstitutional because it infringed on the power of the judicial branch to enforce its orders. Ms. <PERSON> Mittleman </PERSON> also charged in her papers that the law violated several of <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON>'s constitutional rights, among them the right to due process of law. District Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Alprin </PERSON> signed the order freeing <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>. A cold, driving rain greeted her as she emerged from the jail, riding in a car accompanied by <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> and her attorney, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON>. `` I feel very happy and very grateful to everyone that has helped me,'' she said, wearing an orange prison jumpsuit and clutching a dozen yellow roses given her by <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>. `` I will probably cry when I say this, but I want to thank God for every angel on Earth who has helped me.'' Meeting reporters later after changing into a blue dress with white polka dots, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said she was `` stunned ... It's a bit like being born again.'' Refusing to disclose <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON>'s whereabouts, she said her daughter is better off than she was when <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> started the jail term. `` She's happy where she is,'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said. `` She's made a remarkable recovery. She obviously misses me, as I miss her, but she has no desire to return if it means further incest.'' Asked whether she had heard from her daughter during her two years behind bars, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> responded, `` Yes, but I wo n't tell you how'' and added, `` If I were going to my daughter I would not tell you.'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> was asked what the future holds and replied, `` I hope it does n't hold jail.'' She said she was going `` wherever my fiance will take me.'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> was asked what she would say if she could talk to her daughter. She paused, then said, `` You're a wonderful girl, and it was worth every minute ... I hope the last two years were just the beginning of a lifetime of safety.''

 Hurricane Hugo knocked out electricity and phones at <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, hastening the closing of much of the Christian theme park and retreat built by <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. `` We were planning to close the hotel anyhow. It was a cash drain,'' M.C. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, the bankruptcy trustee overseeing the property, said Monday. The 11-year-old, 2,200-acre park was shut down Friday after <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s assault. The Heritage Grand Hotel, full of charismatic Christians and curiosity-seekers before <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s downfall in a sex and money scandal, had been nearly empty in recent months. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned from the ministry in 1987 and <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> filed for bankruptcy. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> is on trial in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, on charges of defrauding followers by diverting nearly $ 4 million in donations to live in high style. Prosecutors said he oversold `` lifetime partnerships'' guaranteeing major contributors lodging at the Heritage Grand. <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> in its heyday drew millions of believers. In addition to <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, the attractions included the ornate hotel, a water park, shops, a TV studio and church and residential areas. Only the residential areas _ condominiums, houses and apartments _ remain open. <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> last week said he had withdrawn his offer of $ 65 million for <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>. He won court approval in December to buy the park but could not get the title insurance needed to close the deal because of a claim to the land from an Indian tribe. `` There are still a few interested players yet,'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said. `` I've gotten no written bid, but there has been expression of interest.''

<HEAD>Durable Goods Orders Rebound 3.8 Percent in August</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Orders for `` big ticket'' durable goods, boosted by robust automobile sales, rebounded a strong 3.8 percent in August for their steepest advance this year, the government said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said demand for durable goods, items expected to last more than three years, totaled a seasonally adjusted $ 126.7 billion, their biggest increase since a 7.4 percent advance last December. The August advance came after a bigger decline than previously thought in July. July orders fell 2.5 percent rather than the 1.9 percent originally reported. Orders had risen 1.3 percent in June. Durable goods orders, a bellweather of the economy's performance, have bounced up and down throughout the year, rising in March, April, June and August and falling in January, February, May and July Transportation equipment orders were up 6.7 percent to $ 36.3 billion as a large increase in motor vehicles and parts more than offset a decline in aircraft and parts. Transportation orders had risen 1.8 percent in July. Excluding the transportation category, durable goods orders were up 2.7 percent. Orders for non-electrical machinery, including computers and a wide variety of industrial equipment, increased 9.2 percent to $ 22.8 billion after a 10.4 percent decline in July. The closely watched non-defense capital goods sector fell 9.8 percent to $ 37.4 billion. Economists use this category as a barometer of business investment plans. Orders for both electrical machinery and primary metals, including steel, were down last month, the department said. Electrical machinery orders fell 0.9 percent to $ 19.6 billion, with communications equipment showing the largest decrease. Primary metals were off 1.9 percent to $ 11.3 billion. Excluding the defense category, which swings widely from month to month, orders rose 3.9 percent in August after falling 1.5 percent in July. Volatile military orders increased 1.9 percent to $ 7.8 billion after plunging 14.7 percent in July. Shipments of durable goods in August rose a record 9.5 percent to $ 128.4 billion, much of it reflecting automobiles. The previous high during the current seven-year economic expansion was a 4.5 percent increase in January 1983.

 The fire that killed two people and injured dozens aboard a huge <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> passenger ferry apparently was deliberately set, police said today. The 600-foot Tor <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION> was traveling from <LOCATION> Goteborg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Harwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, with 650 passengers and crew when the fire broke out at dawn Monday. The fire was put out within a few hours and the Danish ferry, owned by the shipping company Scandinavian Seaways, sailed under its own power to its home port, <LOCATION> Esbjerg </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Esbjerg </LOCATION> police inspector <PERSON> Herluf </PERSON> <PERSON> Mogensen </PERSON>, head of the investigation, said the fire started in a hall with linen closets, close to a staircase on a passenger deck in the bow. The staircase leads up to the radio room. <PERSON> Mogensen </PERSON> said electric failure had been excluded as a cause of the blaze. `` Theoretically a cigarette could have been accidentally dropped in one of the 10 trolleys standing in the hall with linen, but the violent development of the fire indicates it was helped and that it was deliberately set,'' <PERSON> Mogensen </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He said a crew member carried out a routine inspection 40 minutes before the fire started and found everything was normal. <PERSON> Mogensen </PERSON> declined to say if there were any suspects. A middle-aged Swedish couple was found dead in a cabin close to where the fire started. <PERSON> Mogensen </PERSON> said 35 persons suffering from smoke inhalation were treated in hospital. Shipping company officials said Monday that 10 were injured. Danish radio reported Monday night that about 50 were taken to hospital when the ferry reached <LOCATION> Esbjerg </LOCATION>. The reason for the discrepancies was not immediately explained.

<HEAD>Institute Fails To Duplicate Results of Fusion Experiments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Experiments at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION>'s new <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fusion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> have shown no sign of producing fusion, says the director of the research center `` We have a conference coming up here next February,'' said director <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossi </PERSON>. `` If we do n't have any papers to present, then this place will be closing up shop. I'm not saying I will do that. I'm just saying I think that is what would happen.'' The center was set up by the state after chemists <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> announced at the university in March that they had harnessed the energy source that powers the sun by achieving fusion at room temperature in a jar. <PERSON> Rossi </PERSON> said Monday the institute's more than 20 electrochemical cells, all variations of <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON>'s experiment, have produced no excess heat and no fusion products such as neutrons or tritium. `` It's gotten to be time for us to start wondering if we're doing anything wrong,'' said <PERSON> Rossi </PERSON> He called the situation `` unnerving.'' Scientists around the world have had difficulty duplicating <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON>'s experiments, which held out the possibility of a cheap, relatively safe and virtually inexhaustible supply of energy. Conventional nuclear energy, or fission, splits atoms; fusion produces energy by fusing them together. <PERSON> Rossi </PERSON> said the institute is negotiating with the <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Menlo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, for funding. The institute so far has only $ 4.3 million in state money to spend on research. Neither <PERSON> Rossi </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Kulhammer </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> EPRI </ORGANIZATION> vice president for exploratory research, would say how much money is involved. In another development, a scientist from the European laboratory <ORGANIZATION> CERN </ORGANIZATION> said that a worldwide examination of attempts to duplicate cold fusion shows there is little hope that it is real. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, a self-described student of `` pathological science,'' said that in most cases the experimenters found no effect or found something early on but could n't repeat it. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, a physicist at the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, was in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> last week to visit with <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> scientists. <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> were in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and are not expected to return until Thursday. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said cold fusion fits the mold of other wrong experiments in scientific history that appeared to hold huge promise. `` It is normal when you have a wonderful dream to accept the positive and suppress the negative,'' he said. `` Everyone does it. Scientists are human, too.'' <PERSON> Rossi </PERSON> said <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> `` gave his talk as if the book has been closed, and I think it's premature.''

<HEAD>Supreme Soviet Discusses Budget and Economic Reform</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads thruout to UPDATE with legislature today addressing whether
to put private businesses under more control; no pickup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 The Supreme Soviet today began a stormy debate on the future of small private businesses that President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> says are facing an ultimatum from Soviet consumers upset about price gouging. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> questioned why soap, for example, is sold by the businesses for as much as $ 9 when it should sell for $ 1.50 or less. `` We have to take into account the mood of the people,'' he told the legislature as it began debating proposed amendments that would decentralize control of private firms and give local governments more power to regulate them. The amendments were to be submitted to a legislative committee, but both opponents and supporters of the private businesses, called cooperatives, used the joint session to debate the enterprises' future The debate came a day after the Soviet government presented a `` crisis'' budget including a reduction in defense spending by more than 8 percent and measures to cut the budget deficit in half. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> initiated legislation that beginning in 1987 allowed individuals to set up small cooperative businesses to provide goods and services the government-run economy could not. He said he stands by cooperatives for the innovation and competition they can bring to the Soviet economy, but that price gouging and corruption must be controlled because of public outrage. Several groups, including trade union activists and a group of farmers who met with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> last weekend, are demanding a crackdown on cooperatives, which charge prices that are not regulated by the state. Deputy <PERSON> Veniamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Yarin </PERSON> of <PERSON> Nizhni </PERSON> <PERSON> Tagilsk </PERSON> said that cooperatives engage in `` open robbery of the working man.'' But Deputy <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobchak </PERSON>, head of the law school at <ORGANIZATION> Leningrad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said cooperatives in some areas were facing wholesale closure by local governments that were ignoring the law. Deputy Premier <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s closest economic advisers, presented the amendments and told the deputies that `` cooperatives are making the first step toward forming a socialist market, which we have been talking about for so long.'' <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON> said problems that cause public outrage with cooperatives actually are the problems of the entire Soviet economy, such as severe shortages of basic goods and services. He said Soviet society must recognize that cooperatives are an important part of the economy, agree to treat them equally with state-run business, and allow local governments to regulate them in order to take into account local needs and viewpoints. Finance Minister <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavlov </PERSON>, who presented the 1990 budget proposal on Monday, described the country's economic problems as a `` crisis.'' The Supreme Soviet's two-month session will consider about 80 bills aimed at altering some long-time tenets of Soviet politics. With a need to generate more revenues and cut expenses, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> plans to implement a progressive income tax for Soviets earning $ 1,076 a month _ more than three times the average worker's wage _ and float a $ 92 billion bond issue, the nation's first domestic offering, to help finance new construction, <PERSON> Pavlov </PERSON> told the lawmakers The 542-member bicameral Supreme Soviet, chaired by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, has reconvened at a time of widespread turmoil and discontent caused by the demands of various ethnic groups and by the state-run economy's failure to meet many Soviets' basic needs. The government's plan for the economy in 1990 calls for a one-fifth increase in factory-made consumer goods, according to Deputy Premier <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Voronin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pavlov </PERSON> said the government plan to cut military spending from $ 119 billion to $ 109 billion is in keeping with the directive from the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies to slash defense spending by 14 percent by 1991.

 Thousands of Vietnamese soldiers pulled out of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> today, rumbling across the border in aging trucks and buses in what <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> says is the end of its involvement in the decade-long war in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Led by officers riding in a U.S.-made jeep and a string of Soviet-made armored personnel carriers, the troops passed by thousands of schoolchildren waving flags along Highway 1. The narrow, potholed road was one of the main routes from which Vietnamese forces invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978 and ended nearly four years of <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> terror, installing a pro-Hanoi government. There is widespread fear that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, which from 1975 to 1978 sent hundreds of thousands of Cambodians to their death as it tried to turn the country into a primitive agrarian commune, could fight its way back to power. In a radio report received today, <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas said they captured two more positions in western <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and killed or wounded a number of Vietnamese soldiers. And in a message to his countrymen, <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Heng </PERSON> <PERSON> Samrin </PERSON> today appealed to the army, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the people to `` unite as a rock-like bloc'' to prevent the re-emergence of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Ho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> today, government officials said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> would renegotiate a `` peace and friendship'' treaty imposed on the Cambodian government soon after it was installed. The treaty, in essence a mutual defense pact, conflicts with <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s stated goal of neutrality. The officials said Vietnamese arms shipments, military advice and intelligence, will last as long as nations such as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> continue to support the guerrilla resistance front. Vietnamese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> today urged a halt to outside military support for <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s warring factions in order to avert a civil war. Vietnamese schools were closed to mark the troops' return, and relatives of soldiers ran across the border at <LOCATION> Moc </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bai </LOCATION>. `` I am so happy to be leaving <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>,'' said a soldier from Can <PERSON> Tho </PERSON> province as his 3-year-old daughter tugged at his hair. `` My wife is more beautiful now than ever,'' said another soldier as he held hands with his spouse. The young woman, dressed up in a skirt and blouse, had sprinted the last few yards to embrace her husband. In addition to the 10,000 troops crossing at <LOCATION> Moc </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bai </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> soldiers crossed over at port towns on the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and at several other locations overland. In all, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> said its last 26,000 troops were coming home today. Logistics and artillery divisions, along with wounded soldiers, crossed the border at <LOCATION> Samat </LOCATION>, several miles north of <LOCATION> Moc </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bai </LOCATION>. Tanks and armored personnel carriers arrived at the port town of <LOCATION> Rach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gai </LOCATION>. Outside of <PERSON> Moc </PERSON> <PERSON> Bai </PERSON>, villagers crowded around the trucks to cheer the soldiers. Many waved Vietnamese flags. Some threw flowers to the troops. `` Welcome home!,'' many people shouted. But many soldiers said they were worried about their future. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has said it will demobilize many after the withdrawal, and unemployment is high. For the past decade, tens of thousands of Vietnamese troops have been in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> helping the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government battle a coalition of guerrilla groups whose strongest faction is the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. Both the <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> governments hope the withdrawal will convince countries to end economic and diplomatic boycotts imposed after <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s invasion. <PERSON> Phnom </PERSON> <PERSON> Penh </PERSON>'s Premier <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> says he also hopes the pullout will persuade <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> to stop aiding the three guerrilla groups. `` After the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops the war will continue,'' <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> told reporters Sunday. `` As to the scope of the war, we think it will depend on foreign countries,'' he said. The guerrillas have called the troop withdrawal a sham, and say thousands of Vietnamese troops will remain, disguised as Cambodians. At a series of farewell ceremonies over the past six days in key provincial towns, Cambodians cheered the departing troops and praised the communist solidarity between the two neighboring countries. Some Cambodians said they welcomed the withdrawal, while others said they feared the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, which has been on the offensive as the Vietnamese withdraw. On Monday, in a report received today in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> radio claimed its forces had captured two more positions in the west, at <LOCATION> Peam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ta </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Toek </PERSON> <PERSON> Sok </PERSON>. The guerrillas also claim to have captured `` a major strategic position'' on the road between the key towns of <LOCATION> Battambang </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION> is the center of a remote ruby mining district near <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, where the guerrilla groups are based. Western diplomats do not normally consider <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> radio reports reliable sources of information. <PERSON> Phnom </PERSON> <PERSON> Penh </PERSON>'s defense minister, Gen. Tea Banh, has acknowledged the guerrillas have seized teritory near <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION>, but said the area remained under government control. <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> officials have repeatedly assured reporters that they are capable of fighting the guerrillas without Vietnamese military support, but concede that some <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> residents have begun stocking rice and other staples in anticipation of a cut-off of supplies to the capital. In 1975, <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> forces encircled the city, forcing the withdrawal of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> personnel on April 12 and the fall of the U.S-backed <ORGANIZATION> Lon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nol </ORGANIZATION> government five days later. In the decade since <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s invasion, the number of <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> troops has fallen from 170,000 to 17,000, Vietnamese army officials say.

 Moslem militia chieftains today criticized political reforms being considered by legislators and warned that the fighting in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war will continue. A 3-day-old truce, which halted six months of fighting between the <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> army and <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> leader Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces, was `` generally holding'' with no serious violations, police said. Sporadic sniper fire crackled along <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s dividing <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION>, but that has become a daily ritual. `` The military battle is not over yet and will not be finished on the basis of a new sectarian compromise contained in the committee's draft plan,'' declared <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>, leader of the Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Druse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. His remarks, published by the independent An-Nahar daily, reflected the hostility between <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s Moslem and leftist allies and the Christians who have long dominated <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s political system. Shiite Moslem militia chieftain <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> also criticized the proposed reforms, which aim to split power equally, saying they were `` not enough.'' `` The constitution which they want to change gives us more than the Arab committee's plan for reforms,'' he said. <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> did not elaborate. But he has been insisting that <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 1.2 millin-strong Shiites, the country's largest sect, should have a greater share of power than other sects. The remarks by <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> underlined the fragility of the cease-fire, brokered by an Arab League committee, that took effect Saturday. The truce was part of a seven-point peace plan forged by King Fahd of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> II of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> in an effort to end the civil war that has claimed more than 150,000 lives. The criticism came as <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> mediator <PERSON> Lakhdar </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Ibrahimi </PERSON>, an Algerian, met Christian legislators to discuss a planned meeting by <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s parliament in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> on Saturday on the proposed political reforms. Ibrahimi, deputy secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, later told reporters: `` The ball's now in the legislators' court.'' Legislator <PERSON> Jibran </PERSON> <PERSON> Taouk </PERSON> said <PERSON> Maronite </PERSON> deputies will `` announce our stand on the reforms Wednesday after a meeting with <PERSON> Gen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>.'' <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s leftist As-Safir daily reported that <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> was also `` exerting pressure on Christian parliamentary deputies prior to their departure for <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, a Maronite, was believed to be pushing the Christian deputies not to give too much away in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. The venue was selected because it will allow the deputies to discuss the reforms far from any pressure by the powerful militia leaders. The militias do not have representatives in parliament, which was elected in 1972. The civil war has prevented elections and the House has regularly renewed its four-year mandate. A Sunni Moslem parliamentary deputy, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the warlords were `` upset because deep down they do n't want an end to the war. `` It gave them privileges which they'll lose the moment peace prevails. A parliamentary meeting is stripping them of the capability to steer events. That's why they're rejecting in advance what we'll agree on in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>,'' he said. The Arab League peace plan calls for ending the Christians' 45 years of domination of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s political system. The Shiites, long downtrodden but now the most powerful Moslem faction in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, in particular are demanding sweeping reforms that would strip the Maronites of their privileges. At the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> today, Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> issued the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION>'s first formal appeal to Moslems and pleaded for their help in saving <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> `` Let your voices be heard, and even more, unite your efforts with those who demand for <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> the right to live,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said. The pontiff also said `` I firmly intend'' to go to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> but a <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman said no immediate trip was planned.

A judge threw out the case, saying the ad agency had acted like `` the average thief'' but broke no law.

<TEXT>
 An entire lake has been liquidated, so to speak, sold to two businessmen for $ 110,000 at a lakeside auction. The bidding for <ORGANIZATION> Hoosac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION>, a 120-year-old reservoir built to provide water power for mills, was part of a bankruptcy proceeding begun eight years ago by the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Print </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION>. The sale is subject to court approval. The winning bid in Monday's auction, held on a causeway spanning the 566-acre lake in the <LOCATION> Berkshire </LOCATION> hills of western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, was entered by <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Shea </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION> and <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Loscocco </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shea </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Loscocco </PERSON> own about half a dozen bodies of water in central <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> that are used mainly for recreation. `` We have an interest in water,'' <PERSON> Shea </PERSON> said. `` We have n't really developed anything and we do n't have any plans at this point to do any developing.'' Along with the lake, they get 50 acres on the shore. Some <LOCATION> Cheshire </LOCATION> residents were aprehensive about the sale, fearing that a private owner might charge admission or erect large developments. Some had hoped the auction would flop, proving the lake does n't have commercial potential and possibly opening the door for its donation to the town or state <LOCATION> Cheshire </LOCATION> had been paying $ 750 a year to use the lake. Town officials had said the lake would be a bad buy because of the cost of weeding, expected to be $ 31,000 this year, and because of the age of its dam. The lake was created in the 1860s, when a group of manufacturers bought land and dammed the <LOCATION> Hoosac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to produce water power. In 1912 the <ORGANIZATION> Hoosac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reservoir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was formed to oversee management of the water; <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Print </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> was the last remaining shareholder of that company.

<TEXT>
 Two days after a shootout between off-duty soldiers and neighbors suspected of selling drugs, officials moved to ease tension by holding a community meeting, doubling patrols and calling in a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> specialist. Army Sgt. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Foulk </PERSON>, whose neighborhood barbecue turned from an anti-crime gathering into a 30-minute gunfight Saturday night, maintained Monday that he and fellow members of an elite <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> unit acted in self-defense. `` They shot at us, and we fired back,'' he said, pointing at a reputed crack house across the street. Police arrested two suspected gang members on assault and weapons charges, confiscated guns including two semi-automatic rifles from the <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> and doubled patrols in the working-class Hilltop neighborhood. No one was injured, but scuffles and brick-throwing followed on Sunday between <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> supporters and neighbors who said they were being falsely accused of drug dealing. `` The hill is feeling such intensity right now,'' the Rev. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Alger </PERSON> said Monday. `` These people up here need to be protected. I'm surprised it escalated the way it did _ that's not what's meant by community mobilization _ but on the other hand people are really frightened `` What we do now is the question.'' Police Chief <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Fjetland </PERSON> said the incident could have been avoided had residents called police. <PERSON> Foulk </PERSON> said the gang members were upset that he was videotaping their activities. He said he called additional Rangers to his party when he felt threatened because police are too slow and equipped to act only after violence begins. `` When somebody starts shooting at me and my family, I'm going to shoot back,'' he said. A neighbor complained that racism was involved, prompting police to call in a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> community relations investigator. `` The gang members are mostly black, and of course they want to turn this into something racial,'' said <PERSON> Foulk </PERSON>, who is white. He said the neighborhood anti-drug coalition is multiracial and no racism was involved. Fellow Ranger Sgt. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolte </PERSON>, who is black, said four of the Rangers involved in the shooting were black. <PERSON> Fjetland </PERSON> attended a Monday night community meeting organized by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People. `` We're seriously concerned about the way blacks are treated by the police,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Tillman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> chapter president. He also criticized residents. `` You do not get trained soldiers using weapons of death in a neighborhood that small and believe you're going to come out a winner,'' he said. <PERSON> Foulk </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> acted on their own time with their own weapons. Army officials said they would await completion of a police investigation before deciding whether disciplinary action is warranted. But Maj. <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, second-in-command of the 2nd <ORGANIZATION> Ranger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battalion </ORGANIZATION> at nearby <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION>, said that `` from everything I am told by the city police, the Rangers were right. They were having a party, and they were attacked.''

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Defiant Slovenian lawmakers set a vote Wednesday on whether <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s most liberal republic should be allowed to secede, despite warnings that authorities could impose a state of emergency. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-setting <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the Slovenian <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the federal parliament scheduled emergency sessions today to discuss the political crisis sparked by the proposed amendments to the republic's constitution. Slovenian lawmakers in the federal parliament said they would boycott the <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> session. According to a proposed amendment, <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> would have a `` lasting and inalienable right to proclaim self-determination, including the right of secession.'' Another proposed amendment declares that Slovenian authorities have the sole right to declare a state of emergency in the region and to authorize the use of Yugoslav army units in the republic. <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, which borders <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, is the most prosperous and westward-looking of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s six constituent republics. It has already allowed an unprecedented degree of democratization, including the formation of several independent political parties. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s state and communist party leadership has criticized the amendments as being contrary to the federal constitution. The collective state presidency in charge of the armed forces said Monday it will use all `` legal measures'' to prevent the adoption of the amendments, indicating it might proclaim a state of emergency in the northern republic. <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said today, `` There are no convincing reasons for delaying the adoption of the amendments nor do they conflict with the Yugoslav constitution.'' The Slovenian Communists said, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency, that the amendments `` do not represent a danger for the future of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>.'' The Yugoslav federation is `` not being endangered by those demanding additional guarantees for the respect of the equality and sovereignty of its people.'' A recent public opinion poll conducted in the republic said that more than 70 percent of Slovenes favor the constitutional changes. Despite warnings by the eight-member presidency that the vote on the changes must be postponed, Slovenian parliament President <PERSON> Miran </PERSON> <PERSON> Potrc </PERSON> said he was certain the Slovenian legislature will adopt the amendments. Meanwhile, an influential war veterans organaization in the country's capital of <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> called for an urgent introduction of emergency measures in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> and for `` the arrest of all those responsible'' for the amendments, the <ORGANIZATION> Vecernje </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Novosti </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said.

 Truckloads of ice, plastic sheeting, bottled water other necessities are beginning to arrive from the outside world as a few services return to communities shattered by Hurricane Hugo. <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> reopened to limited ship traffic today in sunny but cool weather, and residents were advised Monday that the city's water supply is safe to drink without boiling. The storm, which rammed the coast Thursday night with winds of 135 mph and torrential rain, left at least $ 3 billion in damage, state officials said. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> killed 33 people as it rampaged through the <LOCATION> Carribean </LOCATION>; 28 deaths on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mainland are blamed on the hurricane and its remnants. Two inches of rain Monday fell on <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, and there was an 80 percent chance of showers today, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. `` It's going to make it harder to accomplish anything, going to make everything a little more miserable,'' said <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, of the weather service. Offers of outside help have begun to arrive. A <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> business sent two truckloads of ice Monday to help residents who have no electricity to refrigerate food. The ice from the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was delivered in tractor-trailers by the Perdue chicken company. The <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> will set up a food stand Thursday, offering a ton of fried catfish, hush puppies and French fries. Truckloads of plastic sheeting, blankets, trash bags, diapers, tools, bottled water and other necessities were sent by <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> stores, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Lockhart </PERSON> at the company's <LOCATION> Bentonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, headquarters `` We still have our sleeves rolled up,'' she said Monday. `` We'll find out what needs to be done and react accordingly.'' Utility companies across the South offered to send crews to help restore service to the thousands of homes and businesses blacked by the storm. More than 150 workers from the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> were on the job or on the way, said spokesman <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. Power was restored Monday to more than 200,000 people in the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION>, but at least 546,000 remained without service, according to utility company officials. It could be a month before full service is restored. Power has been restored to about 5 percent of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> customers, including hospitals. Commerce is picking up on <LOCATION> Broad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> in the heart of the Historic District, where some stores and restaurants used emergency generators Monday to power cooking and lighting. A few banks reopened, and some automatic-teller machines have sprung to life _ a godsend in a city where cash has become scarce. At the Citizens and <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> Monday, customers with checks to cash lined up under four light bulbs strung from a wire hooked to a generator. Tellers phoned transactions to banks in other parts of the state to record the information on computers, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, senior vice president. Down the street at <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>, volunteers manned a bank of phones set up as part of a nationwide relief effort. The city needs everything from canned goods and bread to building supplies, generators and roofing nails, said Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>. Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> announced the state would hire some of the estimated 224,000 workers displaced by the storm to help with cleanup efforts. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expanded his earlier disaster declaration to include four <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> counties. He already declared seven <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> counties as disaster areas. The declaration frees federal assistance and eases the way to getting loans for repairs. <ORGANIZATION> Seventeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships and five freighters were at anchor off the <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> waiting to return today, said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Moise </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. The port was closed Friday after tidal surge destroyed or displaced navigational buoys and caused shoaling within the channel. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> were checking for dangerous debris, and will completely reopen the harbor once it is found safe and all the buoys are replaced, she said. The port, the second largest on the East and <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> coasts, sustained millions of dollars in damage and lost business as ships were diverted to other ports, officials said. The Corps also began work on a temporary pontoon bridge to link devastated Isle of Palms and <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s Island to the mainland once again, but the coastal resort of <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> remained closed and guarded by troops against looters. The bridge to the Isle of Palms and <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> was wiped out by the storm. Residents on Monday were ferried to the Isle of Palms for brief looks at their property, and were allowed to collect one suitcase each of belongings. `` On a normal day, this was like being in heaven,'' resident <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Traywick </PERSON> said after getting his first post-storm look at the island. `` It's not like that any more,'' <PERSON> Traywick </PERSON> said. `` Not for a long time.''

<TEXT>
 An AIDS patient advocacy group says it will import a widely prescribed AIDS drug because the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturer is overcharging for it, an accusation the company strongly denies. `` Today we fight business with business,'' <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> With </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday. He charged that the drug, pentamidine, is priced now for `` the privileged few.'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said his organization, a self-described `` guerrilla drugstore,'' is arranging purchases of pentamidine in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> at less than half the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> price. The group hopes to pressure the American maker to lower its price here. A spokesman for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturer, <ORGANIZATION> Lyphomed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Rosemont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, said its price was appropriate given what the company spent on research, and said importation of the drug probably violates federal law. <ORGANIZATION> PWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> maintained its action is legal. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is investigating, a spokesman said. AIDS cripples the body's defenses against disease. There is no cure, but some drugs have been shown to help AIDS patients live longer. One of the best known, AZT, has also been the focus of criticism from AIDS activists who say it is overpriced. Pentamidine, inhaled as an aerosol, helps ward off a form of pneumonia that is the leading cause of death for AIDS patients. <ORGANIZATION> Lyphomed </ORGANIZATION> sells monthly doses wholesale for $ 99.45, and pharmacies mark that up to $ 105 and more. In <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, a version produced by a French company, <ORGANIZATION> Rhone-Poulenc </ORGANIZATION>, sells for about $ 30 per monthly dose retail. <ORGANIZATION> PWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> said it can fill <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prescriptions abroad at a retail cost of $ 40 per dose, including handling. <ORGANIZATION> Lyphomed </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> said the drug is profitable, but he would not give figures. He said the company spent $ 20 million testing it and developing the procedure by which it is inhaled rather than injected. No other manufacturer was willing to do that, he said. `` When the chips were down, <ORGANIZATION> Lyphomed </ORGANIZATION> was there,'' <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> said. `` Yes, the drug is profitable. But we are not profiteers.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> Lyphomed </ORGANIZATION> agreed to research pentamidine in the early 1980s when the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>, concerned about erratic supply, sought a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturer. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> granted <ORGANIZATION> Lyphomed </ORGANIZATION> an exclusive license for seven years beginning in 1984. Dr. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bihari </PERSON>, an AIDS specialist who joined the <ORGANIZATION> PWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> at its announcement, called <ORGANIZATION> Lyphomed </ORGANIZATION>'s price for the drug unconscionable. `` It's a wonderful treatment, a very effective one _ a lifesaving treatment,'' <PERSON> Bihari </PERSON> said. `` And for anything to interfere with the availability of that lifesaving treatment is unacceptable.'' <ORGANIZATION> PWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> chiefly helps AIDS patients buy personal supplies of prescription drugs that are legal abroad but not licensed for sale in this country. Such purchases are allowed by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> so long as the drugs are not bogus or dangerous. The group helps fill prescriptions for several hundred people, mostly in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> metropolitan area, with sales of about $ 1 million last year. The importation of pentamidine is the first case in which the group has imported a drug that is already sold here. <ORGANIZATION> PWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> said virtually everyone diagnosed with AIDS may be put on pentamidine at some point to help prevent pneumonia. The group said it hopes to to supply the drug to several thousand people, mostly in the metropolitan area. Federal authorities report that more than 100,000 people have been diagnosed with AIDS in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, about 40,000 of whom are still alive. They estimate that more than 250,000 people will have been diagnosed with AIDS by the end of 1991.

<TEXT>
 The author of legislation virtually eliminating congressional mass mailings and using the savings for drug treatment programs criticized <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators today for their decision to drop the measure. `` That is a disgrace,'' Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., told his colleagues on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, who is running for governor of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> next year and hopes to leave the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, complained that federal aid for drug treatment programs `` is not remotely sufficient.'' He said lawmakers' refusal to transfer funds from mailings to drug efforts is a signal to the public that as far as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is concerned, `` Our first priority is ourselves.'' The decision Monday by a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> to save the mailings was an embarrassing about-face for the House. Only two hours before, in a non-binding 245-137 vote, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> instructed its conference members to back <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> language virtually ending the free mailings. The conferees accepted a compromise to continue the mailings, but drop the number from six annually to three. The proposal was introduced by Rep. <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>, D-Calif., who pronounced the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote a fraud as soon as it ended `` This was not a vote to instruct the conferees so much as it was a vote to ... pose for holy pictures,'' he said. `` It's pure demagoguery but it's great politics.'' In the conference, however, <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., saved their wrath for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for starting the anti-free mailing campaign on Sept. 7 At the time, senators voted 83-8 for an amendment to ban all newsletters, town meeting notices and mailings to more than 500 households _ 95 percent of the mass mailings, according its sponsor, Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif. <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conferees <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, D-Nev. and <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Okla </LOCATION>. that senators wanted the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to `` do your dirty work,'' by saving the mass mailings after senators went on record as opposing <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> accepted the compromise to continue the mailings on a reduced scale. <PERSON> Nickels </PERSON> opposed the move, but no formal conference vote was taken once he admitted that <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>'s compromise would pass. The conferees must now submit their proposal separately to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, each of which would face the possibility of an embarrassing reversal. The bill approved by the conferees would appropriate $ 1.9 billion to run <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the next fiscal year. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> sought to transfer the estimated $ 45 million in savings from the anti-mailing plan to a treatment program for pregnant women addicted to drugs. <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON> said he was angry the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> tried to meddle in House affairs by controlling the mailings of both chambers, and Obey threatened future amendments to change <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rules, which are far less strict in the use of campaign money for office expenses. `` They want to keep their slush funds while posing for headlines,'' Obey said of senators. Obey said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> used the same tactic earlier this year, by overwhelmingly rejecting a proposed 51 percent pay raise for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, while secretly counting on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to pass an increase. The pay plan collapsed. Rep. <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Conte </PERSON>, R-Mass., who offered the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> resolution on mailings to follow the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s lead, said he would refuse to sign the conference report because `` We gave away the store. <PERSON> Conte </PERSON>, documenting what he called abuses of mass mailings, said that in the 1988 fiscal year, which ended about a month before congressional elections, the cost of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> newsletters rose steadily as the election approached _ from $ 5.9 million the first quarter to $ 16 million in the last quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> mass mailings rose from $ 3.8 million in the first quarter to $ 10 million in the fourth quarter. `` We really created a Frankenstein,'' <PERSON> Conte </PERSON> said. `` The only way we're going to free ourselves from this monster is to cut its head off ... and use it for something worthwhile.'' The language on mass mailing would establish separate mass mail accounts: $ 54.5 million, or 65 percent of the total, for the 435-member <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>; and $ 29.3 million, or 35 percent, for the 100-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. In addition, the provision calls for $ 31.7 million to cover mailing costs through the end of 1989. Currently, there are six mass mailings of newsletters a year, but they would be reduced to three beginning next Jan. 1. There would be a two-sheet limit.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Investigators believe they have found traces of a powerful plastic explosive in the wreckage of a French DC-10 airliner that exploded over the <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION> desert, two French newspapers reported today. The dailies Liberation and <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Parisien </PERSON> said the discovery strengthened the link between last week's <ORGANIZATION> UTA </ORGANIZATION> crash and the December 1988 bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. The news accounts, quoting unidentified sources involved in the inquiry, said the presence of Semtex, a malleable and difficult-to-detect explosive made in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, still had to be confirmed by laboratory tests in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Liberation reported the explosive may have been hidden in a shipment of farm chemicals put on the plane in <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>, where it originated. The plane disappeared less than an hour after takeoff following a stopover in <LOCATION> N'Djamena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>. All 171 people aboard were killed. French investigators have said it appears certain an `` explosive substance'' in a front cargo compartment caused the crash but have not elaborated publicly on what explosive may have been used. The parallels between last week's crash and the Dec. 21 <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> disaster have already been widely noted. It is believed that a radio-cassette player rigged with Semtex was placed aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> that made a change of planes in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> before the explosion. The Syrian-backed Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> is considered the prime suspect behind that attack, though the group's leader <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON> has denied involvement. Police in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> seized an air pressure-activated bomb hidden in a radio when they raided houses and apartments occupied by suspected radical Palestinians in October last year. A British television inquiry into the Flight 103 bombing said Monday that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> committed major blunders, including releasing the probable bomb-maker after the October raid. The <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s current affairs program `` Panorama'' said investigators are convinced <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>'s group masterminded the attack. West German authorities arrested 16 men in the October raid but released 14 of them, including a Jordanian, <PERSON> Marwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Khreesat </PERSON>. `` Panorama'' said <PERSON> Khreesat </PERSON> is widely believed to have made the <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> bomb and several others. Asked why <PERSON> Khreesat </PERSON> was released, <PERSON> Hans-Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Foerster </PERSON>, spokesman for the West German prosecutor's office, said Monday, `` He was released because there was no urgent suspicion of his connection with a crime.'' Claims of responsibility for the <ORGANIZATION> UTA </ORGANIZATION> crash from anonymous callers in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on behalf of the Moslem extremist group <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jihad </ORGANIZATION> and a previously unknown Chadian organization have not been authenticated. French police appear to be treating the claims with great skepticism. On Monday, Investigating Magistrate <PERSON> Jean-Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruguieres </PERSON>, an anti-terrorism specialist heading the criminal investigation, officially called on the <ORGANIZATION> DST </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s counterespionage police, to aid in the probe, judicial sources said. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Bruguieres </PERSON> made a specific written request to the <ORGANIZATION> Direction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surveillance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Territoire </ORGANIZATION> for assistance. The sources said they did not know exactly what tasks the agency's officers were called on to undertake.

 Letter carriers here have agreed to pay 25 cents out of their own pockets for each misdelivered piece of mail. The bounty will be paid to residents of this <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> suburb who return the wrongly delivered letters. `` We're calling it the Worthington Letter Carriers Money Back Guarantee,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, said today. The 60-day trial program along 11 routes is an outgrowth of a national, voluntary program by the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Letter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carriers </ORGANIZATION>. `` We wanted to indicate to our customers that we were concerned about getting their mail delivered to them properly, and we wanted to make sure that we were going to do everything we could in order to do that,'' <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said a similar program in High Point, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, operated for about a year and paid out $ 26. Under the program, which began Monday, carriers will pay for any misdelivered first-class items that had been properly addressed. Customers will be given a form to fill out and an envelope in which to return the misdelivered mail at no cost. About 3,000 to 5,000 customers will be involved in the project <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said the the union would pay for misdeliveries by part-time or substitute carriers.

 Suspected Communist rebels today killed two Americans near a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military base shortly before Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> arrived for a visit to discuss the future of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases here, officials said. Six unidentified gunmen firing from a passenger jeep killed the pair at about 5 p.m. in <LOCATION> Capas </LOCATION>, about 60 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, said Col. <PERSON> Florentino </PERSON> <PERSON> Amorabon </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION> in central <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION>. The names of the two were withheld. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> statement said the two were civilian employees of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a contractor at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> O'Donnell </LOCATION>, a U.S.-run facility about 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and 12 miles from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Clark Air Base. A <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the names of the dead were being held until relatives could be identified. The Americans' car had been blocked by a dump truck and the jeep. The gunmen jumped out of the jeep, sprayed their car with semi-automatic weapons fire and then opened the car door and fired into the victims' bodies, said Lt. <PERSON> Pepito </PERSON> <PERSON> Pimentel </PERSON>, station commander of the Capas police. The military believes the assailants were <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rebels, who operate in the <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> area, <PERSON> Amorabon </PERSON> said. In April, rebels killed <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> as he was driving to the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Quezon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. In October 1987, rebels killed three Americans in simultaneous attacks outside Clark Air Base. Also today, suspected Communist rebels killed a captain from President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s guard force in an ambush about one mile southeast of where the president will hold talks with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on Wednesday. As <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> arrived today on a three-day visit, hundreds of leftists burned his effigy and an American flag while chanting `` Bases out!, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> go home!'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> made no statement as he arrived at Ninoy Aquino International Airport from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where he ended a six-day visit with a short stop on <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>, an island that was a major World War II battlefield and today is home for more than 35,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops. Before boarding a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> flight to <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, the third leg of his Asian tour, the vice president called his <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> visit positive and said it helped strengthen the two nations' `` global partnership.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s talks in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> were to focus on the future of <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, the Subic Bay naval base and four smaller installations, the leases of which expire in September 1991. The left-wing League of Filipino Students and the May First Movement, a militant labor confederation, have announced plans for demonstrations during the vice president's visit. Nine policemen were injured and nine students were arrested today when security forces broke up a rally at <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Adamson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, officials said. Despite the security, about 150 members of the League of Filipino Students and the Youth for Nationalism and Democracy reached the airport terminal a few hours before <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> arrived. Protesters shouted `` <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> go home, bases out!'' and `` Yankees go home!'' They carried banners reading `` Quayle visit _ a curse.'' After negotiations with police, the group agreed to withdraw about a half mile away along the main road into the city. Police estimated the crowd grew to nearly 1,000 by the time <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> arrived. Police and troops in the capital also were on alert because of a series of bombings in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> that have killed two people and injured 16 since Sept. 16. Early today, suspected rebels killed Capt. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Daileg </PERSON>, a staff officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, in an ambush in the city's <LOCATION> Pandacan </LOCATION> district. He was the fourth member of the presidential guard slain in the past four months. On Monday, Acting Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was bringing a letter from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> believed to include a proposal to begin talks on extending the lease on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has offered new talks but refuses to say whether she will support an extension. Any new agreement must be ratified by two-thirds of the 23-member Philippine <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where opposition to the bases is strong. About 40,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops, military depedents and civilian employees are stationed at the bases, among the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military facilities overseas. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is to visit <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and <PERSON> Subic </PERSON> on Wednesday. On Thursday, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> travels to <LOCATION> Corregidor </LOCATION> island, where <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Filipino troops battled Japanese invaders during World War II, before leaving for <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. In October, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Filipino negotiators agreed to allow the bases to remain until 1991 in return for $ 431 million a year in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. American officials say they are not prepared to pay substantially more to keep the bases. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on Monday, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he discussed with Prime Minister <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> a letter from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> requesting more Japanese support in the war against illicit drugs.

 Urine samples taken two days after a <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> jet skidded into the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> contained no sign of drug or alcohol use by the pilot or co-pilot, prosecutors say. The test results were made public by the office of Queens District Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Santucci </PERSON> on Monday, the same day he announced that a grand jury would look into the crash that killed two people last week. Tests on samples taken from the pilot and co-pilot on Friday showed no evidence of drugs such as cocaine, heroin or amphetamines, or alcohol, said <PERSON> Santucci </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Piperno </PERSON>. Results of similar tests by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> will not be available for several weeks. The captain, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, and co-pilot, <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleissas </PERSON>, were criticized by federal officials for failing to submit to testing immediately after the crash, although they are not legally required to do so. Medical experts said alcohol would not normally show up in urine samples taken two days after ingestion but that traces of drugs such as marijuana or cocaine probably would. The test means `` that they were free of drugs and or alcohol at the time that the sample was taken,'' <PERSON> Piperno </PERSON> said today. The jet, en route to <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, skidded into the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> after the crew tried to abort takeoff at <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on Wednesday. Investigators said the co-pilot reported he inadvertently punched a button that cut the throttle, and the pilot told officials that he aborted takeoff because of a vibration and because the jet began to veer for some reason. The pilots' lawyer, <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hafetz </PERSON>, said the results `` come as no surprise. We had fully anticipated they would be negative, and indeed people's observations of the pilots on the night of the flight was totally consistent with their being in full control of themselves.'' <PERSON> Piperno </PERSON> said he also knew of no evidence indicating the men were under the influence at the time of the crash. In announcing the criminal investigation, <PERSON> Santucci </PERSON> said he had no prospective targets and would not seek specific criminal charges. Among the things the grand jury would investigate was how the crew was picked for the flight, he said. The two men, flying together for the first time, had been chosen from a pool of pilots with the least seniority. The co-pilot, who had flown a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-400 only once before on a regular passenger flight, was attempting his first takeoff in that model with passengers aboard. Both pilots had been working about 12 hours. <PERSON> Santucci </PERSON>'s decision to investigate is unusual, if not unprecedented, airline insiders said. `` We're not aware of criminal charges in the past ever being brought here in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> against an airline pilot'' following a crash, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Macor </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hafetz </PERSON> said he had no comment on the investigation. Charges that a grand jury might be asked to consider include criminally negligent homicide, vehicular manslaughter and leaving the scene of an accident, according to sources in <PERSON> Santucci </PERSON>'s office who requested anonymity. An airplane is considered a vehicle under <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law.

 Jurors at <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s fraud trial watched videotapes of <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s TV show today, including one in which `` Love Boat'' captain <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLeod </PERSON> said <PERSON> God </PERSON> had saved his marriage. The jurors saw a 1985 show on which <PERSON> MacLeod </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Patty </PERSON>, discussed how their Christian faith allowed them to remarry three years after they divorced. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>, also discussed their marital problems. <PERSON> MacLeod </PERSON> began crying when he was introduced by <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, saying, `` I do n't think I've stopped crying since I came to the Lord.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> talked about how many Hollywood stars have appeared on <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> shows. `` What is God doing?'' he asked. `` He wo n't leave you alone. God wants to take <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> had experienced their own marital problems. `` <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> said ` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>, I do n't love you anymore.' And I said, ` I do n't love you anymore, either,''' he said, adding that they were able to save their marriage because of their strong faith. `` What these people are saying is real,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said. `` Our marriage died and their marriage died. Sure, we still have problems. But to get to heaven, you have to have had problems.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> is accused of defrauding followers by using more than $ 3.7 million in ministry money to live in style. He faces up to 120 years in prison and more than $ 5 million in fines if convicted on all 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy. On Monday, a former builder for <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> testified that the Rev. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, who took over <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned in a sex and money scandal, offered <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> a $ 300,000 annual salary for life and other perks to keep quiet. Defense attorney <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> never asked <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> what <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was supposed to keep quiet about. It was not clear whether <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> turned down the alleged offer. <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> <PERSON> Messner </PERSON>, tstifying for the defense, was not questioned further about the matter. But a <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> spokesman said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> had asked for the money and perks. <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> also said a <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> official claimed <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> knew nothing about $ 265,000 in hush money paid to <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, the church secretary with whom <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> had a sexual encounter in 1980. <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> sent him to <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, in May 1987 to offer <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> a deal: the $ 300,000 salary, a maid, a security guard, health insurance and telephone expenses `` if he kept his mouth shut.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>, jotted down the offer on a piece of her pink stationery, and <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> wrote at the bottom: `` ` I'm not making any demands on <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>. I'm not asking for anything,''' according to <PERSON> Messner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, founder of the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> Moral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Majority </ORGANIZATION>, denied <PERSON> Messner </PERSON>'s account. The offer actually was a demand from <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMoss </PERSON>, in a telephone interview <PERSON> DeMoss </PERSON> said <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> did dispatch <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> to talk to <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, but he carried no offer. <PERSON> DeMoss </PERSON> said <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> returned with a handwritten list of demands on the Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s stationery. <PERSON> DeMoss </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s demands included hospital insurance, a $ 300,000 annual salary for life, a $ 100,000 annual salary for life for his wife, royalties on inspirational books and recordings made by the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION>, secretary and maid service for a year, use of a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> lakefront house and furniture and attorneys' fees. <PERSON> Messner </PERSON>, who testified that he handled the $ 265,000 payment to Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, also said that at a Feb. 21, 1985, lunch, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> Executive Vice President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> told him: `` ` I'm going to ask you to do a big favor. I'm asking you because I know you'll keep it confidential.''' <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> told <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> that if he did n't pay a woman from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> $ 265,000, then she would go to The <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> Observer with allegations that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> raped her. Five days later, <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> said, he wired the $ 265,000 to an account number in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> that was given to him by <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>. <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> said he asked <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> if <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> knew about the payment, and <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> replied: `` ` No, I'm acting on my own.''' <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> said he agreed to make the payment in part because the Assemblies of God was named as the potential party in a lawsuit threatened by Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>. `` I did n't think the church ought to be dragged into this incident,'' <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> said.

 Officers used tear gas to quell a jail riot early today and then negotiated an end to a standoff with 150 other inmates who barricaded themselves in their dorms with piled-up furniture, officials said. Six officers and six inmates were taken to a hospital as a precaution, but no serious injuries were reported in the uprising at the 2,700-inmate jail on <LOCATION> Rikers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryles </PERSON>. The damage was being assessed this morning, she said. About 50 inmates set fires and blockaded their dorm with mattresses, complaining that one of two men removed earlier from the unit for fighting had been unfairly punished, said <PERSON> Ryles </PERSON>. About 3 a.m., officers used tear gas to end the uprising, but some 150 prisoners in three other dormitories barricaded themselves in for more than an hour by piling up beds, chairs, tables and other items, the spokeswoman said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> officials trying to curtail a constant line outside the embassy on Tuesday announced new rules on emigration procedures aimed at lightening the work load in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and limiting the number of would-be emigrants. The announcement was made to an agitated crowd of several hundred Soviets, who were gathered around the embassy seeking permission to emigrate or visit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Dozens pushed and grabbed for the one-sheet explanation of the rules, which take effect Oct. 1. According to the document, applications for emigration now will have to be sent to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> instead of being dealt with in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> because of the flood of requests pouring into the embassy here. Lines of hundreds of people have been forming around the embassy every day since Soviet officials began liberalizing emigration policies last year. There have been reports recently that spaces in line are going for hundreds of dollars. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will continue to receive applications from all interested Soviet citizens, but priority in scheduling interviews will be given to those with close relatives ... who are citizens or legal residents of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, as well as those of special concern to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' according to the document handed out Tuesday. `` Many who have no close family ties in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will face long delays and may wish to explore alternative destinations. Not all those who apply will be given appointments,'' it warned. Soviets will be notified by mail from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> if they are to be interviewed in the embassy in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Soviets using Israeli visas _ mostly Jews _ will not be able to apply for entrance to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> if their Soviet exit visa is dated after Oct. 1, the document said. Many Soviet Jews are waiting in those cities for admission to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> instead of going to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The Geneva-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Migration </ORGANIZATION> said more than 30,000 Soviet Jews had arrived at its transit point in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> from January through August. The head of the Soviet visa office, <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuznetsov </PERSON>, said on Aug. 22 that 200,000 Soviets are expected to emigrate this year. Besides the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, many want to go to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. About 50,000 people, mostly ethnic Germans, had left for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> by the end of August. A senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said earlier this month that the embassy had received 10,000 new applications in August alone, adding to a backlog of 32,000 cases. `` The number of people applying to go to the states is skyrocketing and going far beyond the cap on refugees,'' he said. `` The great majority of people leaving can not qualify under the law to be refugees ... and most are not claiming to be refugees.'' Compared to 1988, when 85 percent to 90 percent of the applicants were Armenians, in August 45 percent of the applicants were Jews, 35 percent were Armenians, and 10 percent were Russians, he said. He said 70 percent of the <LOCATION> Russians </LOCATION> had no relatives at all in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said the embassy will monitor the list of interviews granted by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and the number of people who appear for an interview to determine whether the Soviet mail system can be trusted to deliver notification.

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Parliament today adopted liberal laws that guarantee free travel abroad and emigration, the first of a sweeping set of changes intended transform Communist <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> into a multi-party democracy. The new laws lifted most restrictions on travel, meaning that Hungarians no longer require permission from authorities for foreign travel or emigration. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s liberal policies in this respect were demonstrated by a government decision in May to begin removing barbed wire fencing and other obstacles on its border with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. This Warsaw Pact country also allowed thousands of East Germans seeking to emigrate to the West to cross legally into <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, angering its hard-line allies. The session that opened today is to decide a series of key bills that are to pave the way for next year's elections in June, the first free and open multi-party balloting in more than 40 years of Communist rule. The volume of legislation prompted lawmkers to vote for an extension of the session in October after a two-week break to allow lawmakers to study the draft laws. The current session was originally scheduled to end Friday. Legislators will have to vote on six key bills, including one on the functioning of political parties, a new electoral law, the establishment of a constitutional court and changes in the penal code. The legislators today approved membership of four opposition members who received a majority at recent by-elections, marking the first time members of the opposition took their seats in the Communist-dominated assembly. <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> <PERSON> Roszik </PERSON>, the first opposition member elected in July, was accompanied to the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> building by supporters waving flags. `` Democracy has returned to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> after a 40-year exile,'' <PERSON> Roszik </PERSON> told the house. `` This is one of the most significant steps of the revolution underway in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, as we move from dictatorial socialism to democracy,'' <PERSON> Roszik </PERSON> said. `` The millions of Hungarians have never paid such close attention to our work as they do now.'' The bills before <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> this week are designed to bring legislation in line with preparations for the multi-party elections, which would be the first since the Communists consolidated power in 1948. More than 70 percent of the 387 members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> are Communists. So-called independent candidates elected after 1985 when <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> instituted multi-candidate elections had to be approved by a Communist-affiliated organization. Parliament is also expected to discuss the creation of a post of president which would replace the current 21-man collective presidency, and determine the date and form of his election. There has been considerable pressure for the president to be elected before the end of the year to provide political stability during the transition phase before the elections. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, like <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> ally <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, has embraced and in fact exceeded the liberal reforms and progressive politics encouraged by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Both nations are seeking closer trade and investment ties to the West to improve their economies as they pursue social reforms, moves that have alienated them from such hard-line <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations as <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Burma Sentences Five to Death for Beheadings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A military tribunal in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> has sentenced five people to death for beheading three people they wrongly suspected of poisoning drinking water during last year's pro-democracy uprising, state radio said <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said in a broadcast Monday that two men and one woman were beheaded at the junction of U <LOCATION> Wisara </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Shwedagon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pagoda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roads </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> `` during last year's disturbances.'' `` The victims were falsely accused of poisoning drinking water,'' the radio said. The report, received in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> on Tuesday, did not give the date of the incident. But Western news reports at the the time described the beheadings on Sept. 8 last year, when crowds of up to a million paraded through <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> demanding an end to years of authoritarian rule. <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said the tribunal heard that <PERSON> Ma </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON> <PERSON> Khine </PERSON> `` kicked the woman accused of poisoning the water and barbarously severed -LRB- her -RRB- head.'' Another defendant, <PERSON> Aye </PERSON> <PERSON> Cho </PERSON>, used a sword to behead one of the men, it said. Two others, <PERSON> Nan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shwe </PERSON> <PERSON> Toe </PERSON>, helped with the killings and helped hang the severed heads on a signboard at the road junction, the report said. The fifth convicted, <PERSON> Po </PERSON> <PERSON> Lu </PERSON>, also assisted in the murders, `` posed for pictures with the severed heads, tied one on a bamboo pole and displayed it by marching along ... and helped burn the corpses,'' the radio said. At the end of last month, a military tribunal in northwestern <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> sentenced 11 people to death for beheading four policemen, also during the uprising. Last year's demonstrations were crushed after a series of bloody army clampdowns in which thousands were killed. The government has used the sporadic violence that occurred during the largely peaceful protests to justify its use of force against dissent, saying the country was on the verge of anarchy. It continues to rule by martial law. Some dissidents have blamed the violence and rumors _ such as those surrounding the poisoning of drinking water _ on government-paid provocateurs. Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> say several thousand pro-democracy activists have been arrested since opposition leaders <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> and Tin Oo were placed under house arrest July 19.

 Handicapped people demanding wheelchair lifts on public buses blocked entrances to a federal building for a second day today after President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> let them spend the night rather than send them out into the rain. Two officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> arrived with a third, unidentified official just before noon today to meet with protest leaders. But the 80 or so demonstrators, many in wheelchairs, made good on a vow to block entrances of the main level of the <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> building at noon if their demands were not met. The activists began the demonstration Monday, when at least two dozen chained themselves to doors or blocked exits with their wheelchairs. `` This is a real national effort and we want people to know about it,'' said <PERSON> Marca </PERSON> <PERSON> Bristo </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, one of the protest organizers. The demonstrators want a federal order requiring all new public buses bought with federal funds to be equipped with wheelchair lifts. Government officials have estimated this would cost $ 90 million a year. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> intervened Monday night after authorities ejected several protesters and organizers said they would continue demonstrating outside, in a cold downpour. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cason </PERSON>, regional administrator for the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said the president ordered that the demonstrators be brought in out of the rain. `` He's concerned about their plight and their safety,'' <PERSON> Cason </PERSON> said. But protest organizer <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Auberger </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, said his group, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disabled </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accessible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, would step up the protest to dispel the notion that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is openly addressing their demands. `` The administration, up to now, was willing to throw us out. If we do n't do something, they'll just let us sit here,'' <PERSON> Auberger </PERSON> said. `` We're going to close it back down again. They need to know our issue is n't going away.'' ADAPT members are demanding that <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> sign an executive order requiring the lifts. They said they also want the administration to implement a 1986 law requiring better disabled access at airports. The protesters say they wont' t move until <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, who visited <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> on Monday for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s convention, signs the <PERSON> Cason </PERSON> said no decision had been made as to whether the protesters would be removed today. `` We'll play it as we go,'' he said. The demonstrators' blockade near the main entrances to the building Monday forced employees and others to leave use an exit on the lower level. ADAPT has also been trying to force the installation of lifts on all new buses through the courts. In <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, a federal appeals panel backed their lawsuit, saying federal law requires lifts on new buses. But in July, the full 3rd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> overturned that ruling, saying government officials did not have to put lifts on all buses if they thought some other method of serving the handicapped would be better. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>, an attorney for ADAPT, said the group was waiting to see what <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did on the bus issue before deciding whether to appeal.

 With growing international prestige, President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> goes to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this week seeking <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> help with an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan and dialogue he has proposed. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> will urge President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s administration to take concrete action instead of just expressing cautious approval, as it has done so far, <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> officials said. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> wants <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to nudge <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, led by Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, into accepting the dialogue and a 10-point guideline plan, according to Egyptian officials speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> arrives in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Thursday and will meet <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Monday. Egyptian officials call the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> talks crucial. `` It's crucial in the sense that it may make or break current peace efforts involving the dialogue proposal, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s plan for Palestinian elections and <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s 10-point formula to spruce up that plan,'' a senior government official said. <LOCATION> Osama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Baz </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s political adviser, told reporters that <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> will talk with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` to crystallize an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> position bolstering <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s efforts to open a <LOCATION> Palestinian-Israeli </LOCATION> dialogue.'' A government official, who asked that his name be withheld for diplomatic reasons, spoke bluntly. `` We want the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to step in with its full clout and put pressure on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, junior partner in <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s Cabinet coalition, generally approves <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s suggestion of an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> to discuss Palestinian elections in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has rejected <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s key ideas in public remarks, but his divided <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> is to take a final decision next month. In May, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> proposed elections to choose representatives to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on interim self-rule for the two territories, where about 1.7 million Palestinians live. In July, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> put 10 questions to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, urging affirmative answers that would make the election proposal more palatable to the Palestinians. The <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> approach would guarantee freedom of the balloting under international supervision and allow 140,000 Palestinian residents of Israeli-annexed <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to vote. It also would link the election to an eventual final settlement based on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> giving up occupied territory for peace. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> has said <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> accepts the Egyptian blueprint. But the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which wants an official <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> stand first, has delayed an official position pending a meeting of its Central Council in mid-October. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, whose peacemaking efforts have turned <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> into a diplomatic beehive, has seen his stature grow considerably in the Arab world in the past two years. Most Arab countries that broke with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> over its 1979 peace treaty with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> have restored diplomatic relations, and <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> regained its Arab League membership in May after a 10-year suspension. In February, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> arranged for visiting Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> to meet separately in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>. During his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> stop, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> will thrash out his and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s peace ideas at meetings with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> and Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The following are excerpts from Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s speech Tuesday to the General Assembly: We welcome the proposal concerning chemical weapons put forward yesterday by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Generally consistent with the well-known initiatives of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leadership, it indicates to us that we share the desire to rid mankind of those barbaric weapons. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is ready, together with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, to go further and assume mutual obligations prior to the conclusion of a multilateral convention: _ Cease the production of chemical weapons, as we have done already -LRB- I am referring also to binary weapons -RRB-: _ On a bilateral basis, radically reduce or completely destroy Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chemical weapons, regarding it as a step toward the global destruction of chemical weapons; _ Renounce the use of chemical weapons under any circumstances; _ Institute rigorous verification of the cessation of production of chemical warfare agents. I think that there is no need to say how beneficial that would be for the overall climate in the world. If <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries agree to start talks on tactical nuclear weapons, the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION> will respond by further unilateral cuts in its tactical nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The problem of missile proliferation is also ripe for multilateral discussions. ... No one in the world can as yet bid a farewell to arms. But we can abandon, once and for all _ and do it now, the practice of unconstrained and uncontrolled international weapons transfers. <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION> is ready to reinstate its moratorium on all nuclear explosions any day and hour, if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> states </LOCATION> reciprocates. Secondly, it is time finally to end the procedural impasse at the Conference on Disarmament and start concrete discussions there on the problem of a complete test ban. Thirdly, as one possible way toward such a ban, we are now considering the possibility of extending the 1963 Treaty to cover underground nuclear explosions. ... In addition, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is proposing that all nuclear powers, above all the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, should begin preparing to conclude an agreement on the cessation and prohibition, of the production of such material.

 Vandals sliced a cable inside a manhole, cutting service to 12,000 telephone lines in what <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said today was the worst case of sabotage since a strike against its parent began Aug. 5. `` Because of the way it was done, it could take several days to restore service to everyone,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>. About 4,000 suburban <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> telephone customers plus 8,000 customers with data lines, such as computer services and burglar alarm companies, lost service, he said. <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police Officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> said the cable was cut Monday night. <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> said most of the lines cut were copper, and crews will have to go through neighboring manholes and break through walls to run new cable. `` You have to have a special tool to lift the manhole cover, and then have cable cutters,'' he said. `` It was a professional job.'' <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> says it has sustained 325 acts of vandalism statewide affecting about 75,000 customers since the Communications Workers went on strike against <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>`Mad Dads' Group Leads Community Response to Gangs, Drugs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> gangs have found a new market for their drugs in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, and the resulting violence has stirred a group of fathers calling themselves `` Mad Dads'' to fight back. The Mad Dads, armed only with radios, patrol gang-infested areas of north <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> to break up drug deals and reclaim neighborhoods marked as gang turf. Earlier this month, they announced plans to use a helicopter, but a spokesman said Monday the group was grounding that idea because it caused too much controversy. Formed by fathers angry about gangs known as the Bloods and Crips dealing drugs in their neighborhood, Mad Dads has expanded its reach throughout the city. `` We felt we had to get out on the streets and start offering to our community some semblance of security,'' <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Staton </PERSON>, an organizer, said last week. `` If Mad Dads have done anything citywide, it's created an atmosphere that there are some folks fighting back who have been perceived as part of the problem,'' <PERSON> Staton </PERSON> said. Police estimate there are about 50 hard-core Crips in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> and an equal number of rival Bloods. Each gang also has about 200 associates and `` wannabe'' members in the city, police said. The Los Angeles-based gangs have established a drug trade laced with a kind of violence new to this largely middle-class city of 350,000. Drive-by shootings are becoming commonplace, and one public housing project is so racked by drugs and violence that residents have nicknamed it `` <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.'' After gang members beat <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, <PERSON> Staton </PERSON> and four other men formed a committee that in May became Mad Dads _ Men <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Destruction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defending </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drugs </ORGANIZATION> and Social Disorder. The group has grown from to more than 200, 85 percent of whom are black, <PERSON> Staton </PERSON> said. `` We had to figure a way of ... giving the good men in our community who are not involved in pimping, in drugs, in drug sales and violence an opportunity to band together and really be heard,'' he said. Besides running neighborhood foot patrols, Mad Dads paint over gang graffiti and organize drug - and alcohol-free parties for youths Other groups as well as police and prosecutors also are fighting drugs in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, and businesses raised $ 700,000 this summer for a program to provide needy youngsters jobs, job training and educational and recreational programs. <PERSON> Staton </PERSON> said the drug and gang problem is rooted in the economic conditions of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, which he said include 30 percent unemployment, poor housing, inadequate educational opportunities and institutional racism. `` Here comes somebody saying ... ` You can take this dope and sell it and here's how you can make money, a lot of money. And you can sleep all day and be out having a good time all night.' That's tempting for adults, let alone young people,'' <PERSON> Staton </PERSON> said Mad Dads believe their strategy of offering positive male role models, alternatives to gang activity and making drug dealers uncomfortable will help crush the gangs. But the group is gearing up for a long fight. `` This is not a battle that just starts today and is going to end next week,'' <PERSON> Staton </PERSON> said. `` This is a program that's got to be put in place now for the next 10 to 20 years of community involvement, of men being involved in their community in a positive way.''

<HEAD>Orders Post Biggest Gain Since December</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for `` big ticket'' durable goods accelerated 3.8 percent last month, riding brisk automobile sales to the biggest gain since December, the government said Tuesday. But some economists questioned whether that volatile manufacturing sector could keep up the pace in the face of a slowing economy and said the first decline in unfilled orders since February 1987 was a sign of weakness. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said demand for durable goods, items expected to last more than three years, totaled a seasonally adjusted $ 126.7 billion after declining 2.5 percent in July. The July figure was revised from a 1.9 percent drop reported earlier. After rising 7.4 percent in December, durable goods orders have see-sawed this year, rising in March, April, June and August and falling in January, February, May and July. Orders in the transportation sector last month rose 6.3 percent to $ 36.3 billion as a big increase for motor vehicles offset a decline in aircraft. Transportation orders had risen 1.8 percent in July. Even without the transporation sector, durable goods orders were up 2.7 percent after falling 4 percent the previous month. `` I doubt that the automobile pace will continue,'' said <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> DRI </ORGANIZATION> @ <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, business forecasting organization. She noted that some automakers are reducing their production schedules and offering rebates and subsidized financing to spur sales of 1990 models even before they get to the showroom. Both Ms. <PERSON> Latta </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, chief financial economist for <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, pointed to the 0.3 percent decline in unfilled orders as evidence of weakness `` The backlog of orders declined everywhere except transportation and that's only because of autos,'' <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON> said. `` That decline says demand is slackening.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, which raised interest rates for 14 months to slow the economy and control inflation, began in June to nudge rates down. Durable goods orders are particularly sensitive to interest rates because consumers and businesses often have to borrow to finance such purchases. Nevertheless, analysts said Tuesday's report would not spur the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to further action. `` For now, it probably tends to keep the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> on hold,'' <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Latta </PERSON> agreed, saying, `` It ca n't tune policy to bail out the durable goods manufacturers; it has to look at the whole economy.'' Orders for non-electrical machinery, which includes computers and a wide variety of industrial equipment, increased 9.2 percent to $ 22.8 billion, but that was a rebound from a 10.4 percent decline in July. Other sectors were down, including the closely watched non-defense capital goods sector, which fell 9.8 percent to $ 37.4 billion. Economists watch this category as a barometer of business investment plans. Electrical machinery orders declined 0.9 percent to $ 19.6 billion, with communications equipment showing the largest decrease. Primary metals, including steel, were off 1.9 percent to $ 11.3 billion. Excluding the defense category, which swings widely from month to month, orders gained 3.9 percent after falling 1.5 percent in July. Military orders increased 1.9 percent to $ 7.8 billion after plunging 14.7 percent in July. Shipments of durable goods in August rose 9.5 percent, the biggest increase since a 4.5 percent advance in January 1983. But automobiles again accounted for this gain since the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> considers auto orders and shipments to be the same.

 The White House today welcomed as a `` very constructive response'' the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s acceptance of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s offer to reduce chemical weapons jointly and go beyond that to ban the devices under a global agreement. House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan for U.S.-Soviet reductions `` a good first step'' but said it does not answer the question of how to control chemical weapons production by other countries. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, in a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> speech today, said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will join the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and `` radically reduce or completely destroy'' all its chemical weapons stockpiles. He also challenged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to join the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in stopping production of all chemical weapons, halting nuclear tests and stopping the manufacture of weapons-grade plutonium and uranium. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s response `` shows that we are on the same wavelength. It was a very constructive response. Our ultimate objective is total elimination of chemical weapons. And it appears that both nations are now ready to act.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said after a meeting of congressional leaders with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, `` something we're concerned about trying to bring about is participation of third countries and countries that have a potential but not yet a significant production.'' Administration officials contend agreement on chemical weapons reduction by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> could also spur the smaller countries to sign a ban. `` These are steps in the right direction,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan `` I do n't think many of us feel that all the potential has been explored yet and we'd like to urge the president forward, but certainly these are positive steps.'' He said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s proposal for a complete abolition of chemical weapons by the two superpowers, apparently regardless of when or whether the smaller countries sign on to a treaty, `` seems like an issue worth discussion.'' `` We welcome the proposal concerning chemical weapons put forward yesterday by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said. `` Generally consistent with the well-known initiatives of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leadership, it indicates to us that we share the desire to rid mankind of those barbaric weapons.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> returned Monday night from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> after outlining before the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> his offer of an 80 percent cut in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chemical weapons stockpiles. The proposal, designed to spur a 40-nation conference in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to ban all chemical weapons within 10 years, would have the two superpowers reduce their stockpiles to a level equivalent to 20 percent of the current <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> level. That would mean deeper cuts for the Soviets, because <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials contend <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has far greater stockpiles than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ an acknowledged 50,000 tons compared to an estimated 30,000 tons for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed a U.S.-Soviet agreement to begin those cuts at once, while a 40-nation treaty is being worked out in which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would destroy 98 percent of its chemical weapons over eight years if the Soviets joined the ban. The remaining 2 percent would be destroyed within 10 years if all nations capable of building such weapons agreed to a total ban. While only the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> acknowledge having chemical weaponry, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said more than 20 nations have such weapons or the capability to produce them. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told reporters the smaller countries would be persuaded to join the ban because: `` I think you bring the force of public opinion to bear worldwide on any country that says that they're going to keep them and they're going to use them. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s national security adviser, <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would consider imposing economic sanctions against nations that refused to sign on to a treaty ban. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has condemned <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for using such weapons and said <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> was on the verge of production. Some officials suspect <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has a chemical weapons program. `` These horrible weapons are now finding their way into regional conflicts,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in his speech. `` This is unacceptable.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal came after two days of talks between <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> that produced agreement to hold a superpower summit next spring or summer. The two sides also agreed to exchange information about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet chemical weapons and conduct cross-inspections of arsenals. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in his speech heralded `` signs of a new attitude that prevails between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and U.S.S.R.'' `` Serious differences remain but the willingness to deal constructively and candidly with those differences is news that we and indeed the world must welcome,'' he said. The president said `` a new world of freedom'' is emerging around the globe. `` Today we are witnessing an ideological collapse, the demise of the totalitarian idea of the omniscient, all-powerful state,'' he said. Twice, as vice president, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> blocked legislation to destroy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chemical weapons by breaking a tie vote in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. But those would have been unilateral reductions, not tied to Soviet compliance. During his first trip to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> as president, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also met separately Monday with the presidents of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and Israeli Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahrens </PERSON>, then hosted a reception and dinner for diplomats and heads of state.

 Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said today that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will match <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reductions in chemical weapons and he challenged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to ban the devices completely plus halt nuclear testing. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will join the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and `` radically reduce or completely destroy'' all the chemical weapons it has stockpiled. But he also issued a new set of challenges. He said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will stop production of chemical weapons, halt nuclear tests and stop making weapons-grade plutonium and uranium _ all if <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> reciprocates. The speech was a prompt reply from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal Monday to drastically reduce chemical weapons stockpiles The proposal was given to the Soviets during the weekend and announced by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in his <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> address. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> offered an 80 percent cut in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chemical weapons stockpiles if the Soviets reciprocate. The delegates in the hall, including Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>, gave <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> a warm round of applause after his speech. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> met with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> foreign minister for about seven minutes after the speech, but declined to say what they talked about. He said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s speech was `` very responsive to the president's statement.'' He said he had to study it more closely but did not think the proposals went beyond those of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Speaking to delegates of 159 nations, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> `` is ready to reinstate its moratorium on all nuclear explosions any day and hour, if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reciprocates.'' <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has declared several such moratoriums, which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has declined to join. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the Soviets initiated such moratoriums after completing a series of tests. The Soviet foreign minister once again stressed disarmament, saying that `` if <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries agree to start talks on tactical nuclear weapons, the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION> will respond by further unilateral cuts in its tactical nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' He also proposed that the production of nuclear fissionable material for weapons be halted and that the ban be verified. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has announced that is halting the production of enriched uranium. In 1987 it closed one reactor producing weapons-grade plutonium, and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said `` we plan to close down in 1989 and 1990 a few more such reactors. By the year 2000 all the remaining reactors will have been shut down.'' He proposed that <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> safeguards be used for verification, and unilaterally offered to put one Soviet reactor under <ORGANIZATION> IAEA </ORGANIZATION> control `` to study the feasibility of full-scale verification.'' On chemical weapons, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said `` We welcome the proposal concerning chemical weapons put forward yesterday by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Generally consistent with the well-known initiatives of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leadership, it indicates to us that we share the desire to rid mankind of those barbaric weapons.'' He said `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is ready, together with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, to go further and assume mutual obligations prior to the conclusion of a multilateral convention'' currently being discussed by 40 nations meeting in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. The Soviet foreign minister said his nation would join <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in: _ Stopping the production of chemical weapons, including binary weapons, which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still manufactures _ Agreeing to `` radically reduce or completely destroy Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chemical weapons, regarding it as a step toward the global destruction of chemical weapons. _ `` Renounce the use of chemical weapons under any circumstances.'' _ `` Institute rigorous verification of the cessation of production of chemical warfare agents.'' `` I think that there is no need to say how beneficial that would be for the overall climate in the world,'' said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal, designed to spur a 40-nation conference in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to ban all chemical weapons within 10 years, would have the two superpowers reduce their stockpiles to a level equivalent to 20 percent of the current <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> level.

 The White House gave its endorsement today to a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> compromise for funding the war on drugs that would boost the president's plan by $ 900 million. Presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that, while some details of the bipartisan agreement still need to be worked out, the plan `` does appear consistent with our objectives.'' `` We do expect to accept this arrangement and hopefully we can get on with implementing the drug plan,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters. Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, earlier said the agreement is `` not a final solution, but it is a good first step toward fighting the war on drugs `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people wanted more than the president requested, and this gets more,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> told reporters in outlining the plan Monday night. The agreement, subject to final approval by a handful of key senators who were returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> today, would raise to $ 8.8 billion the anti-drug funds for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. It includes an across-the-board cut of about 0.43 percent in other federal programs to pay for the stepped-up drug war. Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., called the agreement on financing the plan `` fairly final. But he noted disagreements remained on when to take up separate legislation enacting parts of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s anti-crime package, including capital punishment and drug testing for those arrested on drug charges. Sen. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, R-Ore., the chief negotiator for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans, said the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had agreed to the plan in general terms <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was traveling Monday and had not analyzed the details of the proposed agreement, said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Roman Popadiuk. But if it proves consistent with news reports, `` then it may form a basis on which we may proceed,'' <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> said. The accord was expected to break a two-week logjam keeping four major spending bills from final <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passage: transportation; foreign aid; veterans, housing and space; and labor, health and education. But it appeared impossible for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pass in time all of the 13 spending bills needed to keep the government running after Sept. 30, and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> was expected today to approve a 25-day stopgap spending measure. The bill would continue the flow of cash to federal programs at current levels. The compromise anti-drug figure would be $ 900 million more than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sought in his Sept. 5 speech to the nation, and $ 3.1 billion more than is being spent on anti-drug programs in the current fiscal year. <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> had criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s request as too little to make headway against the drug scourge. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said the agreement would `` substantially improve the president's drug package'' and added he was `` gratified that the administration has agreed to support necessary funding for the drug program.'' While the compromise figure went a little less than halfway toward the $ 2.2 billion increase <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> originally proposed, nearly all of the increase _ $ 800 million _ would be devoted to drug treatment, education and prevention programs that <PERSON> Democrats </PERSON> said were most seriously underfunded in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s outline. <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> sought to minimize any Democratic advantage from the accord by pointing to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s leadership in proposing the anti-drug package in the first place. `` This is a bipartisan war,'' <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> said, adding that he expected many <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans to support the compromise package. `` The Democrats do n't have any greater degree of support for the drug war than the Republicans.'' Left unresolved were several legislative initiatives <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had proposed on habeas corpus and the death penalty to strengthen the prosecution of drug dealers. Those awaited talks with <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., who was out of town on Monday Discussions aimed at finding a compromise broke off on Friday after an apparent stalemate was reached. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, the chief <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> negotiator, complained that the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had been `` a shadow participant'' in the negotiations and was causing the breakdown. But <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> said <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> telephoned him Friday night and the two met on Saturday to begin putting the talks back on track. A substantial part of the compromise involved the mechanism to pay for the increased anti-drug programs. The across-the-board cut would hit most government programs equally, excluding Social Security and other federal benefits. That would mean a dent of about $ 1.3 billion in next year's $ 288.2 billion <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget But in the case of defense spending, the agreement allows the flexibility the administration had sought to allocate the cuts to areas where the pinch can be minimized. Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, the senior <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> member of the defense Appropriations subcommittee, said the cuts probably would be aimed at plans for new weapons procurement in order to protect crucial areas like personnel and military readiness, and weapons productions lines already in operation.

<TEXT>
 An East German emissary today told East Germans holed up in the West German Embassy that they can legally emigrate to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> but first must return home, a spokesmen for the refugees said. <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> arrived today to speak to representatives of about 1,200 East Germans who have crowded the garden of the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in hopes of obtaining safe passage to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. After meeting with <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, between 50 and 60 East Germans boarded a bus that reportedly took them to a <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> railroad station for their journey back to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The others, however, remained in the embassy quarters and it was unclear if they refused the East German offer. <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> is an <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> lawyer who has close contacts with the East German leadership. Refugees who took part in the negotiations told reporters waiting outside the embassy that <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> gave them a personal guarantee they could emigrate once they returned home. Already, more than 20,000 East Germans have fled to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, which incensed <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders when it opened its border to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> on Sept. 11. In <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, dozens of other East Germans arrived Monday outside the closed <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> to seek passage to the West. Some said they swam rivers by night or walked through forests on the Polish-East German border. In <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, a Western reporter on Monday afternoon witnessed some 40 new arrivals scale the 7-foot fence of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> Embassy in the conspicuous absence of Czechoslovak police who had earlier patrolled the street outside, urging reporters to leave. By nightfall, the number of East Germans holed up inside the compound had reached around 980, refugees reported. Some said they'd had to spend Sunday night in the open air for lack of <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> tents, but new tents arrived during the day. In the area near the embassy, police have towed away all East German cars. `` The situation is getting ever more difficult,'' said a 40-year-old East German, who, like all the others, asked for anonymity. He said that his wife and children had successfully made it to the West via <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, but he himself was intercepted by Czechoslovak border guards as he drove in his car toward the Czechoslovak-Hungarian frontier. Other would-be refugees were also caught. Fearing imprisonment at home, he told a reporter, `` Where else should I have gone? The <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> was the last way out.'' Those camping in the embassy garden are mostly people aged 30-40, but there are also 200 children including several infants. There was hardly any space left to put up new tents. In <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, at least 300 East Germans are being accommodated, either in a group of <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> houses in the villa district of <LOCATION> Saska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kepa </LOCATION> or in a park-surrounded former seminary in <LOCATION> Tarchomin </LOCATION>, just outside <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. The embassy was closed to the public last week to prevent more refugees from entering. The East Germans were anxious to be allowed onto embassy grounds on Monday, but guards stood inside the locked gates. However, embassy officers after making an announcement in the afternoon could be seen escorting small groups away from the embassy, presumably to a shelter for the night. A tall young East German who identified himself as <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, 23, described his escape from his homeland. He said he blew up an air mattress, placed his belongings on it and then swam with the mattress across the <LOCATION> Neisse </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> that forms the Polish-East German border in southwest <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Water Damage Expected to Have Little Impact on Space Shuttle Launch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Water damage to <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> is less than originally thought, and the shuttle has a good chance to meet its December launch target, the director of the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. `` It certainly does not have the dimensions of doom we were concerned about'' after fire protection water drenched <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday, <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> said in an interview. `` We've not really assessed what the impact will be on the launch date, but my personal assessment on it right now is that it will be minimal, if any,'' he said. `` Sunday we had a very bad day, and we had a very gloomy outlook, but it's Tuesday morning, and, while we see some additional work to be done, we feel that work can be accomplished,'' he said. The accident occurred as three workers were performing routine maintenance on the fire sprinkler system in the hangar where <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> is being readied for a Dec. 18 launch. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> reported a valve in one sprinkler head failed, causing a leakage of water. Two other workers, in their haste to stop the flow, inadvertantly turned on other sprinklers, and several thousand gallons of water poured onto work platforms and the shuttle. Other workers were able to shut off the water after several minutes. `` I'm chalking it up to a combination of equipment error and human error,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Utsman </PERSON>, deputy director of the space center and head of a team investigating the incident. <PERSON> Utsman </PERSON> said Monday that as many as 200 of the shuttle's 500 woven fiberglass heat shields might have been damaged by the soaking and might have to be replaced. But <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> said Tuesday the number was closer to 70 or 80 and that most of them were off the shuttle, sitting to the side on racks. They had been removed to give technicians access to a series of steering jets in the spaceship's nose. <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> said there had been some concern that damage might have occurred to <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s electrical system, but when power was turned on Tuesday morning, there were no problems detected. `` The system has to be flexible enough to accept these disruptions,'' <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> said. `` I do n't want to downplay the problem, but I think we are professional enough and flexible enough to cope with this one.'' <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s crew of five is to deploy a communications satellite and retrieve for return to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> a scientific payload that has been orbiting for more than five years. Two prior shuttle missions are scheduled. Atlantis is to carry the Galileo-Jupiter probe into space on Oct. 12 and Discovery is being groomed for a Nov. 19 liftoff with a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> payload.

<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> said Tuesday he is asking the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to review an appellate decision upholding a law that stripped governors of their veto power over <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> training missions. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> enacted the law, known as the Montgomery Amendment, after several governors in 1985 and 1986 objected to deployment of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> personnel on maneuvers in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, where the governors felt there was a danger of involvement in wars. The law `` presents a states' rights issue of historical importance,'' <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` Because of conflicting decisions in the lower courts, this issue warrants a final resolution by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> said he has never disapproved of any federal training deployment of the <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, but is challenging the law's constitutionality because it invades on a governor's authority <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> initially challenged the Montgomery Amendment on Jan. 28, 1987. The amendment to a 1986 defense bill says governors may not withhold their consent to <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> missions `` because of any objection to the location, purpose, type or schedule of such active duty.'' The amendment was upheld in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, but a three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled it was unconstitutional. At the request of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, the full 8th Circuit considered the matter and, on June 28, it held 7-2 that the law is constitutional. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s lawsuit contends the law violates the Militia Clause of the Constitution, which reserves to states authority to direct or consent to peacetime training of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. A statement issued Tuesday by the office of the amendment's author, Rep. G.V <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, D-Miss., said the case already has been argued `` exhaustively. `` The courts have ruled the amendment to be constitutional,'' <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said. `` It's time now to let the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> get back to the business of training and away from the courtroom. It would be a terrible mistake to deny our Guard personnel the chance to train in real world conditions that ca n't be duplicated at bases in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Tunheim </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s chief deputy attorney general, said a decision from the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on whether it will hear the case is expected in two to three months. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to hear a similar challenge to the law, filed by <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and rejected by the 1st <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, should have no bearing on whether the high court considers <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s challenge, <PERSON> Tunheim </PERSON> said. `` That case was not nearly as well-developed as the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> case,'' <PERSON> Tunheim </PERSON> said. The 1st Circuit issued a one-sentence order affirming the law, while the decisions in the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> case have prompted lengthy dissents, <PERSON> Tunheim </PERSON> said.

Last spring, the old school board, composed of three whites and two blacks, voted to name the new school for King. But a newly elected board with only one black member designated it Motley Elementary, for the land's former owner, saying it wanted a name that was not racially identifiable. The school is more than 95 percent black.

<HEAD>Game and Fish Officials Open Hearings on Returning Ferrets to the
Wild</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEETEETSE, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The populaton of black-footed ferrets, once believed extinct is growing in captive breeding and eventually the animals will be set free in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s high plains. This week the state Game and <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is holding hearings in <LOCATION> Meeteetse </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cody </PERSON> and <PERSON> Casper </PERSON> to discuss a reintroduction plan that could see the first of the small, masked mammals released into the wild by 1991. Four years ago, an epidemic of canine distemper nearly wiped out the only known colony of the nocturnal, weasel-like creatures, and wildlife biologists trapped the last 18 for a captive breeding program. The program centered at the department's <ORGANIZATION> Sybille </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION> facility has boosted the known population of ferrets to some 120. This week's hearings will draw public comment on plans to return some of the ferrets to the plains surrounding Meeteetse, where they were found in 1981 after being considered extinct. `` It's only right,'' said town recreation director <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON>, who keeps in his office <PERSON> Meeteetse </PERSON>'s only remaining black-footed ferret _ stuffed. But some objectives must be met before reintroduction. Scientists are working on a vaccine to immunize the animals against distemper, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorne </PERSON>, a state veterinarian who directed the breeding project. And the ferrets must be taught how to kill prairie dogs, their natural prey. To help the animals learn, Game and Fish has built caged, outdoor prairie dog colonies. But there's no fear that captive-bred ferrets wo n't recognize predators that can kill them, said <PERSON> Thorne </PERSON>. `` If anything, they are wilder and more afraid of us than the wild-caught ferrets,'' he said. `` My hope is that they're going to regard everything except prairie dogs as a predator.'' Critics worry that human activity _ particularly the area's ranching and oil industries _ will be a bigger problem <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> has proposed drilling a well a few miles from prime ferret habitat, and a public hearing on that proposal is scheduled Thursday in <LOCATION> Meeteetse </LOCATION>. But Pitchfork Ranch manager <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Turnell </PERSON>, 43, a member of an advisory board on the ferret program, said he has `` zero concern'' about drilling. `` The ferret does n't give a damn about people or machinery or cattle or anything else,'' said <PERSON> Turnell </PERSON>. `` There's only one thing they care about _ that's a food source.'' <PERSON> Turnell </PERSON> said scientists want him to persuade other ranchers to let ferrets be introduced into prairie dog towns on their ranches. But the ranchers are afraid, `` not of ferrets, but of bureaucrats and environmentalists because they go overboard with their rules and regulations,'' he said. Wildlife officials hope to ease that fear by having the reintroduced ferrets declared a `` non-essential experimental population'' under the Endangered Species Act. That would lift restrictions that protect every individual of a threatened species and reduce bureaucratic reaction to ferret deaths.

 <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> arrived for Day 12 of her cop-slapping trial complaining she was late because the `` gorgeous'' policeman who arrested her in June was working a speed trap on <LOCATION> Sunset </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION>. `` Officer -LRB- <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> made me late. He stopped the traffic with a radar gun. There he was, looking his gorgeous self, with radar,'' Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> told reporters when she reached the courthouse at 9 a.m. Municipal Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> on Monday had declared the trial was taking too long and ordered that sessions start an hour early, at 8:45 a.m. The former Hungarian beauty queen is on trial on misdemeanor charges stemming from her June 14 arrest by <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>, who stopped her <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> for having an expired registration. Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> said her mother, <PERSON> Jolie </PERSON>, and older sister <PERSON> Magda </PERSON> would be in courtroom for the afternoon session. She said she spent extra time picking an outfit to please her. `` Mother's very critical,'' Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> said. `` They're going to sit here for support.'' The trial, now in its third week, has cost taxpayers an estimated $ 22,000 and provided fodder for journalists around the world. They have dutifully reported Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>'s sometimes outrageous statements, which at one point drew a reprimand from the judge for failing to heed his gag order. On Monday, Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> retracted an out-of-court remark that she was afraid to go to jail because lesbians were there. `` I have nothing against gays or lesbians. I have lots of gay boys working for me,'' the actress told reporters. `` I got letter from the lesbians and gay association. They are going to boycott me because I said there are lesbians in jail.'' The trial originally was expected to last a week. Defense attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Graysen </PERSON> said new witnesses located over the weekend could extend it until Friday. In court, a defense witness Monday supported Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>'s account that she slapped <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> in self-defense `` That man was after blood I think,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Katzman </PERSON>, a free-lance screenwriter who has written for `` Knots Landing'' and `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Katzman </PERSON> said he stopped his car when he noticed the unusual sight of a policeman pulling over a white <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corniche </ORGANIZATION>, and became concerned as he watched. `` The lady looked as if she was going to be threatened and as though she would be hurt,'' he testified. Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> could receive up to 18 months in jail if convicted of misdemeanor battery on a police officer, disobeying an officer's orders, driving with an expired license and having an open container of alcohol in her car

<HEAD>Survey: Student Cocaine Users Getting Higher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A survey of almost 400,000 junior high and high school students nationwide found that the percentage using drugs has dropped in the past two years, but those who use cocaine are getting higher. `` I'm discouraged that the levels of intoxication are increasing,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleaton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parents </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday in announcing the survey results. The percentage of students in grades 9-12 who said they use cocaine dropped from 6.4 percent in 1986-87 to 4.6 percent in the 1988-89 school year. However, those users who reported getting `` very high `` or `` bombed @ stoned'' from the drug rose from 71.4 percent to 74.5 percent over the two-year period, according to the PRIDE survey. In the junior high grades of 6-8, 1.7 percent of the students said they had used cocaine in the past year, a drop from 2.3 percent in 1986-87. But 68.2 percent of those users said they got `` very high'' or `` bombed @ stoned,'' compared with 65.2 percent in the earlier survey. The drop in the percentage of students who said they used cocaine `` means the casual user is more careful, more frightened of the drug,'' <PERSON> Gleaton </PERSON> said. Outlining a profile of the student cocaine user, <PERSON> Gleaton </PERSON> described a `` venturesome'' and `` sociable'' youth who `` wants to be first. ... He's got a wonderful little ego.'' Although the use of beer, liquor, marijuana and cocaine showed declines from the 1986-87 survey for students in grades 6-12, levels of junior high students' use of liquor and cocaine remained higher than they were in the 1984-85 survey. The percentage of students in grades 6-8 who said they used liquor was 21.2 percent in 1984-85, peaked at 26.3 percent two years ago and dropped to 24.9 percent in the latest survey. The percentage who said they used cocaine was 1.3 percent four years ago, peaked at 2.3 percent two years ago and dropped to 1.7 percent in the new study. In addition, the latest survey detected weekly cocaine use in the sixth grade. Of the 29,116 sixth graders who responded to a question about cocaine use, 0.8 percent, or about 233, said they used cocaine weekly or daily. About 58 sixth graders said they used cocaine once or twice a month, and another 87 said they used cocaine one to six times a year. For junior high students, of the 161,907 who answered the cocaine question, 0.7 percent or 1,133 said they used it weekly or daily; an equal number used it infrequently and 648 said they used it once or twice a month. `` Whereas we have seen some drops -LRB- in drug use -RRB- at the upper grades, at the lower grades there is an alarming trend of more use,'' compared with four years earlier, said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, vice president of PRIDE. <PERSON> Gleaton </PERSON> said the reduced levels among high schoolers may reflect that those who start using drugs early drop out of school and therefore were not surveyed. The survey covered 392,003 students in grades 6 to 12 who answered an anonymous questionnaire given in 958 schools in 38 states. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said the survey represented a cross-section of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, from inner cities to rural areas, but it was not a scientific, random selection of students. Cigarette smoking gained popularity among all levels of students surveyed, with 38.7 percent of high school students and 28.1 percent of junior high students saying they had smoked a cigarette, increases over both two and four years ago. <PERSON> Gleaton </PERSON> said that might be because the public is `` focusing so much now on crack, on cocaine ... on drugs,'' that less attention is paid to cigarettes. The educational level and employment status of parents did not differ widely between cocaine-using high school seniors and those who abstain, the survey found. `` In fact, the parents of cocaine-using students were slightly better-educated,'' the study said.

 Former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> today refused to answer questions from a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee investigating scandals at the agency during his eight-year tenure, citing his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, appearing before the subcommittee under a subpoena, said criticism of him by members of the panel `` leads me to the painful conclusion that I have been prejudged by this body.'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> made the dramatic announcement in a brief opening statement to the subcommittee. At his insistence, television cameras and photography equipment were barred during <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s appearance The subcommittee chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, then posed a series of eight questions to <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> regarding his tenure at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, and each time <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> refused to answer, citing his constitutional rights. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> may have waived his rights not to answer by testifying voluntarily before the same committee in May. But <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said he would not rule immediately on that question as chairman and told <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s lawyers to submit written arguments on the constitutional question within a week. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., also said he would again urge current <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> to cooperate with <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s request under the Freedom of Information Act for <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> documents <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> refused to answer questions from reporters as he left the hearing room. His attorney, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perito </PERSON>, said he hoped <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> would be ready to testify on Oct. 27, the next time the subpoena requires him to appear. `` This man is an innocent man,'' <PERSON> Perito </PERSON> said. `` This man wants very much to tell his story.'' Among the questions <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> put to <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> were ones about his approval, over the objection of other <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials, of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> funds for an elderly housing project in <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> also asked <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> to explain an announcement by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> of the awarding of a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> grant for elderly housing in <LOCATION> Ewing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, during a campaign appearance in 1982 on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Millicent </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenwick </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> questioned how that announcement was consistent with <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s previous contention that the housing program was not run on a political basis <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> ended his questioning, saying, `` It is obvious the witness ... is determined to invoke his Fifth Amendment prerogative.'' Rep. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> `` Buz'' <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, the ranking Republican on the panel, told <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, `` I am truly disappointed and frustrated'' by his refusal to testify. Virtually every member of the panel said that they hoped <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> would agree to testify, but said even before he spoke that they expected him to invoke his constitutional right against self-incrimination. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> was originally scheduled to testify on Sept. 15 but refused to appear, saying he had just hired an attorney and was not ready. The subcommittee then subpoenaed <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> and demanded that he appear today. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> showed up as scheduled, but after being sworn in as a witness read a brief statement in which he said he would not answer questions because he still had not had enough time to prepare. He also said he had determined that the committee would not grant him a fair hearing. `` Under these circumstances, my counsel has advised me to assert my constitutional rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments by refusing to answer questions,'' he said. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s appearance came after an angry exchange between his attorneys and <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>. <PERSON> Perito </PERSON> had objected to having three lawmakers who are not members of the subcommittee present at the hearing. When <PERSON> Perito </PERSON> asked that those three be barred from asking questions, <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said that, under <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s attorneys had no right to speak but only to advise <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. `` In this hearing, you are in fact a potted plant,'' <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> told <PERSON> Perito </PERSON>. That was a reference to the 1987 Iran-Contra hearings, when <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, forcefully told a different investigating committee, `` I am not a potted plant.'' During a round of lengthy opening statements, lawmakers criticized <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> for refusing to appear voluntarily and suggested he was reluctant to testify because he had something to hide. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> also dismissed <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s contention that he would not be treated fairly. `` We are not engaged in a punitive mission,'' <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Perito </PERSON> told reporters later, however, that he still believed the subcommittee had a vendetta against <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. `` What they want to do is rush him to judgment. They want to try, convict and sentence him, and we will not let that occur,'' <PERSON> Perito </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said that by seeking delays and forcing the committee to subpoena him, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> was playing `` a game of legal hide and seek'' to avoid testifying about problems at the agency he headed for the eight years of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> refused to answer questions after insisting that no television cameras, still photographers or radio reporters be allowed to record or photograph his testimony. House rules allow subpoeaned witnesses to ask for such restrictions on media coverage and <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> refused when <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> asked him to reconsider the request. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> testified in May that he was not a `` hands-on'' manager, and he also told reporters that some of his aides had apparently betrayed him. Since then, however, several former deputies challenged <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s account that he was not directly involved in major funding decisions Agency records disclosed since then also show a greater <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> role in major decisions than he indicated. Neither the testimony nor the records, however, suggest any wrongdoing by <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>.

 A twin-engine commuter plane trying to land in heavy fog crashed and burned today, killing all seven people aboard, authorities said. The <ORGANIZATION> Skylink </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> plane en route from <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> went down in the woods near the airport here with five passengers and two crew members, authorities said. `` What we know at this stage is the weather conditions were very bad and that the airport was covered with fog,'' said <PERSON> Christiane </PERSON> <PERSON> Cote </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s transportation department. `` Therefore visibility was minimal. `` The pilot attempted to land one time and decided to abort his attempt and was presumably on his way to try a second attempt to land when the plane crashed.'' Terrace is about 435 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>. The plane operated by the Vancouver-based airline was capable of carrying 18 passengers. `` We got a call from air radio requesting us to help locate the crash scene,'' said <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Swan </PERSON>, who piloted the helicopter that pinpointed the wreck. `` It was patchy cloud over the area so I could n't see much. I saw the smoke, though. I directed the ground crews to it.''

 A highly decorated police officer who has difficulty reading because of a learning disability has won his battle to have someone read him the test he must pass to be promoted to sergeant. Officer <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Spanos </PERSON>' first request for a reader was rejected last week. <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Herndon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s assistant personnel administrator, noted that <PERSON> Spanos </PERSON> had passed the written test without a reader two years ago and would be given ample time to complete it this time. But Monday, after <PERSON> Spanos </PERSON> challenged the decision with help from an advocate for the disabled, <PERSON> Herndon </PERSON> said a reader would be made available for the test Sunday. `` I feel relieved,'' <PERSON> Spanos </PERSON> said. `` I do n't know why they made me jump through the hoops. If I had n't enlisted the help of an advocate, I wonder where I would be.'' He said the fact that he had passed the test without a reader should not have been used as grounds to deny him one now. <PERSON> Spanos </PERSON>, 41, a 17-year police veteran and the county's most decorated officer, has dyslexia, a disability that makes it difficult for him to read and write some words. That did not stop him from graduating from college. Because of dyslexia, he was held back a grade in school, and a police department supervisor once sent him to class with elementary children to improve his reading and writing, he said. `` I have to memorize words,'' he said. `` There are times when I simply do n't recall a word and I try to put it in context and sometimes I get it wrong. Also, there are times I read a word and the letters run together or when I write, I leave a letter out.'' Four years ago, he said, he narrowly flunked the written part of the sergeant's test, disqualifying him from the promotional list. Two years later, he passed the test and other requirements to be placed on the qualifying list. But the county decided not to fill all of the sergeant vacancies because there were no minorities on the list. The list expires every two years. `` I felt disappointed, extremely frustrated and angry,'' <PERSON> Spanos </PERSON> said. `` I think it is worth taking a chance. I am not a rookie any more. If this comes back to haunt me, so be it. Maybe someone else will benefit in the future.'' <PERSON> Spanos </PERSON> enlisted the help of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ardinger </PERSON>, an instructor of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government at <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> who is a member of the county's <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Disability Issues and a co-founder of the advocacy group Disabled in Action. <PERSON> Ardinger </PERSON> said he was `` taken aback'' by the original denial. `` It was such a reasonable request for this kind of disability. There is no question Officer <PERSON> Spanos </PERSON> is entitled to this accommodation,'' he said.

 Country musician <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> says he organized a benefit concert to aid cleanup of the Alaskan oil spill because he believes <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> has reneged on its promise to restore the area. Besides <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, other performers slated to appear Wednesday at <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>'s Center Stage include <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON>, <PERSON> J.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON>, <PERSON> Maura </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jonelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosser </PERSON>, New Grass Revival and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Hobo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, whose new album is titled `` This Little Town,'' said Monday he was moved by the plight of the wildlife and people living along the hundreds of miles of shoreline soiled by the spill. Nearly 11 million gallons of oil poured into Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> after the tanker Exxon Valdez struck a reef on March 24. The bodies of more than 30,000 birds and about 1,000 animals have been found. Biologists say those figures probably represent only 5 percent to 10 percent of the deaths caused by the spill. `` When I found out about this I became concerned, more than concerned. I became extremely angry about it,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` Their economy was shot to hell because of this. Everyone needed money so bad. Fishermen have lost their boats because they missed the fishing season.'' <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spent at least $ 1.2 billion on the cleanup before stopping its efforts earlier this month because of worsening weather and dwindling daylight. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said the state would conduct a $ 21 million program `` to continue cleanup work left by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> has said it will re-evaluate the shorelines next spring and decide then whether to resume the cleanup on a large scale. `` One of the main things we are trying to do is keep this before the public's attention to keep pressure on <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> to keep their promise and clean it up,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. The concert is expected to raise $ 16,000 to $ 20,000, 95 percent of which will go to the <ORGANIZATION> Prince </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sound </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cleanup </ORGANIZATION> and Rehabilitation Fund administered by the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. Only the cost of printing and selling the $ 20-per-person tickets was not donated, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. The money will be used to help wildlife and clean the area. The <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> is a 10-year-old, non-profit group that pays for environmental education and policy studies. Rounding up artists for the concert was n't difficult, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` Most of the people I have asked are pretty much concerned people, concerned about the environment, period,'' he said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> is offering to return to the Zuni Indians a statue that the university museum displayed for a year before learning that the tribe considers it offensive to display the sacred piece.

The university's <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> placed the statue in storage about two years ago after a visitor from the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> told officials about its significance.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted overwhelmingly today to back a federal commission's decision to shut down 86 military bases and scale down five more as lawmakers weighed a $ 228.2 billion military spending bill. By a vote of 86-14, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved an amendment that effectively kills a provision that would have withheld $ 300 million to close the bases until an audit found that the savings from shutting down the installations would exceed the cost. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said that further cuts in the defense budget by the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may force him to close more bases. The audit would have been conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're just asking that the comptroller general analyze. Otherwise these bases have no appeal,'' Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, said on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor in support of the amendment. `` There is no <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. This is the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.'' But Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, argued against undermining the commission's recommendations, which were approved by former Secretary of Defense <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and upheld in the House. `` If we set a precedent now that you can re-open the package, I'm fearful future commissions wo n't be as effective,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said. The commission, in issuing its recommendation last year, estimated savings of $ 5.6 billion over 20 years. Since the commission's announcement last December, lawmakers whose home-state bases would be affected complained that the panel based its selection on inaccurate or incomplete data. Prior to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> met on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> with lawmakers from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> who made a last-ditch appeal to save <ORGANIZATION> Chanute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Rantoul </LOCATION>, Ill. The session did not change plans to close <LOCATION> Chanute </LOCATION>, 120 miles south of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` Given all the demands to redirect dollars from the defense budget to other areas, I've got no choice but to find ways to close additional bases,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> told reporters the day after <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats and the administration reached a tentative agreement to boost President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s anti-drug effort by $ 900 million. The drug plan requires a cut of about $ 1.3 billion in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget. On the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor, Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill., criticized the recommendations made last year by the `` faceless, nameless members of the commission. `` They cooked the books,'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said, waving a copy of a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report that had found problems in the commission's report. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> is an investigative agency of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Residents and businesses in several <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> counties and cities near <LOCATION> Chanute </LOCATION> pooled their money to hire an influential lobbying firm to argue for <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>'s measure. The cost for hiring <PERSON> Patton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> and Blow is estimated at about $ 30,000. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also was weighing legislation that cuts President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s request for Star Wars and the Trident 2 missile, but leaves other strategic programs relatively intact. Among the major provisions of the spending bill are: _ A cut of about $ 800 million from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s $ 4.9 billion proposal for the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and fellow Republican Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> plan to introduce an amendment to raise the spending level for Star Wars. _ Elimination of all $ 1.8 billion for procurement of the Trident 2 missile and an increase of $ 70 million to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s request of $ 216 million for research and development of the submarine-launched weapons The Trident 2 missile suffered two successive failures in undersea test firings one month before the committee action. _ A requirement that $ 820 million of the $ 3.7 billion for Star Wars be used for research on lasers and particle beams Sen. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, D-La., sponsor of the amendment, expressed concerns that the administration will sacrifice long-term research on directed energy weapons in favor of a quick deployment along the lines of the `` Brilliant Pebbles'' scheme favored by many in the administration _ Provisions similar to those in an earlier authorization bill, with most of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s strategic programs left intact, including the MX and <LOCATION> Midgetman </LOCATION> nuclear missiles and the B-2 stealth bomber The spending plan also accepts the president's decision to cancel the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s F-14D jet fighter. _ Earmarking $ 255 million for the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> to test the V-22 Osprey, a vertical-takeoff plane the administration sought to cancel

 Former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> refused to answer questions Tuesday from a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel investigating housing scandals, citing his constitutional right against self-incrimination. He contended he had been `` prejudged by this body.'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, compelled to appear by a subpoena, accused the subcommittee of trying to rush him into testifying without adequate preparation and said he hoped to tell his story later. His refusal to testify came at a dramatic meeting of a panel that has been investigating allegations of billions of dollars worth of fraud, mismanagement, influence peddling and political favoritism at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> headed throughout the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Disagreements between the subcommittee and <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> even extended to news coverage of the hearing. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> invoked <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules that forced subcommittee chairman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., to bar television, radio and photographic coverage, despite the chairman's complaint that the move was <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> read a brief statement saying he had not had time to prepare, did not have the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> documents he needed and would invoke his constitutional right not to testify. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> then posed eight questions to <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, some raising new suggestions of political influence involving <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House. Each time <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> refused to answer. `` The subcommittee's desire to rush me through this process, together with various statements made by members ... leads me to the painful conclusion that I have been prejudged by this body,'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said. `` Under these circumstances, my counsel has advised me and I have agreed to assert my constitutional rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments by refusing to answer questions before this subcommittee,'' he said. `` I trust this subcommittee will remember that these rights are intended as shields for the innocent and that they do not create any inference or presumption of wrongdoing.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perito </PERSON>, his attorney, said he hoped <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> would be ready to testify on Oct. 27, the next date he has been ordered before the employment and housing subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Perito </PERSON>, outside the committee room, told reporters the subcommittee wanted would n't give <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> a fair hearing and wanted to `` rush him to judgment.'' `` They want to try, convict and sentence him, and we will not let that occur,'' <PERSON> Perito </PERSON> said. `` This man is an innocent man. ... This man wants very much to tell his story.'' <PERSON> Perito </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> engaged in a brief but heated exchange after the lawyer attempted to challenge the presence of three lawmakers who are not members of the subcommittee. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said that under <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s attorneys had no right to speak but only to advise their client. `` In this hearing, you are in fact a potted plant,'' <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> told <PERSON> Perito </PERSON> _ a remark that recalled the 1987 Iran-Contra hearings when <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, told a different investigating committee, `` I am not a potted plant,'' something to be ignored. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> himself cited public comments about a need for a special prosecutor, as well as comments by panel members alleging inconsistencies in his voluntary testimony last May, as evidence he had been prejudged. However, Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> had thrown `` roadblocks in the way of the truth coming out. ... The longer he does it, the more he digs himself into a hole.'' A Republican on the subcommittee, Rep. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shays </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, said before the hearing that if <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> refused to testify he would support calling for the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the former secretary. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said after the meeting he was studying the issue. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> delivered the same response to each of the eight questions posed to him, a brief sentence citing his rights and his attorney's advice. He sat expressionless, facing the panel. As members criticized his refusal to testify, he occasionally closed his eyes and shook his head slightly. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> may have waived his rights not to answer by testifying voluntarily before the same subcommittee in May. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> told <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s lawyers to submit written arguments on the question within a week. Among the questions <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> put to <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> were ones about his approval, over the objection of other <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials, of money for a housing project for elderly people in <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lantos </LOCATION> also asked <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> to explain an announcement by then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> of the awarding of a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> grant for housing for the elderly during a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> campaign appearance in 1982 on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Millicent </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenwick </PERSON>. The congressman questioned how that announcement was consistent with <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s statement in his May testimony that the housing program was not run on a political basis. ` I ca n't see how it could be any more political,'' <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> showed copies of a Sept. 17, 1982, memo in which <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> was informed by a deputy that `` the president, who is en route to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, has agreed to fund, with Section 8 new construction funds,'' the 125-unit housing project for <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. The subcommittee chairman said the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> units were taken away from the <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION> project, which was later financed anyway. The memo bears <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s initials and the handwritten word `` noted.'' <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> also showed a report on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s appearance the following day in the <ORGANIZATION> Trenton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. The account said the project's developer did n't know <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> had approved the project until seeing it on an evening news program, and it quoted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as saying after his announcement, `` If you do n't elect her as senator we'll take it away.

 Police are guarding public buildings following a week-long series of suspicious fires and telephone threats against schools and school officials. `` This might be related to our attempt to break up a drug pipeline at the school earlier this year,'' said School Superintendent <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON>. `` There was an attempt -LRB- by drug dealers -RRB- to get a foothold in it, and we've worked very hard to eliminate drugs,'' he said. French also speculated the fires could be reprisals against administrators for the expulsion of a gun-toting 14-year-old male student several weeks ago. `` We had a student expelled because he brought his father's gun to school with the intent to kill another student,'' he said. He declined to identify the minor. French said the student fired one shot that hit a portable classroom. `` The consensus is that the fires are all connected,'' said state chief deputy fire marshal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamblee </PERSON> of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` It's giving us indications that someone has a vendetta or a loose screw,'' he said of the investigation, adding that his office will post a $ 1,000 reward. Monday morning, someone pushed a burning wad of paper behind a ceiling tile at the county's temporary welfare office downtown. The fire did little damage and was being investigated as arson, said <LOCATION> Hazlehurst </LOCATION> Public Safety Director <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Quarles </PERSON>. Another fire early Sunday gutted a vacant building being rented by <PERSON> Woodrow </PERSON> <PERSON> Purcer </PERSON>, a candidate in a special election for supervisor, <PERSON> Quarles </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Quarles </PERSON> said the fire is believed to be also arson-related. <PERSON> Purcer </PERSON> said: `` It had nothing to do with the election; it just happened.'' Four fires set at <ORGANIZATION> Hazlehurst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hazlehurst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> early Thursday and a fire that demolished the <ORGANIZATION> Copiah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> early Friday were under investigation as arson, police said. Authorities said there are no suspects. French said he received a series of telephone threats Sunday night from a woman who threatened to `` destroy the schools'' and kill him. `` This is the first time that I have confirmed that this is a vendetta,'' French said, adding that he believes the threats and fires are the result of a grudge against the school administration. `` In the second call, they said for me to meet them somewhere, and they were going to kill me ... nothing but me,'' he said. `` And in the third call, they said they were going to kill me and just hung up.'' A bomb squad combed the campuses and the athletic field for explosives before a home football game on Friday, French said. French said authorities are working around the clock to protect the campuses. And <PERSON> Quarles </PERSON> said city and county law officers are guarding public buildings from dusk to dawn.

 Relatives rushed across the border from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> on Tuesday to greet their sons, fathers and husbands returning from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s nearly 11-year-old war in the neighboring country. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> said the withdrawal marked the end of its military involvement in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, but guerrillas claim thousands of Vietnamese soldiers remain, wearing Cambodian uniforms. Schoolchildren, peasants and city dwellers lined Highway 1, waving flags and tree branches at the thousands of passing troops in a government-orchestrated welcoming ceremony. `` My wife is more beautiful now than ever,'' one soldier said as he held hands with his spouse, who dashed the last few yards to embrace her husband. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> had promised it would have all of its 26,000 troops out of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by Sept. 26, and the withdrawal sparked fears that <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> will slide into protracted civil war as government troops try to fight the three-party guerrilla coalition without Vietnamese help. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s invasion in December 1978 ousted the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> regime, which had ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> since 1975. During that time, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> killed hundreds of thousands, practicing a radical brand of agrarian communism. Now the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> is the strongest of the three-party guerrilla front. Guerrilla radio reports monitored in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> on Tuesday claimed resistance forces had seized two more areas in a gem-rich region in western <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, killing some Vietnamese troops in the fighting. Cambodian Defense Minister Tea Banh recently confirmed that guerrillas held some areas near <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION>. At <LOCATION> Moc </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bai </LOCATION>, a Vietnamese cultural troop serenaded hundreds of soldiers with popular tunes as they sat in a football-field size buffer zone between the two countries. Several military officers gave patriotic speeches, praising the `` solidarity of the Vietnamese and Cambodian peoples.'' Then, with the whine of a motorcycle siren, the convoy began. Led by an American-made jeep and Soviet-made armored personnel carriers, the soldiers scurried into trucks and roared home, followed by trucks of their comrades. `` I am so happy to be leaving <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>,'' a soldier from Can <PERSON> Tho </PERSON> province said as his 3-year-old daughter tugged at his hair. Many men said they were worried that after receiving a hero's welcome, they will have trouble finding jobs <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> has demobilized more than a half-million soldiers in recent years, Gen. <PERSON> Tran </PERSON> <PERSON> Cong </PERSON> <PERSON> Man </PERSON>, editor of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s official army newspaper, said in a recent interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Unemployment is also high. Freshly painted posters praising <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s army lined Highway 1. The narrow, potholed highway was one of the main invasion routes used by Vietnamese troops almost 11 years ago when they poured into <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. In addition to the 10,000 troops at <LOCATION> Moc </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bai </LOCATION>, Vietnamese soldiers crossed over at port towns on the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and at several other locations overland. Logistics and artillery divisions, along with wounded soldiers, crossed the border at <LOCATION> Samat </LOCATION>, several miles north of <LOCATION> Moc </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bai </LOCATION>. Tanks and armored personnel carriers arrived at the port town of <LOCATION> Rach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gai </LOCATION>. Outside of <PERSON> Moc </PERSON> <PERSON> Bai </PERSON>, the convoy stopped and started as local villagers crowded around the trucks to cheer the soldiers. At Go <PERSON> Dau </PERSON>, a toothless farmer ran to one truck and tossed the soldiers packets of rice and pork wrapped in banana leaves. `` Thank you, grandfather,'' one soldier said. Many of the troops had spent the night on Highway 1, sleeping under trucks. State-run television Tuesday night devoted a lengthy program to the pullout as did the newspaper of the Vietnamese <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. In an editorial the paper said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s `` special'' relationship with <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> would continue. <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance groups have claimed <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> wants to colonize <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Ho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, Vietnamese government officials confirmed that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> would renegotiate their treaty of `` peace and friendship,'' imposed on the Cambodian government soon after it was installed in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>. The treaty, which is basically a mutual defense pact, conflicts with <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s stated goal of neutrality. Cambodian Prime Minister <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> had earlier said he hoped the treaty would be renegotiated soon. However, the officials said such renegotiation would not affect Vietnamese military support of the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government. They said such support, through arms transfers, advice and intelligence, would last as long as nations such as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> continue to support the guerrilla resistance front. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s main arms supplier.

<HEAD>No Agreement on Catastrophic Insurance Repeal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> found no agreement Tuesday on a new plan to prevent repeal of catastrophic medical insurance for retirees. `` There obviously is not bipartisan support for any proposal at this point,'' committee chairman Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, told reporters after a closed session. `` The administration says it is for the -LRB- new -RRB- package but I do n't see any Republican members for the package,'' he said. Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, R-Minn., said he saw signs members might be drawing closer to a compromise <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, he said, `` is swimming uphill and he ought to have Republicans, he ought to have the president in the boat with him.'' The year-old program, designed to prevent a serious illness from financially ruining retirees, is under attack from many older Americans. Some object because they already have catastrophic coverage and some higher-income retirees are upset because they must pay a large share of the program's cost. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to shift more of the cost to those with lower incomes, allow retirees to drop coverage if they also give up Medicare Part B -LRB- physicians' fees -RRB-, and to scale back reimbursement for prescriptions. There are indications the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> may vote instead to repeal the program. The latest proposal considered by the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> would cut the $ 800 maximum annual surtax paid by higher-income retirees to $ 400; slow scheduled increases in the $ 4-a-month flat fee for catastrophic coverage that most retirees pay; permit beneficiaries to drop catastrophic protection if they also give up Medicare Part B; require retirees to pay more of physicians' fees before the new protection kicks in; and eliminate coverage for most prescription drugs. Another element being considered by the panel would pay some costs of the program by requiring that all state and local government employees pay the share of Social Security taxes that finances <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>. Present law requires that state and local employees hired on or after April 1, 1986, pay the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> tax, which this year is 1.45 percent of the first $ 48,000 of annual earnings. About 3 million employees would face the tax increase under the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> proposal.

<HEAD>TV Fans Suffer Withdrawal Pangs After Marathon Soap Opera Runs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA SMILEY</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Just as American television viewers are beginning a new season of <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON> intrigues and <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Channing </PERSON> plots, their fans here are suffering the pain of soap opera withdrawal. It's a hard comedown for viewers who for the past few months have enjoyed an almost nonstop run of `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>,'' `` Dynasty,'' `` Knots Landing'' and `` Falcon Crest.'' Channel 55, <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>'s government-run English-language television network, presents the shows nightly instead of once a week, as in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. This means an entire season's 30 installments are shown in one month. <PERSON> Hamad </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Mutlak </PERSON>, director of foreign programming, said this has enabled the network to catch up with the series in the States, whereas they previously lagged as much as two seasons behind. `` Falcon Crest'' ended this month with <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Channing </PERSON>'s claim on the <LOCATION> Tuscany </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> vineyard again in doubt and her son <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> headed for jail. Because the shows must be sent off for subtitling in Arabic, it will be sometime next summer before local viewers find out what happens next. While dedicated fans may look in vain for acceptable substitutes, the end of the American soaps does not mean television in this desert region has become a wasteland. The TV fare in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, in fact, might be considered couch potato heaven, with perhaps more to choose from than in most countries, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Top documentaries and educational programs _ from <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public television's `` Smithsonian World'' to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s `` All the World's A Stage'' _ run in prime time, along with <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shakespearan </ORGANIZATION> dramas, `` Sixty Minutes,'' sitcoms, cop shows, wildlife programs, movies and mini-series from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. Foreign TV addicts might find the periodic `` prayer intermissions'' on gulf networks a bit disruptive, and they might be annoyed by the odd transitions that result from Moslem censors excising scenes of kissing and what one local TV producer called `` the passionate stuff between the sheets.'' On the other hand, there's hardly more than a hint of advertising. Ads on <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> TV run in two-minute commercial breaks once or twice an evening. Viewers here may also watch TV from <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> _ even from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, depending on their antennae and the region's freakish atmospheric conditions The other Arabic countries also have a wide range of programming for foreign as well as local viewers. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s Aramco station, which basically serves the oil company's foreign employees, brings top sports events from abroad. It is currently showing this year's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basketball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> finals. The Saudi channels offer news in Arabic, English and French, and last week gave their late night audiences the videotaped confessions, with English voiceover, of 16 Kuwaitis convicted of terrorist bombings in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> _ just hours after they were all beheaded. Americans make up a relatively small segment of the foreign audience. But since `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' was first shown here in 1975, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soaps, with their fast-paced plots and lively characters in luxurious settings, are the most popular programs, <PERSON> Mutlak </PERSON> said. By contrast, one local TV critic complained of being bored by the Australian soap `` Sons and Daughters'' because `` all the action seems to take place in somebody's kitchen.'' <PERSON> Mutlak </PERSON> said many viewers agreed, and it wo n't be renewed. When on the tube, the American soaps are even bad news for <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>'s video shops _ accounting for a 25 percent drop in rentals, according to <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>, manager of a local video distributor. He said that after watching `` Knots Landing'' or `` Falcon Crest'' from 9 to 10 p.m., `` people are too tired to watch a video.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON> took a hard line Tuesday at his first news conference, insisting that those arrested in the spring democracy movement were criminals and refusing to rule out more executions. Asked by a reporter if the `` Tiananmen tragedy'' could have been avoided, <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> said: `` We believe it was not a tragedy. `` Tiananmen was a counterrevolutionary rebellion opposing the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders and seeking to overthrow the socialist system,'' he said. Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, who also took part in the news conference, reaffirmed the party's determination to end rampant corruption and said new limits on official perks would be announced in a few days. The 62-year-old <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>, whose highest previous post was head of the <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> party committee, was catapulted into the national leadership in June after soldiers retook <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> by force from student-led pro-democracy protesters, killing hundreds and possibly thousands of people en route to the square. His predecessor, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, was accused of supporting the protests and ousted. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> took a mild tone toward <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> on Tuesday, saying he was leading a `` comfortable life'' and receiving full salary. He said <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> was still under investigation but did not suggest he might face further punishment or be put on trial. The unusual news conference, for both local and foreign reporters, appeared intended to demonstrate the solidity of the new party leadership in time for the 40th anniversary of the founding of Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on Oct. 1. When <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> took office in 1987, he was the first party leader to hold a news conference with foreign reporters in more than a decade. But while <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> shook hands and joked with the reporters, <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> sat behind a table in the Great Hall of the People and answered most questions with well-worn phrases from official speeches and editorials. He appeared relaxed, however, and ventured a few personal remarks, complimenting two young Taiwanese reporters on their Mandarin Chinese. Mandarin is the official language of both the mainland and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, but many older Chinese speak regional dialects. In an apparent effort to emphasize a collective leadership, <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> was joined by <PERSON> Li </PERSON> and the four other members of the <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the party's top body. Each answered at least one question. Song Ping, in charge of party organization, and <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> <PERSON> Yilin </PERSON>, in charge of economic planning, read their answers, indicating the questions they were asked were arranged in advance. The leaders' comments held no surprises, reiterating the party emphasis since June on opposing Western `` bourgeois'' influences and promoting traditional socialist values. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> said the party was understanding toward most students and others who took part in the massive pro-democracy marches of the spring and would seek to `` unify and educate them.'' `` The youth are the hope of the future,'' he said. `` We are full of warmth toward them ... But there is no denying that there have been some conspirators who acted with ulterior motives to overthrow the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the government. They have violated Chinese law.'' Asked if he could rule out that dissidents who advocated non-violence, such as student leader <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, would be executed, <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> said it was up to the courts to decide. `` We can not substitute the party for the government or for the judicial system,'' he said. At least 12 executions have been reported of people clearly accused of taking part in the pro-democracy protests in some form. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> confirmed that the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, its main policy-making body, soon will hold its first plenary meeting since June but said no date has been set. He said the committee will discuss economic problems. He did not say if the retirement of senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> will also be discussed. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, 85, stepped down from most of his official posts in 1987, and has suggested several times that he also resign as chairman of the state and party military commissions, <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> said. `` But much is at stake, so it still depends on the decision of the party and the state to decide the appropriate time at which Comrade <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> can retire and the person who might succeed him,'' <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> said. Several top officials, including <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON> and Defense Minister <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiwei </PERSON> are reportedly vying for <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s posts <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s actual power as key policy-maker far exceeds the scope of his military posts, however, and he is likely to continue as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s supreme leader even if he resigns from them. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> said some have pointed out that the last two party chiefs _ <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON> _ both lost their posts in disgrace for failing to take a stand against liberalism. But he declined to assess his chances for staying in office.

<HEAD>Rural County Calls on Capitol Muscle to Save Doomed Military Base</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Updates throughout with defeat of audit provision.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The rural roads of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> are a world away from the shiny floors of the Capitol, but folks who want to save a military base understand one thing about <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>: clout can carry a price. So they went after some, but lost a vote in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, anyway. Residents of <LOCATION> Champaign </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, population 150,000, hired an influential lobbying firm _ <PERSON> Patton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> and Blow _ to help them as senators considered a $ 288 billion defense bill. They hoped the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would retain a provision in the giant defense bill ordering an audit of the costs of closing the bases. But the provision was defeated today, 86-14. The version of the 1990 defense bill approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said no base could be closed unless an audit found that the costs of dismantling it would be recovered within six years. The county and the cities of <LOCATION> Champaign </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rantoul </LOCATION> chipped in $ 30,000, and readers responding to a full-page advertisement in the local newspaper also sent contributions. Businesses, aware of <ORGANIZATION> Chanute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>'s impact on the area's fragile economy, joined the effort, too. `` The role of our lobbyists is to do whatever they can _ that is fair and appropriate _ to turn this thing around,'' says <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON>, an attorney and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Urbana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. `` When you consider the unfairness of the decision and include with that the phenomenal impact on this whole area, the amount we're spending on lobbyists is a drop in a bucket,'' said <PERSON> Webber </PERSON>. `` We're not ever going to say die.'' The decision to hire a lobbyist has sparked something of a debate among lawmakers who represent the area. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill., said he doubted it would make much difference Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., seeking re-election, said the <LOCATION> Chanute </LOCATION> forces need all the help they can get, adding, `` I wish we lived in a pure society where no one would have to hire lobbyists There is no question a lobbyist can do some good.'' Some in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, however, wondered if it was too late. `` We are just concerned with the ability of paid lobbyists to turn a bad situation around in the bottom of the ninth inning,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Almy </PERSON>, spokesman for Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON>, R-Ill., whose district includes <LOCATION> Chanute </LOCATION> `` As paid advocates of our constituents we do n't want to see them getting less than their money's worth.'' <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON> favors saving the base. Lobbyist <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON>, son of Rep. <PERSON> Lindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., did not return phone calls requesting comment on the lobbying effort <LOCATION> Chanute </LOCATION> <LOCATION> AFB </LOCATION>, about 120 miles south of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, has about 8,500 military and civilian personnel and provides training in such fields as firefighting and aircraft and missile maintenance. Last December, when an independent commission said the government should close 86 bases and realign 59 others, <LOCATION> Chanute </LOCATION> was on the list, cited for a shortage of buildings and recreational facilities and inadequate housing. The conclusion by the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Base Closing and Realignment stunned many lawmakers, especially <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON>, who said the government had spent $ 150 million on new buildings there during the last seven years. <LOCATION> Chanute </LOCATION> defenders claim the commission made glaring errors. A university study said closing the base could devastate the area. `` Hiring those lobbyists does n't do anything more,'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said. `` Everything they talked to me about I've done.'' But <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> added: `` The firm is a good one. ... When you're fighting for your life, you do everything you can do If you live in the city of <LOCATION> Rantoul </LOCATION> and you have a business, this is a serious thing.''

 A judge in the city of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> dropped assassination and other charges against the two reputed leaders of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s international drug network because of lack of evidence, a <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> newspaper reported today. The military, meanwhile, imposed heavy security on the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> tourist city of <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION> today after another bomb blast blamed on drug traffickers killed two people and injured one at a Hilton hotel. The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION> said a <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> judge on Monday dropped charges against <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, alleged leaders of the Medellin-based drug operation that supplies most of the cocaine in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The two men are on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> list of 12 key drug figures wanted for prosecution in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The president of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Norberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, said last week that the two men contacted him and said they would be willing to move their drug operations out of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> in return for an end to the government's crackdown on trafficking. <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> had been charged with complicity in the kidnapping last year of <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastrana </PERSON>, who was a candidate for mayor of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pastrana </PERSON> was freed in an army raid and went on to be elected mayor of the capital. <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> also were charged with planning the assassination of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s attorney general, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyos </PERSON>, on Jan. 25 in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION> said Judge <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> cited lack of evidence in dropping the charges against the two men. None of the reputed leaders of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s drug operations has ever been prosecuted. The dropping of charges has no effect on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> extradition orders. Also today, a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister was to meet with representatives of the country's 4,600 judges in an effort to head off a strike protesting what the judges call inadequate government protection from drug gangs. Meanwhile, a guerrilla group that is about to sign a peace agreement with the government of President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> said drug traffickers should be pardoned, daily newspapers reported. The April 19 Movement, known as M-19, reportedly issued a communique at its base camp saying peace talks should be expanded to include the drug traffickers. The traffickers declared war on the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government after the government launched a crackdown following the assassination of a leading presidential candidate, <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, on Aug. 18. The guerrilla communique was signed by the rebel group's chiefs of staff, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Pizarro </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon-Gomez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, <PERSON> Otty </PERSON> <PERSON> Patino </PERSON> and German <PERSON> Rojas </PERSON> <PERSON> Nino </PERSON>, the newspapers <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiempo </PERSON> said. The signing of a peace agreement by the guerrillas and the government has been postponed each of the last two days due to last-minute changes in the agreement. Pardoning the traffickers is not one of the guerillas' demands, the newspapers said. The news conference was held at the guerrilla base camp in the tiny village of <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Domingo </LOCATION> in the Andes mountains in southwest <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. The April 19 Movement takes its name after the date of a 1970 presidential election that dissidents said was fraudulent. The group seized <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> in 1985. Ninety-five people were killed, most in an army assault that ended the takeover. There are six guerrilla groups in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> with an estimated 10,000 combatants. The government is not negotiating with any other guerrilla group. Colombian marines, army troops and national police patrolled <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION> today, searching cars at roadblocks and frisking pedestrians, said Col. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>, chief of the national police in <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION>. The dead at the hotel were Colombian doctors attending a medical convention, <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> said. He said no one claimed responsibility for the blast. The hotel bomb and another that exploded at a <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION> bank Monday were the first bombings in that city since the drug war began. One person was injured by the bomb Monday night at the bank, <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> said. A third bomb exploded Monday night in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> at a government electric company's billing office, the national police said. No injuries were reported. Many of the bombings since mid-August have been against government-owned banks and utilities. The majority owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Cartagena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> is the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The Hilton's 1,500 guests were evacuated to other <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION> hotels, Col. <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> said. Thousands of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, Canadian and other foreign tourists visit <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION> and its beaches each year. The city also is a regular stop for <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> cruise ships.

<HEAD>Parliament Adopts Liberal Laws</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Parliament on Tuesday adopted liberal laws that guarantee the rights of Hungarians to travel abroad and even to emigrate. The session that opened Tuesday is to decide a series of key bills designed to pave the way for next year's elections, the first in more than 40 years that will be freely contested by more than one party. The volume of legislation led deputies to vote for extending the session past Friday, when it had been set to end. The house also was to review changes in the penal code this week but postponed until Oct. 17 discussion of other key bills, including a law on the functioning of political parties, an electoral law and constitutional changes that will remove references to the leading role of the Communist Party. The Communists have committed themselves to multiparty elections and have pledged to go into opposition if they lose. More than 70 percent of the 387 parliament deputies are <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members. In the past, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> met four times a year for less than a week, essentially rubber-stamping the Communist government's policies In recent months, however, independents and some reform-minded <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> have sparked considerable debate and even forced revisions on some key legislation. The new laws adopted Tuesday lift most restrictions on travel, meaning that Hungarians no longer need to seek permission from authorities for foreign travel or emigration, and that Hungarians who emigrated _ even those who were forced to because of their political views _ may return at any time. The laws take effect Jan. 1. Interior Minister <PERSON> Istvan </PERSON> <PERSON> Horvath </PERSON> told a news confernce after the bills were adopted that `` Freedom of movement is no longer dependent on the arbitrariness of the authorities.'' He said the new bills were in line with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s emerging liberal policies were demonstrated by the government's decision to remove the barbed wire and other obstacles along its western border with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, and to allow thousands of East Germans seeking to emigrate to the West to cross legally into <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. The decision this month to let the East Germans go has deeply angered <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s hard-line East bloc allies. Also Tuesday, four opposition members became the first freely elected non-Communists to take their seats in the house since the Communists consolidated power in 1948. They won a majority vote in recent freely contested by-elections. `` Never in the past 42 years was being an MP such an honor,'' said <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> <PERSON> Roszik </PERSON>, one of the oposition members. `` We can all be proud regardless of how we got here, to be able to participate in this transition,'' he said. <PERSON> Roszik </PERSON>, who was accompanied to the session by a group of supporters waving <LOCATION> Hungarian </LOCATION> flags, said the participation of the four opposition members marked `` one of the most significant steps of the revolution under way in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, as we move from dictatorial socialism to democracy.'' The fall session of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> was marked by another first. An electronic voting system was installed to ensure an accurate count. In the past, voting was conducted by a show of hands, often leading to discrepancies and calls for recounts.

<TEXT>
 Vandals damaged the remains of a 13th-century Carmelite monastery in northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, apparently to protest a controversial Carmelite convent near the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> death camp in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, an official said Tuesday. <PERSON> Shalom </PERSON> <PERSON> Yankelevitch </PERSON>, commissioner of antiquities for the city of <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>, said the vandalism followed reports that Jewish religious extremists had threatened Carmelite nuns carrying out an archaeological dig at the monastery. The vandalism was discovered last week. Sister <PERSON> Damien </PERSON>, a Carmelite nun from <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> who is leading the dig, told <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television her order has always opposed having nuns pray at the Roman Catholic convent on the edge of <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>. `` So for people to hurt our ruins here to try to make the sisters come out, they are hurting the people who are trying to get -LRB- the nuns -RRB- out,'' she said. Jewish leaders say the convent, with its 12-foot-high cross, is offensive because of the presence of Christian symbols at a place where 2.5 million Jews were killed by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> in World War II. <PERSON> Yankelevitch </PERSON> said the damage to the convent near <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION> came after an article appeared in a local newspaper saying anonymous religious groups demanded the nuns delay their dig until the convent at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> is moved. The vandals caused extensive damage, <PERSON> Yankelevitch </PERSON> said. `` They toppled the entrance arch into the ... cathedral, and the arch leading to the 2nd floor of a sideyard, and stone steps. All this from the 13th century was damaged and broken,'' he said. A group of American archaelogists has been excavating for two years at the one-acre site on biblical <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION>. The dig has uncovered new parts of the well-preserved Carmelite cathedral and a fortress and ancient water system that are part of an entire monastery complex. The Carmelite nuns are trying to prove that the site dates back to the 5th century, which would predate by 100 years any other <ORGANIZATION> Christain </ORGANIZATION> order on <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION> is the spiritual center of Carmelites throughout the world, and Carmelites here have written letters to Israeli newspapers calling for moving the convent from <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>. Some have traveled to <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> to press for transferring the nuns. <PERSON> Yankelevitch </PERSON> said he believed there was a connection between the vandalism and threats by religious groups, but he did not rule out other possibilities. The investigation is in police hands, he said. The damage was reported as the controversy over the convent in <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> seemed to be easing. Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> said last week that he believed the nuns should be moved to an interfaith prayer center to be built in accordance with a 1987 agreement between Jewish and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> officials. The statement overcame opposition by Polish primate <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> and Polish Catholics, who have argued the nuns should be allowed to remain because they cause no harm and because many Christians also were killed at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday canceled an invitation to <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>, citing what it called his `` harrowing'' anti-Jewish statements. The <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nijmegen </LOCATION>, in the eastern <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, said: `` The -LRB- university -RRB- board is aware of Cardinal <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>'s statement's on the Jews and the Jewish people ... and distances itself emphatically from those statements. In an Aug. 26 sermon, <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> accused Jews of provoking anti-Semitism in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and of speaking to the Poles as `` a nation elevated over all others.''

 When <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ring </PERSON> showed up at his corner grocery, singing `` I'm Just Wild About Harry'' in praise of his favorite cat, it marked his chief contact with the world for the day. His brother, <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>, was never seen at all. It was only when their equally reclusive sister, <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>, died last week that the brothers were delivered from a life in a filthy home without running water or electricity. But now they face an uncertain future. Said <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, a neighbor since the Rings moved to the working-class <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> neighborhood in the 1950s: `` I could n't believe it Who could get by today without electricity and gas and water? ... I would have helped them, but they were n't people who wanted you to get involved.'' <PERSON> Gerri </PERSON> <PERSON> Abban </PERSON>, the cashier at nearby <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>'s Market, says the plight of the Rings was obvious but the best way to help them was not. The market's owner since 1956, <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, gave <PERSON> John </PERSON> discounts and looked the other way when one of his checks bounced. But the Rings would not let anyone in the house, and social workers and priests responded to Ms. <PERSON> Abban </PERSON>'s pleas for help by noting that the family had a right to privacy. `` I sold them charcoal in the winter so they could heat the house,'' Ms. <PERSON> Abban </PERSON> said. `` I sold them rubbing alcohol, five bottles at a time, so they could cook. I sold them bottle after bottle of Anacin because they'd get wicked headaches from the smell in the house. Paper plates, paper cups, bottled water. It was unbelievable.'' The isolation ended last week when <PERSON> John </PERSON>, 59, called police to report that his 58-year-old sister's pulse was weak. Police said they arrived to find her dead, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> and 62-year-old <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> in poor mental condition. The brothers refused to leave the house, though it reeked of waste from the Rings and their two dozen cats. They were sent to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> for evaluation, and a hospital spokeswoman would say only that they were in stable condition. In an interview published Tuesday, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ring </PERSON> said neither he, his brother nor his sister had worked since the 1950s or early'60s, choosing instead to live with their parents, who died more than a decade ago. `` The cats took all our money ... cost us $ 60 a week worth of cat food. That's why we could n't fix the place up,'' Ring said. `` But we're going to now.'' Asked why he did n't accept help, <PERSON> Ring </PERSON> said: `` I did n't want to bother anybody. But pretty soon <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> and I will be well again and we'll go back and fix the house up. I'm sure that everything will be fine as soon as we get out of the hospital.'' City officials say however that the house is in such bad shape it has been condemned. And the <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> came for the cats. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, proprietor of <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>'s since 1956, said the Rings did n't have much, but they received some sort of veterans assistance and were n't penniless They paid with personal checks that occasionally bounced, and <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> gave them unofficial discounts. `` I'm not saying how many -LRB- checks bounced -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. `` Let's just say I've got a few in my file.'' `` If <PERSON> John </PERSON> did n't take his medication, he went wild,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. `` When he'd come down to the store to buy, he'd stuff his pockets, he'd throw things around and yell at people. We understood him. We did the best we could. We got him home.'' Neighbors said <PERSON> John </PERSON> and his sister went to church each Sunday. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> recalled <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> as `` a very fine lady, always well-spoken. She seemed to be well-read and her whole life was taking care of her two brothers. It's a mystery to me why, but she did it.'' As for the other brother, `` I do n't know anything about <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. `` I saw the man once in a flashing instant when I went to the house.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ring </PERSON> said his brother had been wounded in World War II. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> gave up trying to understand why the Rings lived the way they did. `` You had a good daddy. I had a good daddy,'' he said. `` We ca n't all be lucky.'' `` Everybody has a right to their privacy. It was my business and it was n't my business. I sent a plumber up there, I sent an electrician, and they could n't get in.'' <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, a retired union leader, said that he thought <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> had died back in the early 1970s. Then some years ago, a fire broke out on the street, and he saw a man with a beard down to his belt and a blanket around him. `` I said, ` Who is that?' And someone said, ` That's <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>.' I never believed there was -LRB- a third person -RRB- in there.''

 Three couples have been declared winners in the first annual Great American Kiss-Off, but their lips are sealed about what they'll take home for their efforts. The six contestants agreed to divvy up the $ 10,000 top prize after smooching for 42 days then hiring a lawyer to legally unlock their lips. `` I'm just glad it's over,'' <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> said Tuesday, one day after all parties embraced the pact. He and his wife, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON>, were declared the official first-place finishers after they and two other couples outlasted 11 other pairs who entered the contest sponsored by a furniture company. The company agreed to let the three top couples split the $ 10,000 as they pleased and without revealing how. `` We thought it was going to be a two-week thing, but it turned into a marathon,'' said <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON>. `` I'm recovered now. But it still feels like I'm kissing. ... It's like when you've been wearing a hat for four or five weeks and then take it off. The hat still feels like it's on.'' But <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON>, 39, said he still kissed his 36-year-old wife and mother of their five children good night. `` I'm not tired of kissing her,'' he said. `` I think everyone decided we should be the winners because they realized we could go on the longest.'' <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON>, who is unemployed, said he survived financially because he owned a tile fitting business in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> before moving to <LOCATION> Fernley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, in 1985. <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Cashill </PERSON> said he was hired by parents of the other two couples in their late teens and early 20s to help end the contest so their children could get on with their lives. `` These people were really caught up in a horrible situation,'' <PERSON> Cashill </PERSON> said. `` It was like they were in bondage. They would n't quit; $ 10,000 is a lot of money. Under the agreement, the <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> couple got the deed to an <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> time-share condominium, which was the first-place prize along with the money. The declared second-place finishers and winners of an expenses-paid trip to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> were <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> and <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Gubler </PERSON> of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bret </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Block </PERSON> of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> claimed the third-place prize of new living room furniture. The pact to end the Kiss-Off began developing Friday and the contest was suspended pending the outcome of negotiations. <PERSON> Butch </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>, a publicist for the Kiss-Off, said the furniture company was a bit disappointed in the outcome of the contest. `` It was fairly anticlimactic,'' <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> said. `` We were hoping there would be a big winner and a ceremony with champagne to hand out the $ 10,000 check.'' <PERSON> Gubler </PERSON> expects to go back to his father's auto body shop, while <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> will resume his career as a financial planner and Ms. <PERSON> Block </PERSON> will look for a new job, having lost hers at a bank, <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> said. Contest organizers thought the competition would last only about two weeks, but relatively easy rules allowed the contest to continue. Couples had to kiss for 12 hours each day, from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., in the furniture store's parking lot, with five-minute breaks each hour. On Aug. 26, three competing couples, including the Gublers, married in a triple wedding ceremony.

<HEAD>Third World Military Spending Needs Scrutiny, Says Conable</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Urging closer scrutiny of Third World defense budgets, <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> said Tuesday poor countries spent more on the military than on health and education combined at times during the past decade. `` But let us hope that in the changing political climate of the 1990s, resources are increasingly allocated to more productive purposes,'' he said in an address prepared for the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting. As a whole, low income countries currently spend around 20 percent of their funds on defense, <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> said. Despite cuts in other necessities, `` the $ 200 billion which the developing world spends annually on the military has largely been protected,'' he said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> spent about $ 290 billion on the military in fiscal year 1989, or about 29 percent of the national budget. <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> said it's time for `` developing countries on one side, and their arms suppliers on the other,'' to `` adapt to a world where budgets are tight. `` It is important to place military spending on the same footing as other fiscal decisions, to examine possible trade-offs more systematically, and to explore ways to bring military spending into better balance with development priorities,'' he said. Every country has the right and duty to defend itself, and `` in evaluating military expenditures governments should be realistic, but they also should remember the human consequences of these choices,'' said <PERSON> Conable </PERSON>, who as a former <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Congressman had some experience with guns-vs. - Military spending is `` a sensitive component of the fiscal problem'' that can no longer be neglected, <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> said, because arms are often a prime source of external debt, accounting for a third or more of the interest due by some major Third World debt-ridden countries.

<HEAD>World's Written Heritage Turning to Dust With Alarming Speed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By F.N. D'ALESSIO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The world's written heritage is turning to dust with alarming speed and newer books are among the first to crumble, said specialists gathered Tuesday to discuss book preservation. `` Sixteen million volumes and manuscripts in the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will require treatment to prevent total deterioration,'' said preservationist <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. `` Two-and-a-half million books in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Public </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Library </LOCATION> -LRB- system -RRB- turn to dust every year.'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and other preservationists are members of a library task for the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION>, an organization of Midwestern universities and libraries. The task force began meeting Monday to consider various preservation techniques. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, book preservation director for <ORGANIZATION> Akzo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemicals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, wants to seal books in a gas chamber, while <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Wei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> o </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Matteson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, wants to douse them with solvents. Other possibilities are water-based baths and aerosol sprays. Until one system is proved best, laboratory director <PERSON> Mimi </PERSON> <PERSON> Lampert </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Newberry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> will continue to preserve the private institution's rarest books page-by-page, and to lock the rest in darkness _ in a 10-level, windowless, climate-controlled tower. `` In essence, we keep our books in a huge thermos bottle,'' she said. Few public institutions, however, could afford to adopt the <PERSON> Newberry </PERSON>'s measures, which even include white-gloved page-turners who are the only people allowed to touch certain books. Studies in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> proved that atmospheric pollutants have a role in the deterioration of books, but Ms. <PERSON> Lampert </PERSON> said the main culprit is the acid content of the paper itself. The deterioration first sets in as yellowing and soon progresses to brittleness. Finally, the paper simply crumbles. Ironically, the destructive process works faster in newer books, preservationists said. Books printed before 1850 are relatively immune because the linen rag paper used in earlier centuries was acid-free. Modern mass publishing involves cheaper wood-pulp paper, which contains acid. Neutralizing acid is the key to preservation, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s company, using a process developed at the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, seals books in a vacuum chamber, where they are permeated with vapors of diethyl zinc. Zinc oxide then binds with the paper, neutralizing the acid. `` It also makes the paper fluoresce bright orange under ultraviolet light, so it can also be used as an identification and anti-theft device for rare books,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. The process was first demonstrated in a kitchen pressure cooker, but is now done in chambers developed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s process, developed with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION>, soaks books in a solution of magnesium carbonate, liquified Freon and wood alcohol. His company also produces an aerosol spray for use by private book collectors. `` None of the systems are going to save paper that is already brittle,'' Ms. <PERSON> Lampert </PERSON> said.

<UNK>Father's Will Says Zola Budd Unwelcome at His Funeral</UNK>

<TEXT>
 The slain father of track star <PERSON> Zola </PERSON> <PERSON> Budd </PERSON> said in his will that his three daughters were not welcome at his funeral, which was scheduled for Wednesday, the independent <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Budd </PERSON>, who had been estranged from his family for several years, was fatally shot Thursday at a farmhouse outside the central city of <LOCATION> Bloemfontein </LOCATION> where he lived alone. A man doing construction work on the farm is being held in connection with the killing. <PERSON> Budd </PERSON>'s fomer wife, <PERSON> Tossie </PERSON>, and their son, Quintus, were expected to be at the funeral, but it was not known if Ms. <PERSON> Budd </PERSON> and her sisters would attend, according to the news agency. <PERSON> Budd </PERSON>, 59, did not attend Ms. <PERSON> Budd </PERSON>'s April 15 wedding in <LOCATION> Bloemfontein </LOCATION>, saying he was not invited. Ms. <PERSON> Budd </PERSON> left <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in 1984 and was hurriedly granted a British passport so she could compete in the Summer Olympics in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is barred from the Olympics and most international competition because of its apartheid policies of racial segregation. In the 3,000-meter run, the barefoot Ms. <PERSON> Budd </PERSON> collided with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> star <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> <PERSON> Slaney </PERSON>, and the American was unable to continue. <PERSON> Budd </PERSON> finished seventh amid a chorus of boos. She later set several world distance running records while living and training in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. But she was constantly dogged by anti-apartheid activists who said she should not be allowed to compete due to her South African connections. Ms. <PERSON> Budd </PERSON>, 23, returned to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in May 1988 suffering from what doctors said was `` complete mental exhaustion.'' She says she plans to forego international competition and live in her homeland indefinitely.

<HEAD>Small Lines Vital to Rural America, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Miles of track cast off by the big railroad companies and now operated by smaller lines are vital to rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report said Tuesday. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON>, administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, said the number and mileage of small railroads began to increase in the 1970s but gained a full head of steam in the mid-1980s. As for the future, he said that `` growth in the local and regional railroad movement probably will be determined by the outcome of court rulings as to the rights of rail labor in branch line sales and in transactions that create new railroads.'' Since the Staggers Act of 1980, which eased the way for big rail companies to sell off unprofitable branch lines, nearly 200 small railroads have been formed, the report said. A fifth of these are owned by shippers. `` Local and regional railroads now operate over approximately 15 percent of the nation's rail system, or 30,000 miles, and employ 30,000 people,'' the report said. `` Last year, these carriers generated $ 1.5 billion in revenues.'' Small railroads are freight lines that earn less than $ 20 million annually and operate less than 350 miles of track. The report said that as much as 25,000 additional miles of rail line are expected to be cast off by large railroads before they are finished with restructuring plans. Eighteen thousand miles are to be sold to small railroads over the next two years. `` These carriers will function primarily as feeder lines originating in rural agricultural regions and funneling traffic into the national rail network,'' the report said.

 Television coverage, radio equipment and newspaper cameras were barred from former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s confrontation with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday _ a ban forced by his lawyer against what he charged was the panel's `` circus-like atmosphere.'' `` We pulled the plug from their main act because, in fact, we thought it would create a more somber forum,'' attorney <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perito </PERSON> said. `` The circus-like atmosphere has been created by them, not by us,'' <PERSON> Perito </PERSON> said before television cameras assembled outside the congressional hearing where <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> appeared under subpoena. With the cameras gone, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> invoked his constitutional right against self-incrimination and refused to answer the subcommittee's questions <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s lawyer invoked a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rule that dates to the <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> hearings of the 1950s. It allows witnesses subpoenaed to appear before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to bar broadcast coverage and still photographs of their appearance. Four television networks _ <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> _ failed in their attempt to win a temporary injunction from a federal judge in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Monday to prevent <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> from invoking the rule. Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Government Operations subcommittee on employment and housing, which is probing <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s tenure as secretary of housing and urban development, said he favored repealing the rule and was reluctantly enforcing it <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> permitted full coverage of the subcommittee by radio, television and photographers for an hour and 15 minutes while he and other members discussed their investigation and <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s likely refusal to testify. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> did not enter the committee room, however, until after <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> called a brief recess and ordered television, radio and still photographic coverage to cease. Three television cameras remained in the room, apparently shut off with their lenses pointing away from <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> then appealed to <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> a final time to reconsider the ban on coverage. `` On advice of my counsel, I ask that the rule be employed,'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said. Reporters remained in the room, however, and artists for the television networks sketched the scene. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> permitted reporters to use tape recorders to record <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s words. The subcommittee staff asked reporters who recorded the event to sign a brief statement saying the audio recording `` will not be broadcast in any manner.'' The document said reporters agreed `` under the penalty of perjury.'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> read a brief statement saying he would not answer questions, then invoked his constitutional right each time as <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> posed eight questions. After <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> left, camras and microphones were allowed to record subcommittee members' criticism of the former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> secretary. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> is under subpoena to appear again Oct. 27. <PERSON> Perito </PERSON> said he would decide then whether he will seek to ban coverage again.

 Newlyweds frightened by Hurricane Hugo into canceling honeymoon plans in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> found a romantic getaway in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, until they had to ride out the fierce storm in a motel bathtub. `` I'll never forget it for the rest of my life.

The <ORGANIZATION> Kimballs </ORGANIZATION> had planned a <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> vacation, but warned by reports of <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s destructive power, they canceled those plans. Then they were offered the chance to use Mrs. <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON>'s mother-in-law's beachfront condominium `` It seemed like the sensible thing to do,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON> said. The condominium was on the Isle of Palms off <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> _ the bulls-eye of <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s first strike on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mainland. `` We got there -LRB- and -RRB- we were thrilled. The condo was right on the beach. It was beautiful,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON> said. `` The first night we were out there running around on the beach all night. The next day we went shopping in town and spent oodles of money. The next morning, at 6 o'clock, they were evacuating the whole island.'' Chased from the resort island, the couple took a motel room in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> Thursday night. `` We were still trying to hang in there,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kimbsion </PERSON> `` cooked the books.'' Behind the scenes, the lobbying firm of <LOCATION> Patton </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> and <PERSON> Blow </PERSON> urged members to vote against the <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> amendment. Picking up the lobbyists tab of about $ 30,000 were residents and businesses near <LOCATION> Chanute </LOCATION> Air Force Base, Ill.

<HEAD>Indian Urban Life Depicted in New Center</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLLINSVILLE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The way of life in a city that prospered centuries before <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> is depicted in a new exhibit that should correct the view of those whose only knowledge of Indians comes from television Westerns, an organizer says. The Mississippian Indians who lived on what is now the <LOCATION> Cahokia </LOCATION> Mounds State Historic Site between 900 and 1200 A.D. made a unique attempt at urbanization, experts say. The site, with its distinctive earthen mounds built for Indian ceremonies, is the largest archaelogical site in the country. The $ 8.2 million visitors center that opened here last weekend features a video program, reconstructed buildings and other displays intended to show what life was like in the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>' city, which is believed to have had a population of 20,000. `` We're giving people an appreciation and insight into prehistoric Indian culture,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Iseminger </PERSON>, a staff member at the new visitors center. `` We're trying to educate people about Indian culture before the time of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>.'' The Indians had a political and religious culture and a well-defined social order of civil leaders, priests and nobles and a working class, experts say. Visitors to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interpretive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> will get an introduction to this culture with a widescreen video presentation on the Indians' life, centered around thatched-roof huts and the ceremonial mounds. `` Everybody thinks that Indians lived in tepees and rode horses. And of course, these Indians did n't have those things,'' <PERSON> Iseminger </PERSON> said. `` It's not the typical idyllic setting people usually associate with Native Americans, because it had reached the urban stage,'' he said, adding that this included some of the same problems plaguing modern-day city dwellers, such as pollution and overcrowding. The exhibits will change about every three months. An outdoor courtyard will be the site for classes and demonstrations of Indian crafts and skills. The reconstituted village features several kinds of structures, including a ceremonial sweat lodge and a grainery used for storage. Huts have thatched roofs made of native prairie grass. `` We may even build a small mound,'' Iseminger said. <PERSON> Iseminger </PERSON> said the center should be an excellent educational tool. `` We expect increased awareness and more people gaining knowledge about Indian life in the prehistoric period,'' he said.

<HEAD>Traces of Plastic Explosive Reported Found in French Airliner Wreckage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Experts probing the explosion that destroyed a French DC-10 over <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION> and killed all 171 people aboard believe they have found traces of the powerful explosive Semtex in the wreckage, two French dailies said Tuesday. The newspapers Liberation and <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Parisien </PERSON> said the find strengthened the connection between the UTA airline crash and the Dec. 21, 1988, bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. The UTA flight originated in <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>, and blew up over a desert less than an hour after it took off for <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on Sept. 19 following a stopover in <LOCATION> N'Djamena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>. Both newspaper accounts cited unidentified sources involved in the investigation and said laboratory tests in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> still had to confirm the presence of Semtex, a malleable, hard-to-detect explosive made in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Liberation said the charge may have been concealed in a shipment of farm chemicals loaded aboard the DC-10 in <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION>. French investigators said earlier it appears certain an `` explosive substance'' in a front cargo compartment caused the crash, but gave few details. It is believed that a radio-cassette player containing Semtex was smuggled onto the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight that exploded over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, killing 270 people _ all 259 aboard the plane and 11 on the ground. The major suspect in that bombing was the Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. The group's leader, <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>, denied involvement Anonymous callers in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> claimed responsibility for the <ORGANIZATION> UTA </ORGANIZATION> crash on behalf of the Moslem extremist group <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jihad </ORGANIZATION> and a previously unknown Chadian organization. Those claims were not authenticated and French police appeared to be treating them with skepticism.

 Most students ended a two-week boycott of <ORGANIZATION> Motley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday after school officials and a black parents group settled a dispute over naming the school for civil rights leader <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lowndes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Lowndes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> agreed Monday to accept a compromise reached during an eight-hour negotiation Sunday with members of the county school board. The compromise came after two days of meetings that mediator <PERSON> Wil </PERSON> <PERSON> Colom </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> attorney, said showed `` real leadership in solving an emotional dispute.'' Under the compromise, the school will be known officially as West Lowndes Elementary, but the building itself will be named after King. `` This retains the board's position on naming a school after the area in which it is located,'' the compromise said. `` Other buildings at any school site can also be named for individuals who are deceased and whose names will not inflame the community,'' it added. The old school name of <PERSON> Motley </PERSON> reflected the name of the local unincorporated community, but blacks protested that the community was named for the family that owned a plantation in the area in slave-holding times. Tuesday's attendance at the elementary school was 350 out of 425 pupils expected, officials said. Only 32 students attended Sept. 12, the first day of school, because of dissatisfaction over the school's name and its incomplete construction. There were 212 students at the school Monday, officials reported. The compromise also says that when the board selects a new assistant superintendent of education, primary consideration will be given to a candidate's ability to communicate with and work with minority students, parents and staff. The <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lowndes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> had wanted a black assistant superintendent. The deal still needs federal court approval under a 1970 court desegregation order. School board approval came in a 45-minute closed session Monday. Board President <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Chism </PERSON> would n't give the vote tally or answer any questions.

<HEAD>Health Secretary Calls For Renewed Commitment to Improving Blacks'
Health</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Health Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said Tuesday the country must `` renew our commitment'' to improving the health of black Americans, who are dying younger than white Americans. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> cited a new government report showing life expectancy for blacks is several years shorter than for whites and that blacks have higher death rates than whites for infant mortality and for several diseases, including AIDS. `` Even as the lines on almost every disease chart move toward improvement, there is a continuing disparity in the burden of death and illness experienced by blacks and other minority Americans as compared with the improving health of Americans as a whole,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. `` We must renew our commitment to close these health disparities,'' he said. The report of mortality statistics for 1987 by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> shows that life expectancy at birth rose slightly from 1986 to reach a record high of 75 years in 1987. Life expectancy for white Americans was 75.6 years, but for blacks it was 69.4 years, the same as the previous year, according to the report. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome was the 10th leading cause of death for blacks, while it ranked 15th for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population overall in 1987. Of the more than 13,000 AIDS deaths, 65 percent were white males, 25 percent were black males and the remaining 10 percent were split evenly between white females and black females. Blacks also died at disproportionately higher rates from other illnesses, including kidney disease, for which the black death rate was 2.8 times the rate of the white population, and diabetes, for which the black death rate was 2.3 times that for whites, according to the report. The rate of infant mortality declined slightly in 1987 to 10.1 infant deaths per 1,000 live births, from 10.4 the previous year. The rate for whites dropped from 8.9 to 8.6, while the rate for blacks declined from 18 to 17.9. The report also shows the drug-related death rate for blacks was more than twice the rate for whites, and the homicide death rate for blacks was six times that of whites.

<HEAD>Study Finds Payoffs for Women Who Return to School</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Women who return to college and earn degrees report increased self-esteem and more satisfying jobs, according to a national study released Tuesday. The survey of nearly 3,400 selected graduates from 33 women's colleges also found that 56 percent continued their formal education beyond an undergraduate degree The study, conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, a project of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colleges </ORGANIZATION>, found that the typical graduate among those studied returned to school in her mid-30s and was married with school-age children. Of those who were married, 55 percent had been aged 18 to 21, the traditional college years, when they wed. The survey, conducted last year, included women who entered college after age 23 and graduated in the years 1970 to 1988. Eighty-eight percent of the women reported that their jobs changed in positive ways after they graduated; 87 percent said their education had contributed to an appreciation of their abilities. `` Achieving that degree had a major impact on their self-confidence, their sense of self-esteem and personal fulfillment and their sense of being an independent person,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> of the College of Notre Dame of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, the principal researcher on the study. Fifty-seven percent of the respondents said their main reason for returning to school was for personal fulfillment; 33 percent cited career reasons. Some 50 percent of the graduates were aged 31 to 44; the oldest was 85. The women typically were first-generation college graduates, had previously earned less than one year of college credit and completed their degrees in four years.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Tuesday he hopes his two-day education summit with the nation's governors this week will produce ways to `` dramatically change things'' in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s troubled schools `` We've got to see what it is we're doing wrong, how can we be more accountable,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters after hearing business leaders complain about the problems that poorly educated students cause in the workplace. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will travel by helicopter to <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, on Wednesday afternoon for an education summit with the governors on the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> campus. It will be only the third such presidential convocation of governors in history, and the first since President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> summoned governors more than half a century ago for their advice on coping with the Great Depression. Even before the governors gathered at <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>'s `` academical village,'' educators and politicians were expressing hope that the summit would give new impetus to a school reform movement that has shown signs of floundering White House officials and leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> have said the meeting's top priority will be to lay the groundwork for the first set of national performance goals for the schools <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who promised in last year's election campaign to become `` the education president,'' said, `` I think we're going to come together with the governors on major objectives for this country in terms of education, something that's never been done before.'' He said he has his ideas for changes but was keeping them private. `` I'm going down there to listen and work with the governors, not try to impose an agenda from here,'' he said. `` I want to see us come up with some suggestions that will dramatically change things,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I was just reminded by a group of business leaders that, on a per capita basis, we spent far more than <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, far more than <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and yet we're not achieving the way they are. `` We've got to see what it is we're doing wrong, how can we be more accountable,'' he said. `` It's in those areas of goals, national goals, but coming up through the governors, that I think we can make a real contribution.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akers </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> who led a <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roundtable </ORGANIZATION> delegation of corporate executives who met with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, scoffed at the notion that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s $ 353 billion education system suffers from a lack of money. `` There's twice as much money per student than is available in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the Japanese are beating our brains out,'' <PERSON> Akers </PERSON> said. `` It's not a money problem,'' he said. `` It's a management and an execution problem.'' The Business Roundtable executives, including the chairmen of <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION>, K Mart, <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Alcoa </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>, pledged that they and other leaders of the 200 major companies would get personally involved with school improvement efforts in their home states. `` We're not getting -LRB- enough -RRB- educated people to fill the jobs ... of importance to American industry,'' <PERSON> Akers </PERSON> said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kearns </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> chairman, said, `` We do n't yet have any momentum in the country for real, structural change'' in the schools. He said the summit could `` draw the governors and the administration into a coalition to really drive this.'' <PERSON> Kearns </PERSON> said that among needed changes are increased authority for teachers and principals to `` run the schools the way they need to, not the educational bureaucracy.'' Also, he said, `` we need Head Start for everybody.'' The $ 1.1 billion preschool development program for poor children now reaches fewer than 20 percent of those eligible. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supports Head Start, he has sought to dampen educators' hopes that any major new commitment of federal funds will flow from the education summit. `` We would not expect to come out with any new funding proposals,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will open the summit Wednesday with a welcome address to the governors, then begin the first three of six closed working sessions. The topics will include revitalizing the teaching profession, improving the learning environment _ including keeping drugs out of schools _ and governance, or determining who is in charge of the schools. After a state dinner Wednesday night in a tent outside <LOCATION> Monticello </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>'s home near the university, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the governors will reassemble Thursday morning for the final three working sessions on choice and restructuring, a competitive work force and postsecondary education. Those sessions _ attended by subgroups of the governors and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Cabinet _ will be followed by a plenary session, a luncheon convocation and a finale at which Republican and Democratic governors will join <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in delivering closing statements. After his return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will speak about the summit at a White House ceremony honoring outstanding secondary schools. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s Democratic governor, <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON>, sent word he will miss the summit. A leading advocate of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal to give parents more choice over which schools their children attend, <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> sent word he is staying at home to work for passage of a tax bill at a special session of the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> convened the first governors' summit in 1908 to discuss the urgency of preserving the country's natural resources. A governors' conference held in 1933 by his distant cousin, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, was overshadowed by the president's decision to close the banks on the morning of the summit

 Soviet and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> representatives on Tuesday approved an agreement for a mutual exchange of chambers of commerce, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported.

 Youngsters who enjoy reading are viewed by their peers as more likely to do well in school rather than as nerdy bookworms, a survey of children showed Wednesday. In addition, half the children surveyed, ages 6 to 10, said they `` really like to read'' and 42 percent `` sort of'' like to read, said the study conducted for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Only 7.2 percent said they did not like to read. The survey was conducted among 500 children at 10 suburban malls around the country in an approach that does not produce a representative sample, a news release said. According to the study, 62.4 percent of the children said a kid who reads a lot `` learns things in school more quickly,'' while 18.8 percent said such kids were called `` nerds or geeks.'' In fact, 18 percent said children who did not enjoy reading were likely to be called such names. Reading came in fifth of 12 activities when children were asked their favorite things to do, finishing behind playing with friends, outdoor sports, bicycling and watching television. Among the activities reading beat out in the popularity contest: video games and listening to music. The study also indicated that of reading, writing and arithmetic, math was the favorite subject of 48.2 percent, with reading pulling in 35.4 percent and writing 16 percent.

 <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON>, the black man who cracked the color barrier at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> 27 years ago, has been hired to what some see as an unlikely post: adviser to conservative Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>. <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON> said in an interview Tuesday that he had been hired officially on Sept. 5 to advise the senator on questions of race, education, drugs and urban problems, after providing informal advice for the last year. <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON>, 58, has changed his views markedly since becoming the first black enrolled at Ole Miss in 1962. Since then, he has called integration the `` biggest con job ever pulled on anybody.'' `` My understanding of the senator's position ... is that every citizen has the entitlement to every right,'' he said Tuesday. `` So there's no need for any specific rights. And I agree with that. `` It is the specific intent of the liberal elite to establish on a permanent basis a dual citizenship in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. They need to keep blacks in a non full-citizenship status. It's not Senator <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> who does n't want blacks to be free in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. It's the liberal agenda. In a letter to acquaintances, he wrote that <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, who is up for re-election next year, `` wants to provide the best possible representation to them as well as the entire black population.'' Some civil rights leader were nonetheless astonished at <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON>'s decision to join <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>' staff. `` It's somewhat of a shock to me,'' said <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>. `` I've watched -LRB- <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON>'s -RRB- progression _ or maybe I should say retrogression _ from being a militant civil rights advocate to another stand altogether. But I did n't know he had changed to the point he would fit in with Sen. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>' staff.'' `` Without question, Senator <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> has one of the worst civil rights voting records in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Neas </PERSON> of the Washington-based Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. `` For years he has led the right-wing opposition to effective civil rights laws and remedies. He is a senator markedly out of step with the bipartisan consensus on civil rights in this country.'' While <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON> was battling segregation in the South during the'60s, the conservative <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> was gaining a following as a <ORGANIZATION> Raleigh </ORGANIZATION> television editorialist who harshly criticized the movement to bring about racial change. Since his election to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1972, <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> has vigorously opposed civil rights bills and other domestic programs favored by many blacks. He has defended the white minority government of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, fought making <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s birthday a national holiday and criticized such national black leaders as <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON> entered the all-white <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> after spending nine years in the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. His arrival on campus caused rioting; two people died, and President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> sent in troops and federal marshals. Since then, <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON>, who was wounded during a freedom march in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> in 1965, has held numerous jobs in various parts of the country, most recently living in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, where he worked as a financial planner and tree farmer.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, while accepting a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> call to slash chemical weapons stockpiles, insisted Tuesday on a different approach keyed to halting production of the deadly arms. A cessation of further output of poison gas must be `` part of the parcel,'' senior <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> negotiator <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> said. Even so, the White House welcomed Soviet acceptance of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s initiative. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I am very pleased with the way things are going. ... We've got some good common ground that I do n't think we had before.'' And <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, said the Soviet response `` shows that we are on the same wavelength. It was a very constructive response. Our ultimate objective is total elimination of chemical weapons. And it appears that both nations are now ready to act.'' The Soviet position was outlined by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and then by <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> at a news conference. The two sides disagreed on whether the Soviet plan went beyond <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s initiative. But the two approaches clearly differed in two significant ways. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would have the superpowers retain 2 percent of their chemical weapons until all nations `` capable of building chemical weapons'' sign an international ban. And, as the president explained his proposal Monday in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would keep producing new, binary weapons while destroying older stocks. Binary weapons are deadly, but only when they are mixed. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s move and said, `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, together with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, is ready to go further.'' He called for a cessation of production. At a news conference later, Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> said Soviet acceptance was conditional on a halt to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production of binary weapons. `` It is part of the parcel,'' said <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>, the highest-ranked arms control expert in the Soviet hierarchy. `` It will not be sufficient to get rid of old weapons if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is going to produce new ones.'' A second key difference between the two sides centers on when all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet chemical weapons would be destroyed. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was ready to destroy 98 percent of its weapons in the first eight years of an agreement with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The remaining 2 percent would be retained until 40 nations now negotiating in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreed on a treaty to ban chemical weapons _ and all nations with the capability to produce them signed the pact. This would mean an outright ban depended on the approval of such nations as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, and possibly <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, which the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration says is on the verge of production. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> have been accused of using poison gas in their Persian Gulf War that ended last year. <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> said the Soviets were willing to destroy all their chemical weapons once the treaty was completed. `` We would n't bar the treaty entering into force if there is one nation capable of producing chemical weapons,'' he said. <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> said the Soviets were not helping any country to manufacture chemical weapons. He placed the Soviet arsenal at 50,000 tons. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials have declined to divulge the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> total. The general assumption is that it is about 30,000 tons. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> also called on the two superpowers to `` renounce the use of chemical weapons under any circumstances.'' And, the Soviet foreign minister said, they should employ `` rigorous verification of the cessation of production of chemical warfare agents.' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> agreed last week in talks in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hole </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, on a two-step plan for exchanging information about chemical weapons and for trial inspections of stockpiles. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> had a seven-minute meeting with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> after the foreign minister delivered his speech. He told reporters he had to study the Soviet chemical weapons proposal and that it did not appear to go beyond <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s initiative. But <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> said `` our proposal is a wider one.'' He said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was ready to begin negotiations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to reduce stockpiles on both sides. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, in his speech, welcomed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s initiative and said `` we share the desire to rid mankind of these barbaric weapons.''

 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truly </PERSON> resisted a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee's efforts Tuesday to get him to estimate how much it will cost to go to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>, but complained that congressional cuts in the agency's 1990 budget wo n't help. Noting that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s budget is no more than 1 percent of total federal spending, Truly told the panel that ratio will have to increase if the nation is serious about moving out to the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> again, and beyond to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> Already, he said, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> appropriations committee moves to slash <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 2.05 billion budget request by as much as $ 400 million is forcing the agency to consider slowing its construction schedule for the spacestation that is planned as a forerunner to moon and Mars missions. However, Truly stoutly denied news reports that the pending budget cuts are forcing the agency to redesign the station. `` We're not redesigning the station,'' he said. `` It's more a matter of ... pacing the construction of the station.'' Truly, the first former astronaut to head the space agency, acknowledged that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s goal for a manned mission to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> will take a commitment by a succession of administrations over three or four decades and will be costly. However, he declined to give even a rough guess of how much <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> budgets would have to grow to reach the goal. `` We are not far enough to have a program plan,'' he said to several subcommittee members who pressed him for an estimate. Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the Science, Space and Technology space science subcommittee, predicted the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> budget would have to swell to at least $ 15 billion a year, and perhaps $ 30 billion While supporting the goal of sending a manned mission to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> told Truly it would be better to bypass the moon lest that program eat up too much money. He did not press Truly on that point, however, saying, `` there'll be plenty of time to debate that over the next three years'' before a final decision is made.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Soviet legislature on Tuesday tackled the problem of public anger over private businesses that earn fat profits by providing scarce goods and services. Cooperative businesses are one of the few successes of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic reform program. They have grown dramatically since they were legalized 2 -LCB- years ago and now provide $ 20 billion worth of goods and services, Deputy Premier <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON> said Tuesday. But decades of propaganda instilled into many Soviets a strong feeling that earning a profit is evil. Deputy <PERSON> Veniamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Yarin </PERSON> of <PERSON> Nizhni </PERSON> <PERSON> Tagilsk </PERSON> pointed up the mood of much of the public when he said cooperatives engage in `` open robbery of the working man.'' The cooperatives' exemption from state-controlled prices and the high wages paid to their employees reinforce public resentment. Some cooperatives are victims of extortion by organized crime. Others are fronts for thieves. Even <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> asked the legislature how the cooperatives manage to find soap when no one else can. And he noted that the cooperative price might be 5 rubles -LRB- about $ 7.75 -RRB- for a bar of soap, when a state store would charge 40 kopecks -LRB- 62 cents -RRB- to 1 ruble -LRB- $ 1.55 -RRB-. `` We have to take into account the mood of the people,'' he said, as the legislators began debating proposed amendments that would give local governments more power to regulate cooperatives. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> stood by his creations, however. `` The main thing for us is to preserve cooperatives,'' he said. `` People see the evident difference between them. Those providing services, manufacturing, producing construction materials, repairing, helping, are more than welcome by the people. All those intermediary cooperatives are considered to be thieves. What is the way out of this situation? `` If we do not set this matter in order, we will doom the cooperative movement.'' One deputy even proposed closing down all wholesale and retail cooperatives, but this was defeated, the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We educate people to be engineers and they sit in public restrooms and collect 20 kopecks -LRB- 31 cents -RRB- for each visitor who comes to execute his natural functions,'' said Deputy <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Sukhov </PERSON>. He was referring to both the high prices charged by cooperatives and the high wages paid to their employees, which entice talented people into leaving jobs in state enterprises. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the deputies he was faced with an `` ultimatum'' on cooperatives when he met last week with workers and collective farmers who are members of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s central bodies. But Deputy <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobchak </PERSON>, head of the legal faculty at <ORGANIZATION> Leningrad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said cooperatives in some areas were facing wholesale closure by local governments that were ignoring the law. <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s closest economic advisers, told the deputies that `` cooperatives are making the first step toward forming a socialist market, which we have been talking about for so long.'' He argued problems that cause public outrage over cooperatives actually are the problems of the entire Soviet economy, such as severe shortages of basic goods and services. <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON> said Soviet society must recognize that cooperatives are an important part of the economy, agree to treat them equally with state business, and allow local governments to regulate them in order to take into account local needs and viewpoints. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said these amendments and another regulating wages paid by cooperatives were sent to a legislative committee for refinement. The 542-member, two-chamber Supreme Soviet, presided over by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, has reconvened at a time of widespread turmoil and discontent caused by the demands of ethnic groups and by the state economy's failure to meet many basic needs. The legislature also created a commission to review press coverage of Deputy <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s tour of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Pravda stirred up a storm when it reprinted an Italian newspaper's article charging <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> with drinking and shopping his way across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> Pravda later apologized, but some deputies have called for the resignation of Pravda editor <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Afanasiev </PERSON>.

 The government of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> has retreated from its demand for a 50 percent reduction in its $ 21 billion debt, hoping to rejuvenate stalled negotiations with commercial banks, officials said Tuesday. Instead, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> will offer banks `` a broad menu of options'' that will include lesser discounts in exchange for weaker guarantees of remaining debt, said Venezuelan planning minister <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Fandeo </PERSON>, who is in charge of his country's debt-reduction effort He also announced that a consortium of 15 banks has agreed to a $ 600 million short-term loan to allow <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> to catch up with missed interest payments by Dec. 31. The government is contributing $ 400 million from its reserves to wiping out the missed payments, he said. Briefing reporters at the annual meeting of the 152-nation <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and its sister organization, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> insisted that the new strategy did not mean <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> had retreated from its goal of `` the largest possible reduction in debt and debt service.'' Debt reduction is the keystone of Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s initiative, announced in March, a month after bloody riots in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> focused attention on the plight of developing countries mired by a crushing $ 1.3 trillion debt burden. Because of the riots, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> was one of the first countries singled out for debt reduction by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, but commercial banks have concluded pacts with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> first. Bankers have accused <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> of being intransigent in its demands. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, in an afternoon speech to <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> delegates, admonished both developing countries and their creditors toward flexibility, citing discussions between banks and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. `` An important challenge at the moment appears to be the problem of unrealistic expectations _ both among debtor countries and the banks,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. `` In one sense, improving expectations was essential to restoring forward momentum in the debt strategy. ... In another sense, however, we must recognize that rising expectations need to be tempered by realism.'' `` Excessive expectations can only promote delays, increase the risk of breakdown in negotiations and ultimately raise the economic costs to the banks and debtor countries,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said his country will continue to offer to buy back its loans in cash in exchange for a 60 percent discount and issue guaranteed bonds for a 50 percent debt reduction. However, it will also be willing to accept a lower discount if banks accept bonds with weaker guarantees than the 50 percent bonds. In addition, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> will accept new loans from the banks, but only to the extent necessary to compensate for debt reduction less than 50 percent, the planning minister said. He said his country is shifting its policy in hope of accommodating banks which, because of tax and other regulations, are unable to take a 50 percent loss on the loans. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said the new strategy should allow a greater number of banks to participate in a debt-reduction pact, which he said <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> would like to conclude by the end of the year. The $ 600 million short-term loan was offered by 15 banks, led by <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s central bank

And eight <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats, including the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, proposed forgiving <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s $ 2 billion agricultural debt to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and providing food aid beyond the $ 100 million in assistance proposed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. As outlined in a letter to the president, the proposal calls for the donation of $ 150 million in corn, grain, sorghum, wheat, butter and pork products to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and urges authorization of an additional $ 150 million in assistance. It also calls for the extension of preferential tariff treatment for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the extension of technical aid through the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The legislators, led by Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman, also challenged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> private industry to make available $ 10 million to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in money and equipment `` The president's plan is a welcome but stop-gap effort that fails to give <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> the long-term help it needs to restructure its agricultural economy and to sustain the world's newest democracy,'' <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said. The letter was signed by <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON>, D-S.; <PERSON> Quentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, D-La; <PERSON> Spark </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Nevada </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>. Speaking with reporters after his half-hour meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, West German Finance Minister <PERSON> Theo </PERSON> <PERSON> Waigel </PERSON> said the two had discussed ways to reduce the Polish debt. <PERSON> Waigel </PERSON> said he told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> should help. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> owes about $ 10 billion to commercial banks and the rest to other governments, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> offered earlier this week to help <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> privatize its state-owned industry and set up new banks and markets. There is general agreement that the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> will have to assess <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s situation before there can be any large-scale international help. Officials of Solidarity, the main force behind the new government, have said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> needs at least $ 10 billion over three years. <PERSON> Waigel </PERSON> also said he told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that there should be a strengthening of market forces in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and that the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> should help. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is discussing giving <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> credits and credit guarantees to supply projects that would stimulate the economy, <PERSON> Waigel </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Two B-2 Tests Cut Short</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Two B-2 stealth bomber test flights were cut short last week, once because of a renewed oil-pressure problem and once because of high winds, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. A planned 5 -LCB- - hour flight Sept. 21 was scrubbed after three hours after indications of low oil pressure in the plane's No 1 airframe accessory drive, said <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. The bat-wing bomber is designed to pass through enemy radar virtually undetected. The accessory drive is the gear box that powers the jet's generators and controls. The same problem had forced the crew to scub the second test flight of the $ 530 million plane on Aug. 16. `` As with the second flight, the B-2 was landed early as a precaution,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` The flight crew was in no danger.'' Four new casings were installed for the stealth's fifth test flight Saturday, and no oil-pressure problems were encountered, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. However, that flight ended after 77 minutes `` because of gusty winds at the altitude at which the plane was flying,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> said, adding that he could not say what the wind strengths were. It was decided to cut that flight short as a precaution because of the stress being placed on the bomber during the particular maneuvers being conducted, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` That does n't mean that the plane ca n't fly at high winds,'' he said. The crew did complete an air-refueling test under which the bat-wing jet purposely stopped just short of its refueling KC-10 aircraft. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the stealth wo n't be flown again for at least five weeks while `` planned modifications'' and ground vibration tests are done. The plane has flown a total of 12 hours, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> says -LRB- the stealth -RRB- has performed better than expected in areas of handling qualities, especially smooth aircraft control in the fueling position,'' he said. When questioned, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> had n't said in which areas the plane has n't performed up to expectations. The government has spent about $ 22.4 billion in the B-2 program, which is 18 months behind schedule, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has balked at paying more than $ 500 million each for 132 bombers. Shrouded in secrecy for 10 years, manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> have begun an an intensive campaign to counter those who question the plane's capabilities. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> wants $ 4.7 billion for the bomber in the coming fiscal year, and may need $ 8 billion in each of the three years of peak production, 1992 -

 The House began debate Tuesday on a huge budget bill weighed down by such unconnected issues as catastrophic illness insurance, child care, pornographic telephone services and the fight over President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s capital gains tax cut. `` It's so full of irrelevancies, it is hardly recognizable'' as a budget bill, said Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Minn </LOCATION>. `` Let the games begin,'' he added, as debate began In an unusual procedure, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> opened debate on the bill before agreeing to a schedule for the amendments. The budget portion is designed to reduce the fiscal 1990 federal deficit by $ 16.6 billion. During the day, Democratic leaders scrambled to find more votes for their amendment which would derail the capital gains tax cut. House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said reaction to the Democratic alternative, which would raise tax rates for the wealthy to restore deductions for Individual Retirement Accounts, was `` encouraging.'' From the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, however, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sent letters to all <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members calling his tax cut `` the right policy for all Americans'' and saying he would veto the Democratic alternative should it be approved. A vote on that provision, originally slated for Wednesday, was delayed at least until Thursday while the behind-the-scenes political wrangling continued. Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Slattery </PERSON>, D-Kan., who opposes the Bush-backed plan to drop the maximum capital gains rate from 33 percent to 19.6 percent for the next 27 months, conceded the Democrats did n't have the votes `` But the other side has n't got the votes yet either,'' he said. While capital gains has been the most partisan fight, other issues have broad public impact, including at least three competing child care amendments. The House is retreating from past actions with an amendment expected next week to repeal the new <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> catastrophic health insurance program. Elderly groups have protested the new taxes levied on the elderly to pay for their additional coverage. Business groups have lobbied successfully for a repeal of rules mandating non-discrimination in their health plans. Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> was `` signaling our willingness to bow to any special interest group that is aggressive and single-minded enough to hound us into submission. `` But my disappointment with this bill ... is minor when compared to my disappointment with the president,'' <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> said. `` The president has squandered the first year of his presidency on symbolic victories.'' `` What will he have to show for it at the end of this year?'' <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> said. `` Legislation to protect the flag from a handful of misguided exhibitionists, a blueprint for a drug war that is doomed for failure because he refuses to pay for it, a plan to sail to Mars, and if he gets his way, and a tax cut for the wealthiest 5 percent of our population in a year when our deficit exceeds $ 130 billion.'' Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, called on lawmakers to stick with the bill even if they do n't like some of the provisions or amendments If the bill is not `` enacted in some form,'' he reminded the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the Gramm-Rudman law will require more than $ 16 billion in automatic spending cuts in both domestic and military programs. The law mandates those cuts if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president fail to reduce the deficit to within $ 10 billion of the $ 100 billion target for fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1. The deficit reduction is supposed to be in place by Oct. 15, but <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said Tuesday he did n't expect that do be done. The result will be what he said will be `` a sort of technical'' cutback, but he expected the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and administration to work out their differences to avoid any permanent reductions.

<HEAD>Bus Operators Say Service Could Be Cut Because Of Law For Disabled</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Operators of private bus companies complained Tuesday before a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that the proposed Americans With Disabilities Act could force them to cut service, especially to the poor and rural dwellers. Most of the testimony centered on the requirements under the proposed legislation that inter-city bus fleets be made accessible to the disabled within six or seven years of enactment. The bus operators interpret that requirement as a mandate that all buses be equipped with wheelchair lifts, which they say cost from $ 10,000 to $ 35,000 per bus to install, not to mention maintenance costs. `` The mandatory lift requirement, with its attendant costs, including installation, seat loss, and possible package express loss, would spell the end of intercity bus service in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The operators are proposing alternatives, such as a system of leasing equipped buses or having a limited number in the fleet, making those buses available on call. Advocates for the disabled say they have the same right to spontaneous travel that others have, and a reservations system or other limited availability would prevent that. With 200,000 buses in the total fleet operated by members of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the cost of installing lifts would would range from $ 20 million to $ 70 million, said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Wilkes-Barre </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>. He told the surface transportation subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> that by contrast, the industry had operating income of $ 41.5 million from 1982-1986. The bus operators say the installation of wheelchair lifts would result in the loss of up to four revenue-producing seats, not to mention cargo and luggage space and modifying restrooms. Owners also testified that where wheelchair access was in place, demand was minimal. Advocates for the disabled told the subcommittee, however, that the bill does not specify wheelchair lifts, but added that the lift technology is so advanced that the cost estimates given by the industry are exaggerated. Most of the testimony Tuesday and in a hearing by the subcommittee last week dealt with the costs of lifts. A German-designed lift used on <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> buses costs $ 11,000, removes only one seat and occupies no baggage space, said <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Golden </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Disability </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> and Defense Fund. She also said there is no requirement to modify restrooms, adding that the disabled have had long experience coping without bathrooms. She and several other witnesses disputed the claims of low ridership, saying the disabled have been conditioned not be be able to expect to travel. `` It takes time for them to believe the word ` Yes','' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Winski </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> with Disabilities.

 Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> on Tuesday accepted President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call for deep U.S.-Soviet chemical arms cuts and challenged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to go further and faster. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will `` radically reduce or completely destroy'' its chemical weapons, halt nuclear tests and stop making weapons-grade plutonium and uranium _ all if <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> reciprocates. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, speaking to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, said the two governments have narrowed their differences and he predicted that by the U.S.-Soviet summit next spring or summer, `` We may have passed the last turn on the road'' toward a treaty reducing strategic arms by 50 percent. There was a quick response from the White House. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I am very pleased with the way things are going. The reaction from the Soviets to our proposals yesterday has been positive so now the goal is to get moving and try to work out these agreements.'' White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> called <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s statements `` a very constructive response. Our ultimate objective is total elimination of chemical weapons. And it appears that both nations are now ready to act.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> also said that if <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries agree to start talks on tactical nuclear weapons, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will respond by further unilateral cuts in its tactical nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He repeated his government's call for a nuclear test ban and said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was considering extending a 1963 treaty to cover underground nuclear explosions. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> later praised <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s nearly hour-long address as `` a good speech, an interesting speech.'' He called it `` very responsive to the President's statement'' on chemical weapons. But <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s chief arms control expert, told reporters, `` Our proposal is a wider one'' and does not wait to destroy all weapons or halt production until all nations capable of producing them have signed a ban. `` It will not be sufficient only to get rid of old weapons if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is going to produce new chemical weapons,'' <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Monday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will destroy more than 80 percent of its chemical weapons, before an international treaty banning use of the weapons is signed, if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will reduce its arms to a similar level. That would mean greater cuts by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which has a larger stockpile. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in the first eight years of a chemical weapons treaty, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be ready to destroy 98 percent of its arsenal if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> joins the ban. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would destroy all chemical weapons within 10 years once every nation capable of building the weapons signs the treaty, he said. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said: `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is ready, together with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, to go further and assume mutual obligations prior to the conclusion of a multilateral convention.'' The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> offered to: _ Cease production of chemical weapons, as it says it already has done, including more sophisticated binary weapons. _ Renounce the use of `` those barbaric weapons'' under any circumstances. _ Institute rigorous verification of the cessation of production. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> praised the U.S.-Soviet dialogue and said progress had been made in recent talks. `` These talks have demonstrated the increasing awareness by both sides of the need to cooperate for the benefit of mankind and the growing confidence that such cooperation is possible.'' Agreement to hold a summit meeting next year, he said, `` shows that we have moved quite far ahead in solving a number of major bilateral and international problems.'' But he said extraordinary efforts at the highest level will be needed to conclude an agreement on a 50 percent reduction in strategic offensive arms. `` Our partners have accommodated us on mobile intercontinental balistic missiles, he said. `` Positions on other outstanding problems have become closer to each other. `` In our view, by the time the summit is held next year in late spring or early summer, we may have passed the last turn on the road toward a treaty reducing strategic offensive arms.'' In a speech that praised the right of a people to choose its government and course of development, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> also wished `` every success'' to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s new government, the first <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc government not led by Communists. He pledged to cooperate with it. He also praised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Open Skies proposal, which would allow both nations to fly surveillance missions over the other's territory `` We like it ... The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> calls for opening up the lands, the waters and outer space. Let us have Open Lands, Open Seas and Open Space. Only then shall we attain absolute transparency and the necessary level of confidence.''

 The spokesman of the leading political party was shot and killed Tuesday, and a Marxist guerrilla group claimed responsibility. The killing of <PERSON> Pavlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakoyannis </PERSON> took place hours before <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> was scheduled to debate the biggest bank scandal in the nation's history. The guerrilla group, called November 17, has accused <PERSON> Bakoyannis </PERSON> of having a role in the scandal. Police said <PERSON> Bakoyannis </PERSON> was shot at least five times in the chest and stomach with a 45-caliber pistol from close range in the hallway of his downtown office. The 54-year-old former journalist and magazine publisher was rushed to the <LOCATION> Evangelismos </LOCATION> hospital, where he died on the operating table, police said. <PERSON> Bakoyannis </PERSON> was elected to the 300-member unicameral Parliament in June. He was the spokesman for the conservative <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> party headed by his father-in-law, <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON>. November 17 claimed responsibility in a 11 -LCB- - page proclamation scattered near the scene of the shooting The group first surfaced with the assassination of <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> CIA station chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> in 1975. It also claimed responsibility for the killing in June 1988 of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense attache <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nordeen </PERSON>. The group takes its name from the day in 1973 when students at the <ORGANIZATION> Athens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> rose against the military dictatorship that ruled from 1967 until it collapsed in 1974. It accused <PERSON> Bakoyannis </PERSON>, 54, of connections to a banker linked to a scandal that contributed to the defeat in June elections of the Socialist administration of former Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>. After <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s defeat, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> party forged a governing alliance with the Communist-led Coalition of the Left and Progress. The coalition is led by Prime Minister <PERSON> Tzannis </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzannetakis </PERSON>, a deputy in <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON>' party. Witnesses told police that two men had apparently been waiting for <PERSON> Bakoyannis </PERSON> as he entered the building where his political office is located. One witness said he heard many shots. Another told police that after the gunshots, two men casually walked out of the building to a waiting car about 50 yards away and drove off. Police said later that the getaway car was found abandoned about a mile from the scene of the shooting. <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> rushed to the hospital along with his wife, <PERSON> Marika </PERSON>, minutes after he learned his son-in-law had been shot. He was joined later by his daughter, <PERSON> Dora </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bakoyannis </PERSON>' wife. The murder delayed for several hours the beginning of a two-day debate on evidence allegedly linking <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> and four of his senior <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members to the $ 210 million <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION> embezzlement scandal. The former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON>, has accused <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> and his ministers of skimming off interest from deposits made by state-controlled corporations. He is in a Salem, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. prison awaiting extradition to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. The debate is to end Wednesday, when <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> is to vote on whether to indict the accused and send them to a special high court for trial.

 Colombian President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>, facing escalating violence by drug lords in his country, will meet with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the White House on Thursday evening. Barco will stop in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on his way to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to address the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, White House press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Tuesday The visit comes as bombings and violence continue to rock the drug-trafficking plagued <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nation, in the wake of <ORGANIZATION> Barco </ORGANIZATION>'s crackdown to rid <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> of drugs. On Monday and Tuesday, three explosions, attributed to drug traffickers, blasted <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, killing two people. Asked if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would press Barco to request help from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops, beyond the military equipment the administration already is sending, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said no. `` We have said from the beginning we would respond only to requests by the president. We respect his rights and wishes as president of that country, and whether or not he requests any more aid in terms of money or troops or whatever is entirely within his purview,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The recent bombings, the spokesman said, `` are an exclamation point to the danger there and to the desperation that the country faces in terms of its drug problem. It strengthens the commitment of everyone to continue the fight.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has repeatedly expressed verbal support for <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s efforts against the drug traffickers and recently ordered $ 65 million in military equipment and weaponry be sent to assist him. He also has requested $ 251 million from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for next year to help <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> in their drug wars. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>, in addition to the drug situation, will talk about trade and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will meet with Barco in the residence quarters of the White House after his return from the two-day education summit meeting with the nation's governors in <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>.

 The 24 nations pooling aid for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> agreed Tuesday on the urgency of introducing more measures to support political and economic reforms in the two East-bloc countries. In a final communique at the end of a one-day meeting, senior officials from the 24 donor nations also urged <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to reach agreements with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> to reschedule their foreign debts. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s foreign debt is about $ 18 billion _ the highest per capita in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> _ and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s foreign debt is a debilitating $ 39 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s executive commission, which is coordinating the aid efforts _ has said rescheduling debts is outside its mandate. The communique noted that $ 271 million worth of food aid has been pledged by the 24 nations to be delivered to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. It was the second meeting by the 24 nations with another scheduled for November. European Community officials put a $ 648 million price tag on the new aid plan with half to be financed by the 12 <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> member states and the remainder by the 12 other donor nations. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation, which did not announce any new measures to add to the $ 169 million already pledged, indicated it could find additional funds and said the $ 648 million should be seen as a minimum amount, not a ceiling. By the end of the meeting $ 133 million was promised by <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> proposed paying $ 216 million from its 1990 budget toward the new plan and suggested the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s 12 members could provide $ 108 million more on a bilateral basis. The other donors also would supply $ 324 million. <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Delors </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> executive commission, and <PERSON> Frans </PERSON> <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> external relations commisisoner, issued a statement calling the process of political reform and economic liberalization in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> `` still very fragile.'' They said Poles and Hungarians `` could well find their new freedoms threatened by economic disorders.'' `` It would be unthinkable to allow such disorders, which could be alleviated through rapid action, to undermine the prospects for change in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' they added. Following are major provisions of the five-point air program proposed Tuesday: _ To supply such goods as pesticides and farm machinery in addition to food being sent to the Polish government. The food is to be shipped free on condition the government uses the money from sales to improve the private farm sector. _ To improve market access for Polish and Hungarian goods by eliminating quantitative restrictions on their exports and offering trade concessions. _ To grant both countries loans from the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and include them in loan operations usually reserved for developing nations. _ To provide professional training including banking and customs to prepare <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> for market-oriented economies. _ Cooperation to clean up industrialized areas and preserve historical and cultural sites in both countries. <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> participitation in the plan requires approval by the 12 governments and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. The other donor nations that also must approve the proposals are the six members of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, along with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>.

 Former President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, who is dying of liver cancer, was in stable condition Tuesday after suffering another relapse, according to his doctors. `` <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> is on oxygen and suffering from fever,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Saca </PERSON>. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, 63, came down with pneumonia last week but responded to treatment with antibiotics. He was taken to a private hospital Tuesday for lung X-rays and other examinations. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s son <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> told photographers that his father `` has had a relapse but the relapse is not serious. He is breathing normally, he is conscious and apparently has a lung problem.'' <PERSON> Saca </PERSON> said <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> will be transferred to <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for a checkup in about 10 days `` when his general condition improves.'' He said the trip would be made to evaluate the cancer and decide whether to resume chemotherapy. `` We doctors here consider that there is no need to give him more chemotherapy because the cancer is no longer being controlled,'' <PERSON> Saca </PERSON> said. When doctors at <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> diagnosed <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s cancer in June 1988 they removed 60 percent of his stomach and found that the disease had invaded his liver.

 Less than 24 hours after President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> forcefully threatened to resolve the feud between <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, cargo trains began running to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> ending an economic blockade. Azerbaijani interference with cargo on the rail route into <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> had tightened to a total blockade over the past several weeks. The Soviet evening news program Vremya on Tuesday said 14 trains arrived in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> Monday night and Tuesday, delivering food, medicine, newsprint and construction material desperately needed in the area of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> devastated by last December's earthquake. But the film showed potatoes in the railroad cars were rotting and crawling with maggots after three weeks of sitting outdoors. The Vremya correspondent said none of the railcars contained fuel, also critically needed. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> warned at Monday's session of the Soviet legislature that the government would take tougher, unspecified steps to settle the Armenian-Azerbaijani dispute if the two republics can not do it themselves quickly. He did not elaborate. More than 100 people have been killed in ethnic violence in the two republics the past 19 months, with much of the conflict centering on the disputed territory of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. Newspapers in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the Armenian capital, stopped publishing last week for lack of newsprint and reconstruction in the earthquake zone came to a standstill because of a shortage of materials. Neither Soviet television nor the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> gave any explanation of how the trains reached their destinations after weeks of delay. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said 17 trains left for <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, between 6 p.m. Monday and 6 p.m. Tuesday. It said their 750 railcars contained construction supplies, food, vehicles, machinery and other cargo.

<HEAD>`Reverse Discrimination' Suit Filed By White Police Officers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES O. CLIFFORD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Seven white police officers have sued the city, charging that less qualified minority officers were promoted unfairly ahead of them under a court-ordered affirmative action plan. It could be the first test of a recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that reversed 20 years of affirmative action. Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyemant </PERSON> said Tuesday he filed the `` reverse discrimination'' suit against the city on behalf of the seven officers Monday in order to obtain `` a colorblind and sex-blind opportunity to advance.'' <PERSON> Gyemant </PERSON> said the officers, standing with him at a news conference, would most or all be captains or lieutenants if they had been given an equal opportunity to advance. All are patrol officers. The suit, filed Monday in <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, claims less qualified minority officers have been unfairly promoted in order to meet racial quotas set by a 1979 court-ordered affirmative action plan. The suit maintains that the city has violated a state civil rights law forbidding the use of race or sex as a basis in hiring and promotion. `` All I want is the opportunity to compete fairly,'' said Officer <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratti </PERSON>. Also at the news conference were four white female officers who said they, too, suffered from discrimination. They are not involved in the lawsuit. Officer <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> described the city's promotion policies as `` a lottery.'' <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, a 13-year veteran of the force, said she was one of the first women in the department who `` passed standards held for men.'' The lawsuit seeks back pay, punitive damages and an end to the alleged discrimination. The amount of damages sought was not revealed. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> suit may be the first test case for the landmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision involving <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, that permitted a legal challenge to a court-order affirmative action plan. The court decided that white firefighters in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, hired after a consent decree was approved, could fight the preferential promotion of allegedly less qualified black firefighters. Gyemant, who called racial discrimination `` awful,'' said his clients should not be forced to pay the price to `` right wrongs'' carried out before any of them were involved with the department. City Attorney <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Renne </PERSON> said the lawsuit `` is plowing old ground.'' `` This has been going on for 10 years,'' she said. `` Just about every legal point that could possibly have been raised has been.'' But Gyemant responded: `` If it is old ground, then it certainly is about time that we're able to deal with this in courts of law.'' Only one sergeant's examination has been given in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Police </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Departmant </LOCATION> in the last 10 years, and that was declared recially discriminatory against whites by a federal judge, he said. The lawsuit is not designed to fight steps taken to end discrimination, <PERSON> Gyemant </PERSON> said. `` All we are saying is why make our clients pay for it. All they did was serve the city well. That's what the lawsuit is all about,'' he said.

 The Slovenian communist leadership on Tuesday unanimously endorsed proposed changes in the republic's constitution that would give <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> the right to secede from <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency said In addition, the federal presidency would have to seek Slovenian approval to use <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> army units in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> radio said the Central Committee of the republic's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` expressed its determination'' to allow a final vote on the amendments in the Slovenian parliament on Wednesday Under the proposed amendments, <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> would have `` a lasting and inalienable right to self-determination, including the right to secession,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> reported. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s collective eight-member presidency twice in the past week issued statements saying the suggested amendments clashed with the federal charter. The charter provides for the right of each of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s six republics to secede, without specifying how this could be accomplished. The national policy-setting <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meanwhile met in special session in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> and wrangled over procedural issues regarding the proposed constitutional amendments in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s westernmost republic Slovenian and Serbian party chiefs engaged in a sharp exchange. Slovenian party leader <PERSON> Milan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kucan </PERSON> said including the issue on the agenda amounted to `` political pressure and restriction of the sovereign will of the Slovenian people.'' <PERSON> Bogdan </PERSON> <PERSON> Trifunovic </PERSON>, leader of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s largest <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, said he considered <PERSON> Kucan </PERSON>'s speech an open declaration of hostilities. The Slovenian leadership said Tuesday the amendments in no way contradicted the federal constitution. In a statement carried by <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>'s ruling presidency said federal criticism of the proposed changes could be construed as indicating that the authorities were prepared to use force to block their adoption. According to a report from <LOCATION> Ljubljana </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, the Slovenian party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> openly rejected criticism by the federal authorities.

 <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> on Tuesday decried Moslem vs. Moslem violence and said guns, bombs and extremism should only be used to fight the enemies of Islam. The official Libyan news agency <PERSON> Jana </PERSON>, monitored in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> told an Islamic seminar in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> that fighting between Moslem factions only benefits enemies of the faith. There is in Islam a `` multitude of contradicting movements ... some of which we made, some the Americans made and some were made by the Mossad or the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said, referring to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mossad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> secret police. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> said the movements include fundamentalists who want to return to the Islamic basics and maintain the religion's traditions, morals and customs and other factions that have taken `` a secret, violent, terrorist and extremist trend'' for reasons of power or wealth `` If such extremism was against the enemies of Islam, then we all must be extremists and choose violence against the Israelis to liberate the Holy Land and Palestine ... against the Americans and against the enemies of Islam to stop them where they are,'' he said. <PERSON> Jana </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> addressed some 250 Moslem clerics, activists and leaders from 48 countries who went to the Libyan capital for the seminar sponsored by the World Council for Islamic Call and the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. The agency quoted <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> as saying, `` This religion is dying if it resorts to bombs, guns, knives, working in the dark and sabotaging Islamic activity from the inside. ...

<HEAD>Bush's Campaign Spending Reforms Sent to Congress</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The White House on Tuesday sent <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the legislative package containing Presidnet <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign spending reforms announced earlier this summer. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is proposing to abolish nearly all special-interest political action committees, which are the source of millions of dollars in campaign funds for congressional candidates. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal also would bar personal use of leftover campaign funds, curtail free mailing privileges enjoyed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and do away with gerrymandering, the drawing of crazy-quilt congressional districts to benefit certain candidates. The package also would prevent candidates from rolling over campaign funds from one election to the next, a practice that helps many incumbents scare off challengers. To infuse more money into the system, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would allow the national political parties to spend more on their congressional candidates than current election law allows. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also wants full public disclosure of so-called soft money, which refers to funds that are prohibited in federal campaigns but permitted at the state or local level in many cases. Critics contend that soft money contributions find their way into the federal election process anyway. In a statement to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> accompanying the package, he said his proposals were `` designed to reduce substantially the power of special economic interests while enhancing the role of individuals and political parties.'' On political action committees, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would specifically ban federal contributions from PACs sponsored by unions, corporations and trade associations. Critics contend that campaign donations from these PACs give them undue influence over the votes of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> members who receive them. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced the proposals in June and put them into legislative form that he sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. He also has announced his support for a pay raise for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> members, but has sent no specific proposal, leaving that effort to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> itself.

In a separate document, he called for a `` mobilization'' by Catholics for <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and announced a world day of prayer for this war-torn country. Under a peace plan issued by a three-man <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s surviving 73 <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> members will meet Saturday in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> to discuss the reform plans. Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, a Shiite Moslem, predicted at least 60 lawmakers would participate. The reforms are designed to give more power to Moslems in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Maronite Catholics have dominated the government, judiciary and army command in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943. <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> militia leader <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> attacked the proposals, which were welcomed by other Lebanese politicians. `` The military battle is not over yet and will not be finished on the basis of a new fragile sectarian compromise contained in the tripartite committee's draft plan,'' <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> told a group of sympathizers. <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> said in a statement the reform plan was `` not enough.'' `` The constitution which they want to change gives us more than the <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> tripartite committee's plan for reforms,'' <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> complained. Under the present system, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is governed by a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> president, with a Sunni Moslem prime minister and a <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker. Many government jobs were allocated on the basis of a ratio of six Christians to five Moslems. At the time the arrangement came about, Christians formed a majority of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s population. Now they are outnumbered by Moslems. According to the daily paper An-Nahar, the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> peace committee has worked out a plan under which the number of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> seats would be increased from 99 to 128, to be distributed equally between Moslems and Christians. The reforms would limit the president's authority in naming and dismissing Moslem prime ministers and would stipulate that they be elected by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> An-Nahar </ORGANIZATION> reported. The present 99-seat Parliament was elected in 1972, three years before civil war broke out. Sectarian strife has prevented general elections and the house has periodically voted to renew its four-year mandate. Twenty-six vacancies now exist. A <ORGANIZATION> Sunni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> member, speaking on condition he not be further identified, said leaders of the militias and other fighting forces `` are against any settlement because it will strip them of the privileges they enjoyed when their men ruled <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by rifle.''

 More than two-thirds of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> urged the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration Tuesday to deny any visa request from <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to address the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Fifty-eight <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members also wrote to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, contending <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> should be denied a visa because he has not lived up to his December promises to renounce terrorism and to recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. The 68 senators, 34 Democrats and 34 Republicans, made the same point in a letter to Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and added: `` The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is on a collision course with the peace process. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> must reaffirm and implement, in deed and in word, the statements of just nine months ago. `` Rewarding the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> at this time would undercut the peace process, call into question the seriousness of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> anti-terrorism policy, be -LRB- contrary -RRB- to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> interests and threaten the security of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' Both groups of lawmakers noted that former Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had denied <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> a visa to address the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> last November. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> cited a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law giving the government the right to deny entry to anyone believed to have engaged in terrorism, either as an individual or as a member of an organization. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has not applied for a visa this year but is widely expected to do so. The denial of his visa request last year led to an uproar at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and an invitation for him to address a specially convened <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> session in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. At a news conference, several of the lawmakers who signed the letters said their intention was not to derail the dialogue between <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats underway since his December pledge. `` This is not a message to halt the dialogue, but it is a message that we want the dialogue to produce results,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, D-Calif. Sen. <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>., noted that the number of senators requesting <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> be denied a visa was 17 higher than the number who had signed a similar letter to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> last `` This is an indication there is less trust for Mr. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> today and an indication we believe his words are hollow,'' <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., dismissed reports that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> had agreed to endorse the terms of a 10-point peace proposal initiated By <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> `` Talk is cheap,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. Signing the letter to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> were 34 Democrats and 34 Republicans. Democrats, in order of signing: Sens. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>, D-Conn.; <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich.; <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Ky.; <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>; <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, D-Wis.; <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>; <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill.; <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, D-Nev.; <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, D-N.D.; <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, D-Tenn.; <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, D-Ala.; <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>; Also, Sens. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Quentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON>, D-N.D.: <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON>, D-S.; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON>, D-Ala.; <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Del; <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, D-Nev.; <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn.; <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>,; <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, D-Va.; <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont; <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich.; <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Stay In Shelter Can't Jeopardize Food Stamps</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A brief stay in a battered women's shelter ca n't jeopardize food stamp benefits, a federal judge ruled. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLaughlin </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> violated its own regulations when it directed a cutoff of food stamps for two women this year after they left shelters for battered women. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said payments by the state to battered women's shelters had to be considered income when calculating the food stamp eligibility of individual women who use the shelters. But <PERSON> MacLaughlin </PERSON> ruled Monday that the state's per-day payments to 16 shelters around the state should be considered emergency assistance, not a substitute for the shelter costs that are part of a family's welfare grant. `` A battered woman does not come to a shelter to find housing,'' he wrote. `` She comes because she needs protection from imminent physical danger and help in ending an abusive relationship.'' The judge said fewer than half of the women who seek shelter can be accommodated by existing facilities and the average stay is only 13 days. He gave the federal government and the <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> 60 days to come up with a plan for giving back to welfare recipients the food stamps that were wrongfully withheld from them while the policy was in effect, from Aug. 1, 1988, to April 1 of this year. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, an attorney with <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Mankato </LOCATION>, sued on behalf of the two women from that southern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> city of about 29,000 people. He said the lawsuit was a class action involving about 2,000 women and children in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> who were hurt by the policy. The ruling requires they be identified and reimbursed, he said. For one of the <LOCATION> Mankato </LOCATION> women, the amount was $ 250; for the other, $ 124, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` While we may not look at the amount as especially significant, to these women it may mean survival,'' said Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> said the state agreed with <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>' position that the shelter services should not be considered income but was forced to go along with the federal interpretation or face sanctions `` There was more at stake here besides benefits,'' said <PERSON> Loretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON>, director of legal advocacy for the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Coalition for Battered Women. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> said the federal policy had the `` absurd result'' of forcing women to choose between getting their children out of an unsafe home or feeding them. Some women were not going into shelters, or were leaving shortly after getting into them, because they could not afford to go without food stamps, she said.

<HEAD>State Sets Fat Content Standards For Lunches</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> law sets a limit on the amount of fat allowed in school lunches and was the result of a lawmaker's shock at the quality of food served at a school in her district. The law, which goes into effect Jan. 1, requires the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> to set fat and cholesterol levels for all school lunches, and orders the board to force the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s 1,000-plus school districts to follow the standards. The legislation is aimed at high-fat, low-food-value lunches that often serve as the sole source of a child's daily nourishment. The bill was signed last week by the governor. `` I'm sad to say that for many children, the school lunch they eat is the most balanced meal they receive all day,'' said <PERSON> Assemblywoman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Speier </PERSON>, author of the law. `` This is particularly alarming when that lunch consists of a corn dog and tater tots.'' A group called The <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, has issued a report that says the federal government supplies about a third of the food used in more than 24 million lunches served daily at 91,000 schools. The foods include high-fat content items such as ground beef, pork, luncheon meat, ham, butter, cheese and eggs. Health authorities generally agree that the daily fat intake for school children should be no more than 30 percent of total calories.

<HEAD>US Inviting Soviets To See Star Wars Research</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiator to the superpower Defense and Space Talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> said Tuesday he hopes the Soviets will accept a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invitation to visit two Star Wars research sites. `` I would be hopeful ... that we could work out the arrangements in the coming round so that the trip could take place in the coming months,'' Ambassador <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> told reporters at a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> briefing. The negotiator discussed the invitation extended by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> in his talks over the weekend with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said he intends to press ahead with the offer in the new round of <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks, which begin Friday. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> had reacted positively to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s invitation, but that he could not characterize the Soviet reaction as an acceptance The Soviets have resisted such exchanges in the past. `` It has been our agenda from the beginning to get the Soviets to talk to us in a direct way about our research activities and our testing activities and their research activities and testing activities,'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said. `` We are hopeful the Soviets will accept this invitation. ... It was made without conditions. We hope it will provide a basis then for discussions in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> that will lead them to accept an exchange in the future of such visits,'' he said. The invitation is intended to promote openness between the two nations by allowing the Soviets to learn more about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> research being conducted into the space-based anti-missile defense called the Strategic Defense Initiative, more commonly known as Star Wars. The U.S.-Soviet talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on slashing long-range nuclear weapons have been deadlocked over the Soviet demand that a treaty be contingent on completion of a separate agreement on space-based defenses. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> refusal to end its research into a Star Wars missile defense made an arms reduction accord improbable. Over the weekend in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, however, the Soviets said they would no longer insist that curbs on Star Wars be in place before a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty could be reached. The START talks are also going on in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, parallel to the space and defense talks. At the <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> session, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side invited a group of Soviet experts to visit the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s test facility in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Capistrano </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said the Soviets would be able to observe at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamos </LOCATION> the first particle beam device that was flown in space earlier this year and observe at the TRW facility the space-based laser project <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> stressed that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invitation is not contingent on a reciprocal invitation from the Soviets. He noted that the Soviets have complained about the two research sights, and the visits would provide the opportunity `` to gain more information about these activities adn build confidence by reducing the risk of technological surprises.'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said that the invitation was to be extended to Soviet experts working in the field, and that he expected five to 10 individuals would come if the offer is accepted. The ambassador said he was convinced the Soviets are moving ahead with their own research into space-based defensive system. `` I believe they are still working quite deliberately in this area,'' he said. `` If they know how to solve this problem techically, I have personally no doubt they will be moving to deploy ballistic missile defenses.''

 Citing a lack of evidence, a judge dropped charges against two reputed leaders of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel accused in the assassination of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s attorney general, a newspaper reported Tuesday. Elsewhere, hundreds of tourists boarded planes, buses and taxis out of the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION> after a bomb exploded at the Hilton Hotel there and killed two people. Later Tuesday, a bomb exploded in a crowded supermarket in a northern <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> suburb, injuring five people, police said. The bomb, tossed by an assailant who escaped in a car, damaged the front of the <ORGANIZATION> Carulla </ORGANIZATION> market, neighboring buildings and a car parked nearby, police said. In the five weeks since drug lords declared war on the government for trying to crack down on narcotics traffickers, there have been 111 bombings, most of them in this capital, <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION>. Eight people have been killed by those bombs, and 137 injured, according to police statistics. Also Tuesday, the M-19 leftist guerrilla group urged the government to pardon drug traffickers and stop extraditing them to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The statement appeared in a full page ad published in the country's biggest newspaper, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tiempo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiempo </PERSON> also reported that in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, a judge Monday dropped charges against <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, alleged leaders of the Medellin-based drug operation that supplies most of the cocaine in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The men are on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> list of 12 key drug figures wanted for prosecution in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The judge's action would not prevent their extraditions A prosecutor told the newspaper he would appeal federal judge <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>' decision. The Associated Press could not get through by telephone to the judge's office in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who have offered to negotiate with the government, had been charged with complicity in last year's kidnapping of <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastrana </PERSON>, who was a candidate for mayor of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> <PERSON> Pastrana </PERSON> was freed in an army raid and went on to be elected mayor of the capital. <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> were charged with planning the Jan. 25 assassination of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s attorney general, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyos </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION> bomb was one of the worst to have gone off in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s major cities since drug traffickers and the government went to war Aug. 18. No one claimed responsibility for the bomb, which went off Monday night. The explosion killed two doctors and wounded a third, said the chief of the national police in <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION>, Col. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>. Another bomb exploded in front of a <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION> bank Monday night, injuring one person, <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> said. An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> businessman with a store in <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> tourists were desperate to get out of the city. The few outbound flights were booked, and tourists were jamming the airport on a stand-by basis, he said by telephone, speaking on condition of anonymity. Tourists unable to find space on flights were snapping up tickets at bus stations and hiring taxis to take them to other cities, he said. <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION> has become popular with Canadian and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tourists and is a frequent stop for <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> cruise ships. The Hilton evacuated an estimated 1,500 guests to other hotels Monday night, according to the American. Colombian marines and army troops patrolled the city Tuesday, searching cars and frisking pedestrians. The guerrillas' ad published in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tiempo </LOCATION> proposed immediate negotiations between the government and drug traffickers. The proposal was not tied to the anticipated signing of a peace agreement between M-19 and President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s government. The treaty would pardon guerrillas and allow them to set up a political party, but it has been delayed in the last two days as the guerrillas and government negotiators continue to work out details. The guerrillas said in their ad that drug traffickers should be pardoned and the government should refused to extradite them to <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Colombian government and the army have long claimed that drug traffickers and many of the estimated 10,000 combatants in six guerrilla groups in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> are working together. The M-19 is the only guerrilla group negotiating with the government. M-19 took over <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> in 1985. The takeover and a cannon and machine gun assault by the army left 95 people dead. The group was formed in 1970 by dissidents who claimed a presidential election that year was fraudulent. Since then, it has used assassinations, kidnappings, plane hijackings and attacks on military bases and government installations in its attempt to topple the government.

 Israeli officials on Tuesday welcomed President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal to eliminate chemical weapons, but experts suggested the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> would pose a major problem area for putting the plan into effect. <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, a spokesman for Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> backed the call for wiping out stockpiles but declined to comment on the possibility of doing so within 10 years as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> supports very much the banning of all chemical weapons,'' he said. `` We have warned many times that <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> countries are arming themselves with such weapons and have in some cases used them against civilian populations.'' <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> noted <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> used chemical weapons during the 8-year <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> conflict and reports also surfaced of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> manufacturing them. A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s position is that we are totally against stocking or using chemical weapons and any action that leads to the suppression of chemical arms is welcomed and supported by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` We hope that there will be a worldwide movement so that all these weapons will be destroyed and never put to use again.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed Monday that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> would eliminate all of its chemical arms within 10 years if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other countries do the same. Israeli military analyst <PERSON> Aharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Levran </PERSON>, a retired army brigadier general, said <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> countries probably would balk at giving up chemical weapons that they saw as a counter to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s reported nuclear capability. He also suggested <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> countries may attach political conditions, such as <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> withdrawal from lands captured in war with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has never confirmed it, but foreign reports say <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has nuclear and chemical weapons as well as long-range missiles capable of delivering them. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is considering nationwide deployment of protective masks to counter the eventuality of chemical weapons. Civil defense authorities are conducting a yearlong trial in which 3,000 residents of two towns were given such masks. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers have been equipped with modern, protective masks and suits as well as detection and decontamination equipment. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is known to have chemical weapons, including mustard gas and the nerve agent <PERSON> Sarin </PERSON>. It used mustard gas against enemy soldiers while fighting <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and against civilians in <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION>, according to an assessment by <PERSON> Levran </PERSON> and members of an Israeli research group. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has extensive stockpiles of chemical weapons, including the nerve gas <LOCATION> Sarin </LOCATION>, the report said. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> also is believed to have poison gas. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> also has stockpiles of poison gas, according to the report by the <ORGANIZATION> Jaffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Levran </PERSON> said he doubted <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> would heed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call. `` The Iraqis are afraid that one day the Iranians will amass the forces and overrun them,'' he said.

 Leftist rebels attacked government forces in scattered raids in nine provinces Tuesday and military officials said 39 soldiers and guerrillas were killed. The rebels have agreed to peace talks and a communique said Tuesday's actions were in response to government repression. The communique, broadcast on the rebels' clandestine radio station, called the attacks a `` Halt the repression!'' offensive and said it was ordered because of the arrests of dozens of unionists. Military officials said guerrillas attacked targets in nine of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s 14 provinces. They listed the casualties as 26 guerrillas and 13 soldiers killed and 18 soldiers, 15 guerrillas and 6 civilians wounded. It was the broadest rebel offensive since May 10 when the guerrillas attacked positions in 10 provinces. And it was the first series of coordinated attacks by the guerrillas since government and rebel representatives held preliminary peace talks in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> City Sept. 13-15. An 11-day cease-fire declared unilaterally by the rebels ended Sunday. The rebel communique spoke of the `` fascist brutality'' of the rightist government of President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, referring to accusations by detainees that they were tortured and raped last week at National Police headquarters. It said in part, `` Just as we have been flexible and broadminded in order to negotiate, we are likewise completely disposed to, and capable of accompanying the struggle of the entire people.'' The document was signed by the five main rebel commanders, including <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Villalobos </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schafik </PERSON> <PERSON> Handal </PERSON> took part in the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> peace talks. Another round of negotiations is to take place in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> Oct. 16-17. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s government has denied the allegations of brutatlity and said it acted legitimately against the unionists because participants in their march last week burned two buses. All but 18 of the 71 unionists detained had been released by Tuesday. Those still in custody have been charged with terrorism, subversive activity and illegal association. The rebel communique also accused the government of taking advantage of the guerrilla cease-fire to move troops into rebel-controlled areas and to bombard civilian zones in the north and east. A 10-year-old civil war between the Marxist-led <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and a succession of U.S.-backed governments has taken an estimated 70,000 lives, with most of the victims civilians.

 A defense company, two former executives and a defense consultant pleaded guilty Tuesday to bribing a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> official in a scheme to get electronic contracts worth $ 7.7 million. <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON> Command and <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Whittaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, agreed to pay $ 3.5 million in fines and penalties for its part in the scheme to bribe <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> contracting official <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>. Guilty pleas were also entered by <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamberth </PERSON>, former president of the <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON> subsidiary, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Tassel </PERSON>, the operations director of its <LOCATION> Fayetteville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, facility and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> defense consultant <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Illeman </PERSON>. All three men agreed to cooperate with the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s continuing investigation dubbed `` Operation Ill Wind.'' A federal grand jury investigating the case, meanwhile, indicted defense consultant <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON> and another former <ORGANIZATION> Whittaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> executive, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON>, on charges of participating in the same bribery scheme. <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON>, targeted by investigators as an important figure in the case, and <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> were charged in the 16-count indictment with conspiracy, bribery and interstate travel in aid of racketeering. In its guilty plea, the company admitted funneling more than $ 80,000 to <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> between 1982 and 1988 through three defense consultants, including <PERSON> Illeman </PERSON>. The scandal stemmed from the awarding and expansion of contracts to provide electronic components for a battlefield air traffic control system. The guilty plea by <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON> Command and <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> is the third by a corporation in the continuing investigation of <LOCATION> Pentagaon </LOCATION> procurement fraud that has resulted in convictions of more than 20 officials, consultants and businessmen. <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hazeltine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> have both pleaded guilty for their roles in the procurement scandal. According to a company lawyer and court papers, <ORGANIZATION> Whittaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> officials were unaware of the bribery scheme, which began when the subsidiary was a private company called Lee Telecommunications. The bribery scheme was conceived in 1981 when <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Telecommunications </PERSON> started having financial troubles, according to court papers filed in the case in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Whittaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> acquired <ORGANIZATION> Lee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, later merging it with another subsidiary to form <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON> Command and <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lamberth </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> were stockholders of Lee Telecommunications and became, respectively, president and vice president of the <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON> subsidiary. <PERSON> Lamberth </PERSON>, 59, deliberately hid the bribery scheme from officials of the parent company after the acquisition, the court papers said. `` The board of directors and the present officers of the company do not have first-hand knowledge of he facts,'' <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON>'s attorney <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bookin </PERSON> told U.S. District Judge <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> `` No one who is involved in those activities is currently with the company,'' <PERSON> Bookin </PERSON> said, but the corporate officers `` see sufficient evidence to conclude that a guilty plea is appropriate.'' <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, who received an 18-month prison term for taking other bribes, helped Lee Telecommunications get a $ 600,000 contract in 1982 to build computers for the battlefield traffic-control system. He subsequently authorized several modifications that increased its value to more than $ 2.6 million, according to court papers. He also increased the value of another contract from $ 540,000 to $ 3.6 million by authorizing additional work. <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> later authorized the transfer of a $ 1.6 million worth of additional computer software work to Lee Telecommunications from a firm that could not perform its contract. <PERSON> Lamberth </PERSON> faces a possible 20-year sentence and fines up to $ 500,000 for his guilty pleas to conspiracy and bribery. <PERSON> Illeman </PERSON>, 64, and <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Tassel </PERSON>, 53, could each be sentenced up to 15 years and fined $ 250,000 for their pleas to bribery charges. Hilton scheduled sentencing for <PERSON> Lamberth </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Van </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tassel </ORGANIZATION> on Dec. 15 and for Illeman on Jan. 12. The indictment charged that the company paid more than $ 200,000 to <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Illeman </PERSON> and another defense consultant, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Marlowe </PERSON>, who is cooperating with the government, to share with <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> is accused in the indictment of submitting _ after the `` Ill Wind'' investigation became public _ a phony invoice to the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> to obtain reimbursement for $ 30,000 paid to <PERSON> Illeman </PERSON>, who told investigators he shared part of it with <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahern </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said his client refused a government offer to plead guilty, and will fight the charges in court. `` <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON> denies it all, denies there was any criminal intent on his part at any time,'' <PERSON> Ahern </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> Topel </PERSON>, vowed to fight the charges in court. `` I think this is a classic case of guilt by association,'' the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> lawyer said. `` I think the trial will show he had absolutely nothing to do with any of these wrongful activities, and at most was present at various times when they were discussed and did nothing further than that.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday barred a former justice from hearing cases in retirement after finding him guilty of misconduct while on the bench. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, 72, received the harshest possible penalty for seven violations of judicial canons, including his participation in cases involving a a friend, who was then an assistant judge. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> was the first justice of the <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to be found guilty of judicial misconduct. Special prosecutor <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said he sought the reprimand and suspension to assure judges are held to the highest standards.

He was first appointed in 1976. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> has repeatedly refused to comment on the allegations. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Marks </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s lawyer, urged justices not to suspend him, saying that his reputation has suffered irreparable harm. `` At most, Justice <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> was guilty of misjudgments,'' said Marks. `` After 28 years in service to this court and to the judiciary, this is the blemish of his record, the blemish on which some people may remember him.'' <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> was found guilty last week of ethics violations. He was also found guilty of intimidating state Attorney General <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Amestoy </PERSON> by personally delivering a letter to him urging a criminal investigation of <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheel </PERSON> be speeded up.

 RHEIN-MAIN AIR BASE, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Veterans of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> airlift on Tuesday commemorated the crews who daily flew tons of supplies to break a Soviet blockade of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s former capital that ended 40 years ago. Among the 350 people attending the ceremony were former <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> teams who risked their lives ferrying food to West Berliners during the 462-day Soviet blockade that began on June 26, 1948. At least 79 aviation crewmembers lost their lives during the dramatic airlift that ended on Sept. 30, 1949, after 2.3 million tons of food and life-sustaining equipment were dropped into the city surrounded by what is now <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to keep 2 -LCB- million West Berliners nourished and warm. `` It would take about 20 hours to fly here in a C54,'' recalled former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pilot A.L. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. `` We'd land in <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Azores </LOCATION>, then on to <LOCATION> Rhein-Main </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- to get here.'' Jets now make the flight in one-third that time. `` No other event shows the turning point of German-American relations as impressively as the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Airlift,'' said <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Knittel </PERSON>, deputy West German transportation minister, at the memorial ceremony. `` With the aid of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and through the strong will of the Berliners to remain free, the city became a symbol of freedom in the world,'' <PERSON> Knittel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomlinson </PERSON>, a 92-year-old former <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> captain, laid a wreath at the foot of <LOCATION> Rhein-Main </LOCATION>'s airlift memorial, a large cement monument pointed in the direction of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tomlinson </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Silverton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, is the oldest surviving <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> airlift pilot, and was in charge of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> squadrons VR6 and VR8 based at <LOCATION> Rhein-Main </LOCATION> during the airlift. Some pilots rose to fame during the dramatic 15-month airlift, like retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Halvorsen </PERSON>, known as the `` Candy Bomber'' for his idea of dropping raisins and sweets to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> children. But the airlift was a success because of the involvement of thousands behind the scenes. `` I was a store keeper in charge of ordering parts to repair and help keep those airplanes flying,'' said 68-year-old <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cupertino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, as he watched the ceremony. `` We worked a lot of long, hard hours doing it.'' The reunion of former airlift crews was organized by the Airlift Associations in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>FAA Giving Airlines More Time To Develop Drug Programs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is extending its deadline for air carriers to submit plans for anti-drug programs, including random testing of employees, officials said Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said 22 of 130 carriers using planes capable of carrying more than 30 passengers have failed to submit their plans, orginally due Aug. 18. A federally mandated anti-drug program for the aviation industry takes effect Dec. 18. The new deadline for submitting proposals is Oct. 9, <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said. He said just over 100 companies using smaller planes have submitted proposals for implementing the program, which requires employment, post-accident and random drug testing. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials said it is difficult to tell how many of the estimated 3,000 smaller aviation companies might be covered by the law, since it covers only those with more than 50 employees. The agency has sent letters to hundreds of companies warning them that it will take legal action if they fail to meet the Oct. 9 deadline. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> recognizes that since this is a new requirement and involves comprehensive planning and implementation, the airline industry has faced numerous difficult tasks in developing anti-drug plans,'' the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> letters say. Airlines that fail to comply face penalties of up to $ 10,000 for each day their plan has not been submitted. <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said no fines will be assessed until after the new deadline. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has 60 days to approve each company's plan.

The outnumbered <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, who is closely allied with environmental organizations, accepted defeat without a roll call, saying he wanted to avoid forcing members to take a public position against stringent automobile controls. <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, promising to return with a compromise that still would toughen <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s auto requirments, said, `` Sometimes you do n't want them on record so they can re-think their position and come around.'' Rep. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lent </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the parent committee and the main GOP sponsor of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> legislation, said <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>'s proposals would have cost consumers an extra $ 500 per car if fully implemented for model year 2000. For that expense, he said pollution under <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>'s plan would only be cut an additional 2.7 percent compared with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> legislation. Estimates of the cost of current auto emissions contols have clustered around $ 1,500 per car in recent years. Lent said the technology does n't exist to meet the <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> standards, which he said represented `` the dreams of the authors and have no basis in technological fact.'' Whatever happens in the subcommittee, the battle over auto standards is expected to surface again in the full <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has not yet begun work on clean air legislation. Motor vehicles are a major contributor to ozone pollution, in some areas the principal contributor, through the emission of unburned fuel vapors. They also emit oxides of nitrogen and carbon monoxide Ozone, the prime ingredient of smog, is produced by the reaction of hydrocarbons _ unburned fuel _ and nitrogen oxides in the presence of sunlight and heat. Because of its ozone problems, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has tougher auto pollution standards than the rest of the nation. <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>'s plan would have limited hydrocarbon emissions to 0.25 grams per mile _ the standard for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> starting in 1995 _ from 1993 through 1999, and 0.125 grams per mile after that. Outside <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, cars are limited to 0.41 grams per mile under current law. Nitrogen oxides, which also contribute to acid rain, would have been capped at 0.4 grams per mile from 1993 through 1999, down from 1 gram now, and 0.2 grams after 1999. <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>'s proposed limit for carbon monoxide was 3.4 grams per mile from 1992 through 1999, the current standard, and 1.7 grams afterwards. The administration's proposed standard for hydrocarbons is 0.25 grams per mile by 1998; for nitrogen oxides, 0.7 grams by the same year; and for carbon monoxide, retention of the current 3.4 gram limit. Rep. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Walgren </PERSON>, D-Pa., who supported <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, said, `` We are really in the dark Our eyes glaze over at these numbers.''

<HEAD>Only 130 of 1,200 Accept East Berlin Offer, Leave Embassy in Prague</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 About 130 East German refugees out of about 1,200 camped out in the West German Embassy garden left the compound Tuesday to accept an offer of guaranteed emigration within six months of returning home. But refugees estimated that about 120 newcomers scaled the embassy fence Tuesday. New refugees arrived while people boarded buses to leave at the other end of the compound. East German emissary <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> said those willing to return could emigrate without facing prosecution for `` flight from the republic'' and other offenses. The 130 or so refugees left the embassy in two buses and private cars, and spokesmen said an additional 100 intend to follow them Wednesday. The flow of East German refugees into <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> also increased Tuesday, with some camping out on streets near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, uncertain where they would spend the night. The number of refugees appeared to have risen to more than 400 people. Newcomers registered with West German officials at a kiosk near the embassy staffed by a member of the diplomatic staff. On the Austrian border with <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, authorities said Tuesday that the number of East Germans crossing into <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> since <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> opened its borders for them stood at 21,424 Tuesday morning, about 950 more than the day before. From <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, the East Germans rapidly proceed to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which offers them immediate citizenship. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> is between <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Refugees said East German emissaries in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> would hold two sessions Wednesday to submit their offer for more people to vacate the West German mission and go home. All East German citizens who announce themselves ready to leave the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> receive a piece of paper to serve as a document for them to cross the East German border without trouble at two checkpoints. Spokesmen for the refugees who took part in the negotiations said <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> issued a written guarantee which was handed over to West German government officials taking part in the talks. The guarantee reportedly stipulates the right to emigrate within six months after returning to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Even while <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> conferred with the refugees, newcomers arrived, most of them families with children. The embassy in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, crowded with refugees, was closed last week to prevent more people from entering. At least some of the newly arrived East Germans were told to fend for themselves Monday evening in finding a place to sleep. Part of the overflow was absorbed by a former seminary at <LOCATION> Tarchomin </LOCATION>, just outside <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, lent by <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> officials to the West German authorities. There the number of East German inhabitants was up to 152 on Tuesday, compared to just 16 a week ago, according to occupants. The back of the seminary looked like a parking lot in <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>, with more than 20 vehicles, mostly East German-made Wartburgs and Trabants. The streets around the embassy in the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> residential district of <PERSON> Saska </PERSON> <PERSON> Kepa </PERSON> also contained East German cars, some with license plates removed as a symbol that their owners did not plan to return to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

 Federal investigators looking into the crash of a <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> jet said Tuesday that almost all the tread on the front tires was gone, but there was no indication the wheels had jammed. The finding about the front wheels would be consistent with the pilot's statements that he had tried o bring the jet to a halt before it skidded off the runway into the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> on Sept. 20, said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. Two people were killed and 59 others were rescued from the water after the pilot aborted takeoff of Flight 5050 at <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Although 95 percent of the tread on the front tires was gone, the main landing gear under the wings looked normal, <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON> said. The wing flaps were all in normal takeoff position. Investigators reported earlier that the front wheels were locked sharply to the right, indicating that the pilot had turned the tiller to counteract a drift to the left. Capt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> told investigators that he aborted the takeoff because the aircraft was moving left and he felt and heard a strange vibration. Investigators planned to look inside the engines of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-400 for additional clues to the cause of the crash. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Santucci </PERSON>, district attorney for the borough of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, who has launched a grand jury investigation of the pilots' conduct, said Monday that urine samples taken two days after the accident contained no sign of drug or alcohol use by the pilot or copilot of Flight 5050. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and his copilot, <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleissas </PERSON>, were criticized by federal officials for failing to submit to testing immediately after the crash, although they are not legally required to do so. Medical experts said alcohol would usually not show up in urine samples taken two days after ingestion, although drugs such as marijuana or cocaine probably would.

<HEAD>Transportation Employees Test 99 Percent Drug Free</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Less than 1 percent of the 15,352 random drug tests conducted on <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employees have turned up drug use, according to a department report released Tuesday. Of the 15,352 tests conducted Jan. 1, 1988 through April 30, 1989, there were 99 positives for drug use, according to the `` Drug-Free Workplace Program Evaluation Report'' for September 1989, announced by <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` Marijuana use accounted for approximately two-thirds of positives with cocaine accounting for all but a small percentage of the rest,'' the report says. The total cost for the department's drug program in fiscal 1988, which ended last Sept. 30, was over $ 4 million, covering collection, laboratory testing, staff support and informational services, according to the report. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> employees accounted for 95 percent of those tested under the random testing program which focuses on safety and security personnel whose actions have a direct and immediate impact on the public health and safety, the protection of life and property, law enforcement or national security. Of these so-called Category 1 employees, 65 percent are air traffic controllers, 16 percent are electronic technicians, 4 percent are air traffic assistants, 3 percent are aviation safety inspectors, and 12 percent hold other jobs. A total of 92 percent of supervisors and 72 percent of the employees tested who were surveyed later by the department said their individual privacy was protected during the specimen collection process. However, comments on the questionnaire `` also spoke to isolated instances where -LRB- specimen -RRB- collectors acted in an unprofessional manner and employees felt the collection process was conducted in a ` degrading' manner,'' the report says, noting that <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> employees who have been subjected to drug tests also have criticized contractors conducting the tests. In addition to the widespread random testing, the department also conducted reasonable suspicion testing, post-accident testing and follow-up testing. There were only 17 reasonable suspicion tests department-wide from Jan. 1, 1988 through April 30, 1989, and they resulted in eight verified positives for drug use, according to the report. At the same time, there were 26 post-accident drug tests in the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and two in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, and all were negative. In follow-up testing, 105 employees who had been identified as using an illegal substance were subjected to a total of 659 follow-ups, and these tests found 26 verified positives, or approximately 25 percent of the employees, the report says. Regarding the random testing, the report concludes that random selection of employees has been accomplished, but `` many employees do not appear to fully understand the random selection process and therefore are skeptical of its validity. ... There seems to be an impression that selection of specific individuals drives the random selection process,'' The report says the process selects facilities on a random basis with names of employees also listed in random order, and that the <ORGANIZATION> Departmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> was developing an informational videotape to outline the process for employees. Drug program personnel, meanwhile, are questioning whether the department could achieve the same level of deterrence with less than a 50 percent annual random sample, and the report calls for the drug office to assess what level of random testing would be best.

 A noisy high school gymnasium is serving as a shelter for a stream of refugees who fled hurricane-battered <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> with little money or clothes and tales of destruction. More than 500 people have used the shelter since it was set up Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Homestead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. On Tuesday, 129 people remained, eating free food and resting on cots while relief workers tried to contact friends or relatives willing to take them in. `` We lost our house and we had nowhere to stay down there, and with all the looting we had no money,'' said <PERSON> Ansylma </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, 16, who arrived with her mother and four younger siblings. `` We're looking for a house -LRB- in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> -RRB-. That's the main thing,'' she said, keeping an eye on the children and a few possessions stacked near their assigned cots. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has flown more than 1,000 people from the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> islands to <ORGANIZATION> Homestead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> south of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> since Hurricane Hugo struck Sept. 17. Other planes brought survivors to <ORGANIZATION> MacDill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>. Some children arrived alone, <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> officials said. `` We're trying to work with state officials to help the handful of kids who have arrived unaccompanied,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Donia </PERSON>, a spokesman in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> for the relief agency. `` We would pay for transporting them to friends or relatives.'' When <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> slammed into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, it destroyed or damaged 97 percent of the homes on St. Croix before heading to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mainland. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> volunteers said most refugees want to return to <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Croix </PERSON>, but several refugees said Tuesday the island had little to offer them after being ravaged by the hurricane and the widespread looting that followed. `` It looked like an A-bomb went off,'' said <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, 38, a lawyer staying at the MacDill shelter who said looters took advantage of the chaos. `` It was outrageous ... everything was out of hand.'' While children played tag or slept, parents told of plans to rebuild their lives from scratch. `` I lose everything, my new refrigerator, my sofa, everything gone,'' said <PERSON> Olga </PERSON> <PERSON> Melendez </PERSON>, 19, who watched her 2-year-old son while her husband tried to reach an uncle in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>. `` Even my wedding ring.

 Sand and signs sailed out with Hurricane Hugo, but this resort city's brassy trademarks of goofy golf and bright lights will shine ever brighter next year, merchants vowed. `` Come spring, I think it will be just like it's been for 30 years,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, as he and co-owner <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> cleaned up <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gold </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Outlet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> on </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION>. `` There'll be flashing lights and cars cruising with good-looking girls looking for good-looking guys. It's not going to change one bit,'' he said. Tourists converge on the <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> area's 59 golf courses and 60 miles of beaches during the summer season, swelling the population from 28,000 to as much as 300,000. But it's the city's dinosaur-inhabited miniature golf courses and bright light boulevards that most people remember about <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. `` We're tacky. But we're so tacky that people love us,'' boasted <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldorf </PERSON>, owner of the Fun Plaza arcade, restaurant and gift shop. `` Nothing has changed. The show goes on.'' Hurricane Hugo sent its worst fury farther south, but it still swept to sea the city's $ 4.5 million renourishment project that saw 50,000 dump truck loads of sand spread around the central beach area two years ago. `` We feel -LRB- the project -RRB- saved us,'' city spokesman <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowling </PERSON> said. `` Without it, we would have been in much worse shape.'' As it is, the central oceanfront promenade is now a mess of slanting slabs of concrete. All 110 wooden walkways that provide public access to the beach were wiped out. Some stores facing the open were battered into empty shells by the surging ocean. At least 15 hotels and homes were severely damaged, while all other beachfront property sustained varying degrees of damage. But the city's landmarks remain, including the Pavilion arcade and Gay Dolphin gift shop, which carries such specialties as miniature roadsters, turkeys and landscapes made from sea shells. And, on Monday, several hotels and motels reopened. But the beach remained off-limits because of contamination from backed up sewers. A 7 p.m. curfew remained in effect. The Swamp Fox roller coaster still rises from a storm-battered amusement park, and a plastic zebra and her two young remain near an artificial cave at the Jungle Lagoon miniature golf course up the road. `` It's still <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dowling </PERSON> said. `` We think that's good in terms of the variety it implies. Still, he acknowledges some people might say: `` Ah, damn it, that stuff is n't gone yet.''

 <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> is n't the only writer living in an Islamic community who faces threats, intimidation and de facto censorship, the <ORGANIZATION> PEN </ORGANIZATION> international writers association said Tuesday. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Blokh </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> PEN </ORGANIZATION>'s international secretary, said a writer with an Islamic background `` can be in a very free city ... and yet he lives in a very permanent state of terror, discreet terror.'' The association, holding its world congress in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, recommended its member chapters invite writers from the Islamic community to discuss such situations, their causes and the means to find a solution. `` We would ask them to come and very discreetly tell us their story if they want to,'' <PERSON> Blokh </PERSON> said at a news conference. <PERSON> Blokh </PERSON> said PEN learned about such cases in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> as it prepared protests of the death sentence by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> over the bestselling novel `` The Satanic Verses,'' which sent <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> into hiding. The late <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Rushie </PERSON>'s death in February, saying Islam was slandered by the book. He said he also knew of one similar case of pressuring a writer in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` I'm not going to tell you any concrete cases because they are still quite secret,'' <PERSON> Blokh </PERSON> said. He said only the <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> case was known to have `` official status,'' issued by a government, but other incidents of `` religious fanaticism'' could be considered a new threat to freedom of expression that had not been anticipated at the end of the 20th century. The known cases consist of `` pressures, intimidation, sometimes direct threats'' against Islamic writers in English and French, <PERSON> Blokh </PERSON> said. He said the new form of censorship discovered only recently was `` something for which we're not prepared.'' The threats were coming not from a government but from a `` very hard to define'' community, he said. The recommendation on intolerance and fanaticism, as translated by The AP from a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> copy, said the <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> incident `` is not isolated and revealed many other pressures, happily less grave'' on writers that may stem from diplomatic, family, community, religious or terrorist sources. The PEN conference moves Wednesday to <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> before concluding Friday. It is the association's first meeting in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> since a heavily publicized 1986 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> event. PEN, founded in 1921, has 11,000 members in more than 60 chapters organized along language lines. It is an international association of poets, playrights, editors, essayists and novelists.

 The killers of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug agent <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> each will be sentenced to an average of 150 years in prison in the next two months, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s attorney general said Tuesday. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> conceded that numerous judicial delays had occurred since <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> and 28 others were convicted in the <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> case, but said sentencing now was expected in November. `` We Mexicans are convinced drug trafficking can only be beaten through effective and energetic international action,'' he said in a statement one week before President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>'s first official visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> With drug trafficking a major item on the U.S.-Mexico agenda, <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> outlined <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s progress 10 months into <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' term. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> is due to meet President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and speak before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> said more than 8,000 people have been arrested on drug charges, almost 22 tons of cocaine base have been seized, enforcement and training has been toughened, and laws have been changed to increase prison time for narcotics violators and corrupt officials. He said funds to investigate and prevent drug-related offenses were increased 133 percent, to more than $ 50 million. He noted that 15 Mexican drug enforcement agents were killed on duty in the last 10 months. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have praised the <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> administration's efforts One official called last April's arrest of <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON>, named as a drug kingpin, nothing less than a `` miracle.'' The 1985 killing of <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent who was working in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION>, has been a sensitive issue. <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> defended the <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> prosecution, saying it was a complex case that involved numerous drug traffickers. In answer to questions, he said sentences would `` average'' 150 years in prison but gave no details. <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> and his Mexican pilot were kidnapped on Feb. 7, 1985. Their bodies, bearing signs of torture, were found a month later on a ranch 60 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> was working more closely than ever with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on such issues as tracing laundered drug money and drug lords' assets. However, he said allowing `` hot pursuit'' of suspected drug traffickers' airplanes across the border was a `` stupid discussion'' _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would not permit such a violation of sovereignty and neither would <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> said <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> ordered him to make a public report on the administration's anti-drug efforts. He denied that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> was putting on a `` show'' in advance of the meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` This is not a ` show' nor is there anything in the slightest theatrical about this,'' said <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, who was sitting on a podium surrounded by 6.3 tons of cocaine in thousands of white and brown packages. The cocaine had been seized in the last two months, <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> said, most of it along the U.S.-Mexico border. <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> said he did not know if increased enforcement efforts had reduced the flow of drugs to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We only know how much we seize,'' <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> said. `` We do n't really know how much gets through. Drug use in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is still very low compared to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> said, but prevention and rehabilitation programs are also being reinforced. <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> said it will be two or three months before the effect of the crackdown on drug cartels by <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> in the last month can be known. He said there had not yet been any visible effect on the amount of drugs in the pipeline.

He watched from behind a grill as Judge <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasco </PERSON>'s sentence of two years and a 2,000-peso -LRB- 80 cent -RRB- fine on each of three counts was read `` I do n't agree with this sentence,'' <PERSON> Durazo </PERSON> told reporters. He said he will appeal. <PERSON> Durazo </PERSON> was charged with illegally possessing 52 pistols but said as police chief he had a right to keep weapons and some of the weapons were replicas. <PERSON> Durazo </PERSON> was a childhood friend of <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Portillo </PERSON>'s and became one of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s most powerful men when <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Portillo </PERSON> became president. He built mansions, one with a race track, and had 1,200 personal employees. Some servants wore gold-trimmed uniforms. All were on the police payroll. Among other charges, police officers allegedly had to pay <PERSON> Durazo </PERSON> fees every two weeks to keep their jobs. He is now held up by members of President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>'s administration as a prime example of the bad old days of corruption in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. All his houses, including those outside <LOCATION> Ixtapa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, have been expropriated.

<HEAD>Shamir Says Acceptance of Egyptian Plan Equals Surrender</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LOUIS MEIXLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said Tuesday that acceptance of the Egyptian peace plan would be tantamount to a surrender to the Arab uprising. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, in a speech in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said, `` There is no reason for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to surrender and accept the intefadeh -LRB- uprising -RRB- as victorious and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as landlord over part of the land of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` What has been proposed to us today is to go to <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> to talk to the intefadeh leaders and the heads of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> about the shortest path toward a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> added. It was one of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s harshest criticisms of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s 10-point peace plan, which has caused tension in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s coalition Cabinet between <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc and the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> after <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> accepted it in principle. Labor head and Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said Tuesday his party `` thinks we now have a most important chance for advancing the peace process. ... We should not miss this opportunity just because some people think party considerations prevail over those of state.'' Meanwhile, <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Olmert </PERSON>, the Cabinet minister responsible for Arab affairs, said Tuesday that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should consider imposing the death penalty for security offenses in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Olmert </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> that he believed the Palestinian uprising was continuing because `` the punishments applied until now are not deterrent enough ... and therefore maybe we should consider perhaps somewhat harsher punishment.'' Asked what he would recommend, he said, `` Capital punishment.'' <PERSON> Olmert </PERSON> also described Israeli prisons as `` too comfortable'' and said `` hard labor might be one of the harsher conditions that should be considered.'' Also Tuesday, the body of a 30-year-old Palestinian was found in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> a day after he was kidnapped by masked <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> youths, Palestinian reporters said. They said <PERSON> Hani </PERSON> <PERSON> Emil </PERSON> <PERSON> Salfiti </PERSON>, an ambulance driver, was apparently strangled after being accused of being an informer for the Shin Bet secret service, reporters said. The army confirmed the death and said it was investigating. <PERSON> Salfiti </PERSON>'s death raised to 121 the number of Palestinians killed by fellow <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> as alleged collaborators with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> since the start of the 21-month-old uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and civilians have killed 574 Palestinians in the revolt, and 40 Israelis have died in the violence. Meanwhile, four Arabs were reported shot and wounded Tuesday in stone-throwing clashes with troops in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> hospitals reported. The army had no immediate reports of casualties in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. A district court in the southern town of <LOCATION> Beersheva </LOCATION> on Tuesday sentenced <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Efrakh </PERSON>, a Jewish settler from <PERSON> Neve </PERSON> <PERSON> Dekalim </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, to seven months in suspended sentence for shooting to death an Arab girl. <PERSON> Intissar </PERSON> <PERSON> Atar </PERSON>, 17, was killed on Nov. 10, 1987 by an accidental shot from <PERSON> Efrakh </PERSON>'s pistol fired after <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> girls in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> stoned a car in which Efrakh and other settlers traveled, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. The verdict pointed out that <PERSON> Efrakh </PERSON> had no intention of causing death and that `` regular criminal punishment considerations could not apply in this case.'' The court also sentenced 22-year-old Ezad <PERSON> Mahmud </PERSON> <PERSON> Shabban </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> to life in prison Tuesday for the Aug. 4 slayings of two fellow Palestinian prisoners for allegedly collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The Egyptian initiative advocates trading occupied territory for peace and calls for preliminary Israeli-Palestinian talks in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation would include two Arabs deported by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to represent Palestinians in the diaspora. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has welcomed <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s initiative, designed to sidestep <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> objections to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> participation in the talks. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> considers the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to be a terrorist organization. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has rejected any modification of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s own initiative, which calls for Palestinian elections to select representatives for talks on limited autonomy. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s aide <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> denied that <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s rejection of the proposed <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> meeting contradicted earlier statements that he was willing to meet with Palestinians to arrange elections. `` The prime minister has no problem meeting Palestinians,'' <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said. `` The issue is that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s initiative wants us to meet with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> people.'' The Polish-born <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, whose family died in the Holocaust, compared suggestions that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> talk with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s attempted appeasement of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in the 1930s `` They made great efforts to prevent a war with <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> leadership,'' said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. `` But the results were far worse then the First World War. It seems that to us the lesson is clear.''

<HEAD>Wally Floody, Who Engineered Tunnel for `Great Escape,' Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Floody </PERSON>, whose tunneling expertise enabled 76 fellow Allied officers to break out of an `` escape-proof'' <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> POW </ORGANIZATION> camp _ portrayed in the film `` The Great Escape'' _ has died after a lengthy illness. He was 71. Floody, a World War II Spitfire fighter pilot, died in a hospital Monday. His son <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> reported, `` He had chronic lung disease, partially due to the tunneling he did during the war. It only got severe during the past several years.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officer, <PERSON> Floody </PERSON> was 23 when his plane was shot down over <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1941. He used his mining experience from <LOCATION> Kirkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, Ont., to engineer and dig the 350-foot tunnel out of <PERSON> Stalag </PERSON> <PERSON> Luft </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> Floody designed the lighting, ventilation and electrical systems. It took at least 400 prisoners to dig the tunnels. The camp, then holding about 1,500 captured officers, was supposed to be escape-proof, but 126 prisoners broke out on March 24, 1944, and 76 escaped. <PERSON> Floody </PERSON> said the 50 who were recaptured were shot. Floody himself was not among those who made it to freedom. He was transferred from the camp two weeks before the breakout. Of the 76 officers who fled the camp, only three eventually made good their escape. <PERSON> Floody </PERSON> remarked in a 1986 interview, `` Every time I tell my wife I might have been one of the prisoners who got away, she reminds me: ` Yes, but you might have been one of the ones they shot.''' He served as a technical adviser for the 1963 movie `` The Great Escape,'' starring <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> McQueen </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON>. His son <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> said the presentation of his father in the film `` was sort of a composite role.'' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> noted that some people said that since the tunnel king was played by <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON>, that must have been based on his father. `` Dad never said it specifically,'' he said. <PERSON> Floody </PERSON> often served as lead digger and passed buckets of gravel back to the men working in the tunnels, which were named <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>. The dirt was dumped surreptitiously into the camp's gardens. On several occasions, <PERSON> Floody </PERSON> was trapped in cave-ins and was pulled out by his heels. The Germans found <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> was abandoned. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> became the escape route. <PERSON> Floody </PERSON> was a prisoner until the war ended. He returned to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and began a business career in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. Besides <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>, he leaves his wife, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, and another son, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Quebec Voters Show Support Still Lingers for Separatism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> must grapple again with tensions between its English - and French-speaking populations after <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>'s provincial election showed continued support for the separatist <LOCATION> Parti </LOCATION> There also was a surprising vote in Monday's election for a new <ORGANIZATION> Equality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> formed by English-speaking Canadians irate over <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>'s language policies that favor French. Although Quebec Premier <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON> led his <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to almost as large a majority as it won four years ago, it lost some support to the revitalized <LOCATION> Parti </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quebecois </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Equality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The provincial assembly will have 92 <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> deputies, 29 from the <LOCATION> Parti </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quebecois </LOCATION> and four from Equality. In the December 1985 election, the Liberals ousted the <LOCATION> Parti </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quebecois </LOCATION>, which had been in power for nine years, and won 99 of the then-122 seats in the assembly. `` They said the idea -LRB- of an independent, French-speaking Quebec -RRB- was dead; it is alive,'' a jubilant <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Parizeau </PERSON> said Monday night. He led an internal <LOCATION> Parti </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quebecois </LOCATION> struggle last year that placed it back on a policy of eventual independence. Just months ago it appeared the <LOCATION> Parti </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quebecois </LOCATION> faced extinction but under <PERSON> Parizeau </PERSON> it won 40 percent of the popular vote Monday. The percentage was a slight increase from 1985 and was similar to the vote in a 1980 referendum when the province's electorate defeated the Parti Quebecois' policy of separatism. <PERSON> Parizeau </PERSON> won a seat in the <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> assembly and is expected to be a strong leader of the separatists. He calls for control to be gradually taken away from the federal government over <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>'s family, language, cultural, social and development policies with a provincial referendum to be held on each issue. A constitution then would be drafted for <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> and it would be submitted to a vote. <PERSON> Parizeau </PERSON> has offered no timetable for his plan. Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> and leader of the Progressive Conservatives, told reporters in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> Tuesday that the <LOCATION> Parti </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quebecois </LOCATION> has had steady support since the 1970s and Monday's balloting did n't change that. He was asked if he was concerned and replied, `` The answer of course is no, not at all.'' The Progressive Conservatives and Liberals are <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s largest political parties. About 81 percent of <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>'s 6.5 million people speak French while English is the dominant language in the country's nine other provinces. <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON> said the election Monday was a `` truly decisive victory'' for the Liberals and `` confirms the confidence of the majority of Quebecers in the federal regime.'' But the wins by the <ORGANIZATION> Equality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will make it more difficult for <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON> to maneuver between the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> - and English-speaking sentiments in the province Quebec's Liberals traditionally count on support from the English-speaking minority and the <ORGANIZATION> Equality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> drew from that source. In December, <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON> refused to allow more than a token change in provincial laws restricting commercial signs to the French language. His compromise allowed bilingual signs only indoors with the French-language portion significantly larger than the English. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Libman </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Equality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was happy with Monday's results and in a speech delivered in English and French he said: `` A significant segment of <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>'s population who share a vision of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> now have the political representation that they need. The English and French must speak to one another.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed two long-delayed spending bills Tuesday as a 13-day partisan standoff began to ease, while the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> braced for a looming budget mess by approving legislation to keep the government in business next month. On an 89-11 tally, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved a $ 14.4 billion foreign aid measure for next year that would provide $ 45 million in assistance to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s new non-communist government. It then voted 81-19 for a $ 157.4 billion bill for labor, health and education programs containing slightly liberalized abortion rules. Across the Capitol, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 274-152 to send the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> a bill pumping enough money to federal agencies to let them function through Oct. 25. The vote came just five days before the start of the new fiscal year. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> had completed debate on the two spending bills last week. But votes on final approval were delayed while Democrats and Republicans held private talks on rival proposals to beef up the government's efforts against illegal drugs. Those negotiations neared completion Tuesday. The assistance to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> provided by the foreign aid measure far exceeded the $ 10 million President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed making available. The measure would also boost <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> by $ 5 million to $ 90 million. Under the eased abortion rules, women who are pregnant because of rape or incest would qualify for federal aid to pay for abortions, expanding the current criteria by which such assistance is paid only when a mother's life is in danger. The bill would also withhold some federal aid from states that do not require the notification of people whose spouses have AIDS. Both bills ca n't be sent to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his signature until the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> work out resolve their different verswions of each. Final action on an $ 11.9 billion transportation bill was withheld as party leaders work out final details of an anti-drug package. Passage of a $ 67.2 billion measure for veterans, housing and space programs was also postponed while lawmakers considered bolstering it with aid for communities hit by Hurricane Hugo last week. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has sent President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> just one of the 13 annual spending bills for the new fiscal year, even though they are supposed to be completed by Oct. 1, the start of fiscal 1990. The rest of the measures have been slowed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' earlier distraction with the problems of former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, its work on an emergency spending bill for this year and the question of how much money the government should spend battling the drug problem. Missing deadlines for approval of spending bills is nothing new for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. When lawmakers finished all 13 of the measures for 1989 one minute before midnight last Sept. 30, it was the first time they had done so in 12 years. Because of that, during Tuesday's brief <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> debate on the temporary spending bill, the ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Conte </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, suggested a new version of `` <LOCATION> Auld </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Syne </LOCATION>'' for the new federal fiscal year. `` Should all deadlines be forgot and never met on time,'' <PERSON> Conte </PERSON> told his colleagues. The temporary spending measure has the support of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. Lawmakers hope that by the time it expires, they will have completed work on the remaining 12 spending measures. Here are the negative votes in the 89-11 passage of the foreign aid bill: <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Colo </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill.; <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Earnest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollings </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>: <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>; <PERSON> William </PERSON>; <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>, R-Idaho and <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>. Here are the negative votes in the 81-19 passage of the labor, health and education bill: <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>; <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON>, R-Minn.; <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, D-N.D.; <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>; <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, R-Minn.; <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>; <PERSON> Slade </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorton </PERSON>, R-Wash.; <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, D-Ala.; <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>; <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>; <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>; <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Okla </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>; <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>; Wallop and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>,

 Most automotive speed machines come in colors other than passionate pink, but no one laughs when <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> arrives in his magenta <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valiant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Duster </ORGANIZATION>. The 1970 Chrysler product, with a rare model of engine, may be worth several times its price paid back in those days when a car could be had for under $ 3,000. `` The paint name is magenta, nicknamed panther pink,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Friar </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, who helped <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> restore the original sheen. `` We had to call -LRB- the manufacturer -RRB- and get the formula. They only painted 12 originally, and being the kind of car it is, it's extremely rare. The number of these classic pink muscle cars yet remaining could probably be counted on one hand. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> says his, which has just 40,000 miles on it, may be the only one that's been completely restored. `` A friend of mine -LRB- who -RRB- deals in high-performance cars said that it's worth at least $ 15,000 to $ 20,000, and said if it's the only one, you could probably name your price,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. Not that it's for sale, said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, who has worked for <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> for 23 years. `` I'm probably going to hang onto it,'' he said. `` I'd hate to get rid of something and not know what it's worth.''

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police reported at least 40 people were killed Tuesday in ethnic violence a day before a cease-fire declared by the government in its battle with Sinhalese militants. The predominantly Sinhalese government declared a unilateral cease-fire beginning Wednesday in central and southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> but there has been no response from the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. The front was formed by militant Sinhalese who accuse the government of granting too many concessions to the Tamil minority. Police and military officials said most of the 40 people killed Tuesday were members or supporters of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. They said the bodies of 17 Sihnhalese militants were found in two villages in <LOCATION> Kandy </LOCATION>, a district 55 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, and 13 bodies of Sinhalese were reported in several southern hamlets. The <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> reported security forces killed six Sinhalese radicals in two incidents and blamed Sinhalese militants in the deaths of four civilians. It also said 297 suspected extremists had been arrested. Military helicopters on Tuesday dropped 200,000 Sinhalese-language leaflets, in areas where the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> has been active, urging the militants to surrender. `` Take advantage of this opportunity and give yourself up,'' said the leaflets. `` You will be warmly received and will be fully protected.'' Most of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s Tamils live in northern and eastern zones of the island and Tamil separatists began fighting six years ago for their own homeland. The Sinhalese militants opened their revolt against the government two years ago, accusing it of bowing to Tamil demands. Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, form 18 percent of the country's 16 million people and the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION> 75 percent. More than 5,000 people, most of them government officials and security personnel, have been killed in the Sinhalese uprising. At least 11,000 people have been killed in violence related to the Tamil insurgency.

<TEXT>
 Gang-related fighting broke out among more than 300 prison inmates Tuesday, and guards fired shots to break it up, officials said. One inmate was killed and four others were wounded. Altogether, more than 20 people were injured in the disturbance at the maximum-security <ORGANIZATION> Menard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, including two guards, prison authorities said. The disturbance began in the dining hall and spread into the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cellhouse </LOCATION> and the West Cellhouse of the century-old prison, said <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>. `` The disturbance certainly was gang-related, and considering the nature of the gangs here, it had definite racial overtones,'' <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> said 21 inmates were injured, and eight were hospitalized, most with stab wounds. One inmate was killed, said <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, who arrived at the scene shortly after the fight broke out around noon. Two staff members also suffered injuries, he said. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeburg </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Chester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said later that nine inmates were brought to the hospital. Four had gunshot wounds, he said. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said guards fired as many as 50 shots in breaking up the disturbance, which involved from 300 to 325 of the 700 <PERSON> Menard </PERSON> inmates who were out of their cells at the time. Most of the shots were warning shots fired into the air, <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said. He would not specify whether guards fired directly at inmates. But prison spokesman <PERSON> Nic </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> said the slain inmate was shot to death. He identified the dead inmate as <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, who was serving time for two counts of attempted murder. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> was asked if the guards killed the inmate and injured the four others. `` We do n't know that for a fact,'' he said. `` We would presume -LRB- so -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> said authorities would investigate where the gunshots came from. He noted, however, that prison officials had n't recovered any guns `` that were not to be there. The prison in southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> was locked down, and <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> said everything was under control. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> said the inmate population at <LOCATION> Menard </LOCATION> was 2,539 at the end of last week. `` That's 74 percent more than the prison was designed to hold,'' he said.

 A mother jailed for more than two years in a bitter child custody dispute said Tuesday her daughter is fine and she is proud of her. Dr. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, who was released from the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jail </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, said her daughter <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON> `` is not only all right she is more than all right.'' `` Two years ago, she was a terrified, traumatized victim of incest,'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> WUSA-TV </ORGANIZATION>. `` Today she is a proud, happy girl who knows she is worth protecting, and I am very proud of her.'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> was jailed in August 1987 after she failed to produce <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON>, now 7, for a supervised court-ordered visit with her father, Dr. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON>. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> claims <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON> sexually abused the child; <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON> has repeatedly denied the allegation. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s release was the result of a law passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and signed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last week limiting civil contempt jail terms in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> to 12 months. The law expires after 18 months. <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON>, appearing Tuesday on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' program, said he was glad <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> was out of jail. `` I only wish this could be coupled with some concern for my missing daughter. I would have been in support of that bill if the bill had a provision mandating a government agency such as the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> be required to find my daughter,'' <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> has declined to reveal the girl's whereabouts. At a news conference late Monday, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said that for the immediate future, she would spend time with her fiance, federal appeals court judge <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>. `` I will go wherever my fiance takes me,'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said. When <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> was asked about his plans for the couple, he only smiled and shook his head. `` I'd rather not say,'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said she wanted a thick steak, salad and a bottle of red wine. `` Oh, I suppose I'll get my hair cut, my teeth cleaned, the kinds of things I have n't been able to do for the past two years,'' she said. `` Beyond that, I can not say.'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> credited a groundswell of grassroots support with creating the climate for the drafting of the congressional legislation that ultimately freed her. `` I am very happy, and very grateful, for those who backed me and stayed with me,'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said. `` They made the difference.''

 <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s anti-communist guerrillas, disappointed that U.S.-supplied munitions dwindled when Soviet forces left their country, wonder if Americans have lost interest in backing them to victory in their freedom struggle, a guerrilla commander said Tuesday. `` I am sorry to say some kind of mistrust has arisen,'' Brigadier <PERSON> Rahmatullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Safi </PERSON> told a group of reporters. The feeling now among the Afghan people and their guerrilla supporters is that `` Americans are very good people, but they leave you in the middle of the road ... instead of showing friendship to the end.'' `` The end of the road'' for the guerrillas and several million Afghan refugees still waiting in neighboring countries will be victory in the form of a legal Moslem government acceptable to the people of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to replace President <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON>'s communists ruling in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, he said. The interruption of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ammunition and weapons supplies just as the Soviets beefed up the Kremlin-installed Afghan government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> caused military setbacks and loss of confidence, but `` at the moment there is no problem in the supply ... we are satisfied with the continuation,'' said <PERSON> Safi </PERSON>, visiting <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for talks with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. He is currently head of intelligence for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION>, one of the more moderate of seven guerrilla groups trying to achieve unity under the framework of the U.S.-backed Afghan Interim Government. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has said it will back the interim government in efforts to oust the <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON> regime while also searching for a political solution. On early <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visits, while his homeland was still occupied by the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, `` we were met by Congressmen, rich people, who would take you to their private homes, doctors for our wounded,'' he recalled. Today, he said, `` there is still fighting in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> ... there are lots of wounded, but no doctors interested, no hospitals.'' As for <PERSON> Najibulla </PERSON>, `` he will not survive,'' said <PERSON> Safi </PERSON>. It was unrealistic, however, for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials to predict <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON>'s quick collapse in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, or seizure by the guerrillas of the town of <LOCATION> Jallalabad </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, he said. `` It is foolish to give a timetable. General <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>, General <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> never gave timetables,'' he said, naming successful <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British commanders of World War II.''

 Tap water became safe, some stores reopened Tuesday and a ton of catfish was on the way to ease the plight of this city's hurricane survivors, but 80 percent remained without power and stricken outlying areas grew desperate. Generators and other necessities poured in to this historic port from around the nation. The <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> arranged to send a ton of donated catfish along with cooks to fry it and serve it with hush puppies, the region's beloved cornmeal side dish. While <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> regained some services, the picture was bleaker in isolated areas. `` We have no ice, no lights and we're low on batteries,'' <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said. `` Everything is funneled to <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, but we had a hurricane, too. People are desperate. They're going to panic.'' He said roads were still blocked by downed trees, making it impossible to reach some people in the town of about 2,000 bordering the <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> north of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. `` We ca n't get to their houses to see even if they're still alive or not,'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said. Some other towns and the barrier islands had similar problems, officials said. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> and its remnants killed at least 33 people in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and 28 on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mainland, including 17 in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> schools remained closed for at least another week; some colleges in the area plan to open Monday. College football fans at five southern universities were expected to donate canned goods for the relief effort. <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> reopened to limited ship traffic Tuesday, and some traffic lights in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> and in nearby <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pleasant </LOCATION> were working. The <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> will open Thursday to commerical airline flights. Residents climbed onto roofs to repair shingles under a sunny sky, while others shopped in grocery stores opened for the first time. Rain that was predicted held off. `` They're cleaning the trees out of the streets. We're going to get along with help of the Lord,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gale </PERSON>, whose house collapsed when Hurricane Hugo swept through <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> on Thursday night and Friday morning. Power was restored to more than 100,000 people in the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION>, but nearly 300,000 remained without service. It could be a month before full service is restored. In <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said it had restored power to about 75,000 customers out of 230,000 who lost it. The others, including <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and his family, may have to wait up to two weeks, she said. Disaster assistance centers should be operating by Saturday in four counties around <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s public safety secretary Power and phone outages led the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> bankruptcy trustee to speed up plans to close <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, a 2,200-acre Christian theme park in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, that has been on the decline since the downfall of evangelist <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, where an estimated 50,000 people were still out of their homes, lines for water and ice were shorter as more stores opened and the city's water supply became potable. `` They're settling down today. Yesterday, they were kind of pushy,'' said <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilstrap </PERSON> at a <ORGANIZATION> Winn-Dixie </ORGANIZATION> supermarket in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> where workers distributed water and ice from trailer-trucks to a steady line of people. One arrest was reported for price gouging. A tree-clearing company told a homeowner it would cost $ 22,000 to clear a yard of some trees, Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said. About 650 <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> personnel were being sent to assist in the relief effort, while the <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> shipped water, food, cooking stoves, power generators, propane fuel and tools. The <ORGANIZATION> Fulton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> offered to open its warehouse stacked with $ 4 million in supplies to schools damaged in the storm. Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> announced the state would hire some of the estimated 224,000 workers displaced by the storm to help with cleanup efforts. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday expanded his earlier disaster declaration to include five more <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> counties, bringing to 12 the number eligible for federal money in the state. Banks began offering low-interest loans to those ineligible for federal aid, including $ 1.35 billion in below-market rate loans from <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION>. Black community leaders met in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> to discuss how to coordinate and spread relief efforts to rural areas. `` My people in <LOCATION> McClellanville </LOCATION> do not have water, they do not have food, no clothes. There are those who are sick and who do not have money to buy medicine,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, who lives in the town of 500. In <LOCATION> Sumter </LOCATION>, the scene was `` very chaotic,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> said. `` A number of people have been arrested for looting because of hunger,'' he said. `` Many of the roads are still blocked. People are hungry. We are in desperate need of a whole lot of help.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> began work on a temporary pontoon bridge to link devastated Isle of Palms and <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s Island to the mainland again, but the coastal resort of <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> remained closed and guarded by troops against looters. The bridge to the Isle of Palms and <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> was wiped out by the storm. Boats continued Tuesday to ferry residents of those two barrier islands to survey the damage to their homes. Residents were told to wait at least another day before beginning cleanup efforts while officials use helicopters to bring heavy equipment onto the island. Estimates of crop losses increased to $ 80 million to $ 90 million, and was expected to climb as more of the state's 5.3 million acres of cropland is surveyed, agricultural officials said. Damage to the state's forests was placed at $ 1 billion, state forestry officials said.

 Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> on Tuesday condemned violence by national movements and liberation struggles and said noble ends do not justify violent means. He did not praise the Palestinian struggle against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of captured <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> lands in his speech to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, and the message to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and other movements was unmistakable: `` Freedom must not be sought at the expense of others. `` No support or sympathy should be extended to the so-called movements that allow actions humiliating other nations, or use terrorist, barbaric and inhuman methods in waging their struggle.'' It was the most explicit renunciation yet of violence by groups which <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has supported in the past _ from those in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` The time has come finally to realize that not all means are good for attaining even the most noble ends ... The international community condemns and outlaws terrorism. `` We need equally determined action against any kind of violence, whatever the motives or excuses for it,'' he said. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> did not discuss specific conflicts, but emphasized the importance of international cooperation and moral behavior by all nations and groups. He addressed condemnation of violence in his speech even before disarmament and acceptance of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call to slash chemical weapons stockpiles. Diplomats said it signified a greater Soviet commitment to live up to its words about norms of international civilized behavior and common human values. They also cited Soviet desire to improve relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and to seek a comprehensive settlement in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` Violence by the state against its own people must be ruled out altogether,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said. `` Violence on national, ethnic or religious grounds must no longer be tolerated. `` We advocate freedom of choice. `` However, we reject its interpretation as a license to use any means, to commit any violence or to shed blood.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> admitted <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was disappointed by the setback of the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, but said, `` We are in no way prejudiced'' against the new government, led by non-communists. `` We wish it every success and are ready to cooperate with it.... We see nothing threatening in the fact that a coalition government has been formed in accordance with the will of the Polish people. He said that if tolerance `` is mandatory for us in our attitude toward the current government of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, why are others so intolerant as regards, say, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>?'' It was a clear reference to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dislike of Cuban Communist leader <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. In his first address since he became <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s foreign minister last month, <PERSON> Taro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakayama </PERSON> explained the new, activist foreign policy of his government Tuesday, including a greater, non-military role in <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping worldwide. <PERSON> Nakayama </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would welcome simultaneous or separate <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> membership for both South and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and said <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> was trying to improve its own relations with <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> seeks to improve its relations with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and resolve the issue of the Soviet-occupied Northern Territories. <PERSON> Nakayama </PERSON> said `` recent events in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'' disturbed the Japanese, a reference to the violent suppression of a student-led democracy movement in June. But he said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> expects <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s policies of reform and openness to remain unchanged. <PERSON> Nakayama </PERSON> announced that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is prepared to provide $ 600 million from 1990 to 1992 to help the poorest countries in sub-Saharan <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and elsewhere restructure their economies. `` As <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> interacts with the rest of the world more intensively and in a broader spectrum of fields,'' he said, `` it realizes that it must play a more active role in international affairs.''

 `` The Cosby Show'' turned up the Nielsen ratings heat with its sixth season premiere, taking its first No. 1 spot since February and pushing `` Roseanne'' into No. 2. `` Chicken Soup'' showed signs of chilling. `` The Cosby Show,'' featuring the return of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonet </PERSON>'s character <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> with a new husband and child in tow, had a 26.1 rating and 44 percent of the Thursday night audience for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> `` Cosby's'' last No. 1 rating was Feb. 27. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> had six of the Top 10 shows, including returning veterans `` Cheers,'' `` The Golden Girls'' and `` Matlock.'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> had three shows and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> had one. Ratings are the percentage of the estimated 90.4 million homes with television sets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The share is the percentage of sets in use. New shows in the Top 20 were a premiere of `` Hardball'' on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, in 16th place, and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Major Dad,'' which captured 20th place. A <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> special dedicated to the late comedian <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> was ranked 11th with a 19.3 rating. `` Roseanne,'' on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, captured a 24.7 rating and a 38 percent share of the audience, according to figures released Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Comic <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s `` Chicken Soup,'' after placing No. 2 in the ratings last week behind `` Roseanne,'' fell to 14th place in its second week. `` Chicken Soup'' follows `` Roseanne'' on Tuesday night, but lost 6.3 rating points in the transition, with an 18.4 percent rating and 29 share. `` Chicken Soup'' played opposite a season premiere of `` Matlock'' on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and CBS' new series, `` Wolf.'' A special Tuesday preview of `` <PERSON> Doogie </PERSON> <PERSON> Howser </PERSON>, M.D.,'' producer <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Bochco </PERSON>'s latest entry for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, tied with <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Murder She Wrote'' for sixth place. The show about a teen-age doctor got a 20.7 rating and a 32 share of the audience. Its regular time slot is Wednesday night, where it earned a 14.4 rating and 23 share for 33rd place. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> also scored with its 15th anniversary show for `` Saturday Night Live,'' broadcast in prime time Sunday night against <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Preppie Murders. The `` Saturday Night'' special was No. 8, while the movie about the slaying of a young socialite in Central Park was 26th. The Top 10 shows and their ratings were: `` The Cosby Show,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, 26.1; `` Roseanne,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, 24.7; `` Cheers,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, 24.1; `` Golden Girls,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, 23.5; `` Sister <PERSON> Kate </PERSON>,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, 23; `` Murder, She Wrote,'' <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, 20.7; `` <PERSON> Doogie </PERSON> <PERSON> Howser </PERSON>, M.D.'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, 20.7; `` Saturday Night Live 15th Anniversary Show,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, 20.3; `` <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON>,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, 19.6; and `` Who's the Boss,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, 19.5. New shows featuring television veterans did not grab top spots with viewers. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The <ORGANIZATION> Nutt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' starring <PERSON> Cloris </PERSON> <PERSON> Leachman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Korman </PERSON> and produced by <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, checked in at No. 24. `` Island Son,'' marking the return of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> to series television was in 42nd place for CBS. `` A Peaceable Kingdom,'' starring onetime bionic woman <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, was a less-than-overpowering 65th place for CBS. Under network programming tactics, new shows are either premiered or previewed _ the latter signifying a show broadcast outside its assigned time slot. Some new series had two broadcasts during the week. The highest ratings for other-new-show previews and premieres for the week include `` The Famous Teddy Z,'' CBS, No. 22; `` Perfect Strangers,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, No. 29; `` Free Spirit,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, No. 30; `` The People Next Door,'' <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, No. 31; `` Family Matters,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, No. 38; `` The Young Riders,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, No. 40; `` Baywatch,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, No. 48; `` Top of the Hill,'' <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, No. 55; `` Snoops,'' CBS, No. 57; `` Life Goes On,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, No. 61; `` Saturday Night with <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chung </PERSON>,'' CBS, No. 72. <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Booker'' premiered in 77th place. CBS' `` 48 Hours'' special on Hurricane Hugo was in 39th place. The nightly network news shows were ranked as follows: `` CBS Evening News,'' in first place with an 11.2 rating; `` ABC World News Tonight'' in second with 10.2; and `` NBC Nightly News'' in third, also with a 10.2 rating. The <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> rating is based on four nights due to satellite problems Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has told <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> it will revise the numbers at a later date.

 A gunman robbed a bank Tuesday, fled with four employees and later ran over two of them with his car, killing one and injuring the other, police said. State police in <LOCATION> Battle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> said a man was arrested at a roadblock later Tuesday and was being held for questioning. Authorities recovered some cash and a weapon when the man was arrested. Lt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said a man wearing a hood met the employees as they entered the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> branch </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Perry </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> shortly before 9 a.m. When the vault opened, the gunman took an undetermined amount of money. He forced four employees to go with him when he fled in his auto. He returned minutes later and ordered three of the employees to get into one of their cars and follow him, keeping one with him to make sure the others followed, police said. After traveling about 30 miles, the two cars stopped north of <LOCATION> Battle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, drove a little father in one car and the man ordered all four employees to lie side-by-side on the shoulder of the road. He then tried to back his car over them, hitting two, the lieutenant said. Two others ran. The gunman shot at them but missed, he said. The victim was identified as <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Parks </PERSON>, 55, of <ORGANIZATION> Owosso </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, was in serious but stable condition at <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where she was transfered from a <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> hospital, said Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerwick </PERSON> Two others were shaken up but not injured, said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Helterhoff </PERSON>, agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, said possible charges against the man include bank robbery, abduction, and murder.

 Motorists got so fed up with a reckless driver that they took matters into their own hands, boxing in his truck at a truckstop and holding him until police arrived. A tractor-trailer rig was weaving in and out of traffic Sunday on the <LOCATION> Adirondack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northway </LOCATION> near the town of <LOCATION> Chazy </LOCATION>, tailgating and nearly running some cars off the road, said Trooper <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Triller </PERSON>. After several miles, five motorists _ all strangers _ pulled over, discussed the situation and decided to act, <PERSON> Triller </PERSON> said. One went to summon police while the other four sped northward and caught up with the truck just south of the Canadian border. When the truck exited the highway and drove to a nearby truckstop, the motorists boxed in the truck and kept the driver, <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Fortier </PERSON>, 31, of <PERSON> Mercier </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, until police arrived and arrested him.

 An immigration official `` had a change of heart'' Tuesday and decided to release on bond a 27-year-old student from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> who was detained when she arrived seeking asylum, her attorney's office said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ilchert </PERSON>, regional director of the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, earlier ruled against bond for <PERSON> Hoy </PERSON> <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yi </PERSON> after a doctor reported her to be in good health. But later <PERSON> Ilchert </PERSON> `` had a change of heart,'' said <PERSON> Hoy </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>. The regional director is the only person who can approve bond in immigration cases. Federal Immigration Judge <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hornbach </PERSON> suggested the checkup last week after a hearing in which <PERSON> Hoy </PERSON> appeared pale, grimaced and said she was suffering from severe ulcerlike symptoms. <PERSON> Hoy </PERSON> and her fiance, <PERSON> Luo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jian </PERSON> <PERSON> Guang </PERSON>, 32, were taken into custody Aug. 7 when they arrived in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> saying they feared reprisals for anti-government protests if they return to their homeland. Immigration officials have the right to detain asylum-seekers who arrive without visas or to release them on bond. While the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> said it has not taken a position on the asylum request, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has filed a report saying it does not believe the students have proven they have a well-founded fear of persecution if they go back to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Their attorney, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said he will continue to fight deportation and pursue bond for <PERSON> Luo </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Hoy </PERSON> has relatives with whom they could stay. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> decided after the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> massacre in June to allow the estimated 73,000 Chinese students in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to remain even if their visas expired. But that decision did not affect people who arrived later. <PERSON> Hoy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Luo </PERSON> were studying in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> when they helped organize a rally deploring the June 4 massacre of hundreds, perhaps thousands of people by government troops on their way to recapture Tiananmen Square from pro-democracy students. They said <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> took pictures of them, and they received phone calls at home that threatened them for their protest. Both students' fathers were jailed during the Cultural Revolution in the'60s, and they testified last Friday that they expect to be jailed if they return to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

 The Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday endorsed an additional cut of nearly $ 300 million in President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Star Wars program as part of a $ 288 billion military spending bill. By a vote of 66-34, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejected an amendment that would have restored that sum to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Star Wars program to meet the $ 4.5 billion total approved by the chamber in its authorization bill passed in August. Instead, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> accepted a total for the Strategic Defense Initiative that falls about $ 900 million short of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s request for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The spending bill's total is about $ 4.1 billion _ $ 3.7 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s SDI program and $ 355 million for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and military construction. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> accepted those totals on a voice vote and continued debate on the bill, which was expected to take several days. Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, D-Neb., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> who voted against restoring the $ 300 million, said `` there is n't any question'' that suport for SDI is `` extremely weak'' in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Later, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejected, 71-29, an amendment that would have cut $ 2.7 billion from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s request for $ 4.7 billion next year to buy and test the first 13 models of the B-2 stealth bomber. Proponents of the bat-winged aircraft argued that a U.S.-Soviet treaty reducing strategic arms would be impossible without the plane. Opponents complained that the cost of $ 530 million for each of 132 planned bombers was excessive. During a session that lasted late into the night, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved by a vote of 65-34 a non-binding resolution calling on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> before April 1, 1990 on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military's presence in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON>, D-Ark., had proposed a reduction of 3,000 in the 43,800 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed in the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> nation, but the `` sense of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>'' measure was adopted instead Earlier in the day, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> overwhelmingly endorsed shutting down 86 military bases and scaling down five more, approving the cost-saving plan to close bases. The vote was 86-14. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> totals for Star Wars are still far more than what was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> _ $ 3.1 billion _ and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has not compromised on the issue, according to one <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiator. `` It's now clear that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is not about to accept the number that the authorizers agreed to in our bill,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> The defeated amendment, sponsored by Republican Sens. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, also included a series of changes to the bill approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> and Wallop would have restored $ 910 million for the submarine-based, long-range Trident 2 nuclear issile, reduced funds for the Apache helicopter and earmarked $ 395 million for conventional weapons such as Stinger, <LOCATION> TOW </LOCATION> and HARM missiles. The defeated amendment also would have reduced the money for fast transport ships from $ 1 billion to $ 20 million and provided money for one rather than two icebreakers. On Star Wars, <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON> had argued that the increase in the substitute amendment would have provided `` barely a minimum to sustain confidence'' in the program. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Wallop </ORGANIZATION>, `` funded it at a level which it can not succeed. What they are doing to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people is lying to them.'' But Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, said the amount for <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> was a `` prudent position considering the current status of that program.'' And Sen. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., noted that the Soviets this past weekend indicated that they were divorcing Star Wars from any U.S.-Soviet treaty to reduce strategic arms `` The Soviets are not so concerned about SDI anymore,'' <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said. In other action, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved: _ Transferring $ 135 million from the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for the restart of the three tritium reactors at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> nuclear plant _ Providing $ 20 million in military assistance for <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> This amendment was introduced at the request of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and approved by voice vote. _ Approved aid to repair and rebuild military facilities in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> damaged last week by Hurricane Hugo The total cost of the aid plan was not immediately available but Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, the plan's sponsor, said that $ 50 million was for a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> shipyard in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> and $ 25 million was for <ORGANIZATION> Shaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. On base closings, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved an amendment that effectively eliminates a provision that would have held up $ 300 million for the base closings until the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> certified that the savings exceeded the cost. A federal commission, in making its recommendation last December, estimated a savings of $ 5.6 billion over 20 years. Then <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> accepted the panel's plan and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last spring upheld the proposal. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action on the measure sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, came despite appeals from a handful of members petitioning on behalf of their home-state bases Prior to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said further cuts in the defense budget by the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may force him to close more bases. `` Given all the demands to redirect dollars from the defense budget to other areas, I've got no choice but to find ways to close additional bases,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> told reporters the day after <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats and the administration reached a tentative agreement to boost President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s anti-drug effort by $ 900 million. The plan requires a cut of about $ 1.3 billion in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget. In te debate over base closings, Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, argued that a mistake had been made and the provision simply asks `` that the comptroller general analyze.'' Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill., who has fought plans to close <ORGANIZATION> Chanute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Rantoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, charged that the commission `` cooked the books. Behind the scenes, the lobbying firm of <LOCATION> Patton </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> and <PERSON> Blow </PERSON> urged members to vote against the <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> amendment. Picking up the lobbyists tab of about $ 30,000 were residents and businesses near <LOCATION> Chanute </LOCATION> Air Force Base, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. Voting against the base closings amendment were Sens <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON>, R-Ind.; <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill.; <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>; <PERSON> Spark </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>, R-Ky.; <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill.; <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>

 For everything there is a season, particularly TV. For <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> viewers, the season noisily began last week, full of ceaseless drumbeating, store tie-ins and the newest twist, clips of new shows on airline flights. That is a far cry from the way they do things overseas. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey of four nations _ <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> _ shows that the new TV seasons in three of these countries make the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> version seem a September epic in bloat. In the fourth, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, there is no television season as such. New programs are introduced on a seemingly random basis, with the dominant entertainment form the `` telenovela,'' the Mexican soap opera. Few shows are from north of the border, although viewers can and do watch <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> entertainment and news programs on cable. Depending on which networks they're watching, Japanese viewers get two new TV seasons each year. One starts in early October, the other on April 1. They also face season-starting fanfare for the programs, most of which are domestically produced; few <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> shows air for long in prime time and usually are consigned to late-night slots. Examples of these include `` Night Rider,'' `` Airwolf'' and `` MacGyver.'' As in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, new programs are played up in TV and newspaper ads. And Japanese networks sometimes assemble stars of new shows for variety or quiz shows that constitute a preview of the coming season. But this hoopla is small in scale. It's nothing comparable to the megabuck `` watch-us'' campaigns of the American networks. There is a fall TV season in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. But unlike the American version, which began on Sept. 18, the British season starts politely. There is no designated kickoff day, and there's none of the massive promotion that attends the arrival of the new season in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. American shows still are in the minority in this season's British schedules, which still lean to the important and serious in programs, or programs, as they spell them there No matter that one new British entry on BBC2, `` The Young Ones,'' makes <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>'s racy `` Married ... With Children'' seem like <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Coward </PERSON>, according to some observers. You want serious? The <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> has on its fall schedule a show called `` Art in the Third Reich,'' while another outlet, Channel 4, the most arty of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s channels, plans a six-hour version of `` The Mahabhrarata,'' a dramatization of the Indian poem about the creation of mankind. But not all is staid at the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION>. It has one homegrown attempt at lowbrow this season, `` Challenge Anneka,'' in which the very blond and enthusiastic <PERSON> Anneka </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, clad in a jumpsuit, takes on viewer-suggested challenges each week. And it has American shows. It's adding `` Spenser: For Hire'' and `` Police Squad'' to its fall roster, which already has `` <ORGANIZATION> Cagney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON>,'' `` She's the Sheriff' and, in the late night, the elderly `` The <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> Show'' and `` The Honeymooners.'' Channel 4's fall roster, like others in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, also has its share of <ORGANIZATION> Yank </ORGANIZATION> shows, among them `` St. Elsewhere,'' `` <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> and <PERSON> Allie </PERSON>,'' `` Happy Days,'' `` I Love <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>,'' and the old <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> miniseries, `` North and South.'' There are four TV seasons in tiny <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, where the government runs two channels, one English-language, the other Arabic. The seasons include one during the Moslem holy month of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>, when the emphasis is on religious programming. But none of the four seasons start with any fanfare. In fact, viewers have to make a determined effort to learn when and which programs are on. There is plenty of Western programming fare, which has included even <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Lonesome Dove'' and <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION>'s campaign-trail spoof, `` Tanner'88.'' But the most popular shows are prime-time soaps like `` Knots Landing,'' `` Falcon Crest,'' and the most popular, `` Dynasty.'' However, all air without the steamy sex scenes to which American viewers are accustomed. Because of religious law in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, these scenes are cut. Thus, viewers may see a man and woman approaching each other, nostrils flaring, then see them talking of other matters. There's an absence of soap opera on <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> TV now. Replacing them in the current season is programming that mainly is geared to school students. The soaps wo n't be back until the start of the next new TV season _ in January.

<HEAD>Buying A Car _ A Real Shopping Experience</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the beginning there were no sticker prices on windows of new automobiles and the public was confused about prices, so the federal government mandated stickers and people became more confused. These people saw millions of look-alike cars on the highway but they had difficulty finding two in the showroom with identical stickers. That's because cars came with a myriad of options, and the dealer might have added more. Those add-ons added up, and some of them were very peculiar, sufficiently so to befuddle the potential buyer. To the Manufacturers Suggested Retail Price were added charges that included freight, preparation and even advertising. Well, the wary buyer thought, this is the way you do business in cars and who am I to buck the system? But, he continued to wonder, is n't that a bit peculiar? I do n't buy my TVs, ovens, refrigerators or even my house that way. The buyer discovered that many of the options were n't options at all _ they were already on the car. And he discovered there were more to come. After agreeing to buy the car he learned it was n't well equipped for the elements That being so, the salesman advised the buyer to consider the paint and internal protection package, rustproofing and an extended warranty. Is n't it foolish, he was asked, to buy a new car and not protect it? Then came the financing. The customer could finance through the company or he could try for his own. The complications rose. Should he take out a lower cost long-term loan or a higher cost short-term loan? It was enough to confuse a computer, and the insurance was yet to come. What to insure, who to insure, how much to insure? After failing to comprehend his warranty, the buyer had no energy left to read the insurance policy. Having gone through this maze a couple of times, however, the potential car buyer felt a growing sense of mastery. It might have taken a decade or so, but he had caught on to the ways and manners of carmakers and their dealers. Then came below-market interest rates and rebates. Those prices stamped to the car window, confusing to begin with, meant even less now because cars were n't selling for those prices. You had a choice: rebate or low interest. Well, it might have seemed that simple, but when you went to the dealer you found that only certain cars were discounted and those were n't the ones you wanted. And you found that the low, low interest rates did n't apply uniformly. You went home to work it out. Which should I take, rebate or low-interest loan? Which would leave me ahead of the game? Should I finance through my bank or the company? Long-term or short-term? Should I take out credit insurance to cover repayments on the chance I might be injured? Wising to the ways of the marketplace, you loved to see companies get into competition with each other, especially near the end of the selling season, when they had to get rid of the old inventory before introducing new models. Like now. You bided your time, worked out the figures in advance and prepared yourself to pounce on the best deal available. After all, you said, carmakers have already announced price increases for the following year. Well, it's true, they did raise prices, but maybe they did n't mean it One of them, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, already has announced discounts from the higher prices on some of its new model-year cars even before the selling season begins. This has produced a situation in which the new, higher-priced cars might possibly be available at less than the prices pasted on the older, lower-priced cars. Put that in your computer and see what comes out. Right now, some analysts of the automotive industry think that <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> will join <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> in discounting, but of course each company will have its own special formula for you to endlessly mix, match and compare at your leisure. Nobody tries to look far into the future of anything economic today, since the footing keeps shifting and distorting the perspective. But you should be aware that if competition intensifies the new terms might have to be revised.

<HEAD>Syrian Shellings Killed Millions of Fish off Christian Enclave</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Recasts throughout to take in account that shelling has stopped
with recent cease-fire in Beirut. No Pickup.</HEAD>

 Six months of Syrian shellings have killed millions of fish in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> off this Christian enclave near <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and threatened one of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s few natural resources, a government ecologist says. The shellings stopped with the recent cease-fire in the battle for <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> but damage to the fish population and the livelihoods of local fishermen remain critical. `` Our sea is dying,'' ecologist <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Malichev </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said in an interview. `` It's become rotten and polluted. Our marine life is nearing its end and we have no fish for next year.'' He estimated that along with the millions of fish killed, billions of their eggs also perished. <PERSON> Malichev </PERSON> said fish not killed by the hundreds of exploding 130mm howitzer shells and salvoes of rockets were poisoned by tetryl, one of the explosive elements in the shells that is released into the water. The shellings also forced most of the enclave's 500 fishermen to remain ashore. But about 75 of them risked going out after dark to gather the thousands of fish that would float up dead on the surface after each shelling. `` After a heavy round of shelling, the dead fish float like a carpet on the surface,'' fishermen <PERSON> Sirop </PERSON> <PERSON> Ornakian </PERSON> said before the cease-fire took effect. `` We usually wait a bit and then head for the carpet. Most times I collect about 25 kilograms -LRB- 55 pounds -RRB- of fish every trip.'' The Syrians shelled the 28-mile coastal enclave and its waters to keep cargo ships and tankers from running a blockade with supplies for the Christian forces of Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> in the battle of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` The shelling has killed our season,'' said <PERSON> Kivork </PERSON> <PERSON> Manoukian </PERSON>, a fisherman for more than 40 years. `` Usually this time of the year is the best for us, when we make some money. But this year's been catastrophic.'' His friend, <PERSON> Arten </PERSON> <PERSON> Khishkhishian </PERSON>, said he gave up fishing because his nets were torn by twisted rocket casings and lumps of shrapnel littering the shallow waters off <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> and the ancient port of <LOCATION> Byblos </LOCATION> a few miles north. `` I've had to repair my net three times and that cost more than 100,000 pounds -LRB- $ 200 -RRB-,'' he said. `` I decided to stop this ` shrapnel fishing' until there's lasting peace.'' But the others risked their lives and their boats, 15-foot craft powered by outboard motors, to haul in the dead fish. Sometimes a Syrian barrage would come unexpectedly. Police said several fishermen were wounded. <PERSON> Kevork </PERSON> <PERSON> Manoukian </PERSON> said that on one night `` it looked quiet so I dropped my net.'' `` Then the next minute a shell hit about 100 meters away from my boat,'' he said. `` I ditched my net and made it for the shore in panic as more shells exploded around me.'' Ornakian and other fishermen went out regularly for catches not much bigger than those they were netting before the fighting. With fish in short supply in the enclave, the price has doubled to the equivalent of about $ 4.50 a pound. Ornakian and the others reckon that the money they made from each trip _ the equivalent in Lebanese pounds of about $ 250 _ was worth the chance. Moslem fishermen are banned from the waters off <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, where the Syrians deployed batteries of long-range artillery along the waterfront to shell the Christian coastline. But the Moslems are able to fish south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for 50 miles down the coast to the ancient port of Tyre, where the biggest danger they face is an occasional Israeli gunboat.

 <PERSON> Ty </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who plays a character called `` The Kid'' on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Young Riders,'' says that although he grew up with horses he was more interested in motorcycles. He's in the saddle every day now for this new Western series about the founding of the Pony Express. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> plays the central character of six young men in the show who sign up to carry the mail from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joseph </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, in April 1860. The show's original title was `` The Kid.'' `` I ride but I do n't ride very well,'' said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who grew up in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in a family that ran a Christmas tree business. `` We always had horses, but it's like when you have a swimming pool and you spend your time at the beach. I spent more time riding motorcycles than horses. We had 2 -LCB- acres and a stable. The horse I rode is now 26 and ca n't be ridden anymore.'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and all the members of the cast were sent to cowboy camp for a quick course in how to stay in the saddle. It was run by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundin </PERSON>, head wrangler for the series. `` I'm finding you just have to get on a horse and ride and ride,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` It's not a textbook thing. In the pilot we only used stunt men for a few shots. They did the dangerous falls. We did all the flat-out riding.'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was more concerned with going to <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, to film in 100-degree weather in his leather costume. His character and co-star <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>'s character, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cody </PERSON>, later to become famous as <PERSON> Buffalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>, wear buckskin. This is the first Western for <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who appeared as bellhop <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> LLoyd </PERSON> in the final season of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Hotel.'' `` My role on ` Hotel' was pretty limited,'' he said. `` Mostly I stood in the lobby and said, ` Good morning, how are you? May I take your bag?' Those of us who worked in the lobby were n't involved in the main stories.'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> acknowledges the `` The Young Riders'' series takes license with the facts for dramatic reasons. `` They keep most of us around the station, more so than would happen in real life,'' he said. `` That's for the sake of the stories. We'll say there is n't a mail pouch to take out. I think the riders spent more time on the road.'' Pony Express riders usually averaged 75 miles, changing horses at relay stations every 10 to 15 miles. Occasionally, a rider was required to ride a longer distance. There were 80 riders to cover 1,966 miles in 10 days. The service ended in October 1861 with the completion of the telegraph from coast to coast. `` Not one rider was killed and only one mail pouch was lost,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. He describes his character in the series this way: `` The Kid is very honest and trustworthy. He's the moral center of the group. He's level-headed, kind of reserved. He does n't act on impulse. He's the natural leader of the riders.'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> grew up in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. His mother was an artist and his father ran the Christmas tree business. `` My brother runs the business now,'' he said. `` It's the largest Christmas tree retail business in the country. We sell two million trees a year on 52 lots from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> himself appeared headed for a business career when a girlfriend at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> urged him to audition for a commercial. He went to 40 auditions before he got his first job, a silent part in a commercial for a canned ham. After that he did guest roles on such shows as `` Growing Pains,'' `` Our House,'' `` Valerie'' and `` <PERSON> Macgruder </PERSON> and Loud.'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was the last one cast in `` The Young Riders.'' He read for the role five times and it was down to <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and another actor before he was approved. Like `` The Virginian,'' his character has no name. He's known only as `` The Kid.'' `` I'm thinking about what I'll do ... if it comes up that I have to sign my name,'' he said. `` I guess I'll just put down an ` X.'''

<TEXT>
 Cuddled in her father's arms, 3-year-old <PERSON> Masuma </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> emerged from the belly of a huge military cargo plane and gingerly raised her deformed, web-like left hand damaged when Soviet warplanes bombed her house in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Masuma </PERSON>, a shy child dressed in a native outfit, is among the most recent group of Afghan war victims brought to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for medical treatment under a program operated by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, private volunteers and doctors who donate their time and expertise. After landing at this base outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ just minutes before President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Air Force One touched down on the same tarmac _ <LOCATION> Masuma </LOCATION> and nine other Afghans were taken in a bus to the base hospital. There, they sat on beds, intrigued by the small television sets at the side. They spent one night at Andrews before scattering to hospitals around the country. With her father, <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON>, <PERSON> Masuma </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, where doctors were to operate on her hand, which healed improperly after it was burned in a fire at her house. She is expected to stay three months before returning <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Other compatriots went to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jamestown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. Said Mir, 22, who walks on crutches as the result of a gunshot wound he suffered two years ago, might have to undergo a bone graft in <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, his destination But simply arriving in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> buoyed his spirits. `` I feel nice,'' the Dari-speaking Mir said through an interpreter as he sat down to a meal of chicken, potatoes and carrots, served with plastic utensils that some refugees found unnecessary. Since the Afghan airlift began in March 1986, 825 wounded Afghans have been flown out of neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> for treatment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. About half have come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I think it's really been a successful program,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>., who worked on the legislation that set up the program The airlift works in conjunction with the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s use of military transport planes to fly surplus goods into <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> for delivery across the border to anti-communist rebels in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The planes deliver supplies and then, on their return, are loaded with injured Afghans who are tended to by military medical teams. Some $ 10 million was allocated to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s humanitarian office for the program in the 1989 fiscal year, an amount that is expected to be duplicated in the coming year. The work of finding hospitals and families to care for the wounded Afghans falls to the <ORGANIZATION> Intergovernmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Migration </ORGANIZATION>, an international, non-political group that deals with refugees. The group has a contract with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to run the Afghan program. Patients are carefully screened and must meet specific criteria. They must be war-wounded Afghan refugees who can not get the treatment they need in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and who do not suffer from communicable diseases. They generally need reconstructive or other complicated surgery. <PERSON> Fran </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, who handles the Afghan account at the commitee, said hospitals in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sometimes use the Afghans as `` teaching cases'' because doctors do n't often see the kinds of war wounds suffered by the refugees. Typically, an Afghan receives up to $ 35,000 in free medical care in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. To place the wounded at hospitals and in homes for their rehabilitation, the committee seeks help from groups formed to support the Afghan rebels and from members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> interested in the issue. They include Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. During convalescence, the Afghans stay with local residents, often Moslems who understand their cultural needs such as dietary rules against eating pork. The big problem facing the committee these days is the shortage of hospitals agreeing to take the patients, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. There are roughly 450 Afghans in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> who have been approved for the program and are awaiting placement. One reason for the backlog is the decline in interest in the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> issue in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said: Since the Soviets withdrew their troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> last year, many Americans say, `` Wait a minute. I thought that war was over.'' Now, the U.S.-backed guerrillas are battling the Soviet-supported Afghan government of <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON>. Once they have been treated, some Afghans are not keen to return to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, where they typically must rejoin the 3 million Afghans in primitive refugee camps along the border. Their status, however, is not changed by their stay in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``A Dry White Season''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Marlon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brando </PERSON> returns to the screen in `` A Dry White Season'' after a lamentable nine-year absence. The not-so-good news is that he appears on the screen less than 10 minutes. Yes, he looks bulky, resembling <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> in his courtroom robe. Yes, he affects a British accent -LRB- how he loves props -RRB- that drew an initial titter from the preview audience. But no, the <PERSON> Brando </PERSON> magnetism has not diminished in his long layoff. He remains a dominating force. Like `` Cry Freedom'' and `` A World Apart,'' `` A Dry White Season'' was filmed in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> and looks at <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s apartheid from a white viewpoint The central figure is <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, a teacher at an exclusive white boy's school. He is vaguely unsettled by the signs of oppression all around him and by the tacit agreement with the government's policy by his family and fellow faculty members. Apartheid strikes close to <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> when his son's playmate and the boy's father are kidnapped, tortured and murdered by the Special Police. He enlists the help of the shadowy <PERSON> Zakes </PERSON> <PERSON> Mokae </PERSON>, a taxi driver with good connections; <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarandon </PERSON>, a liberal reporter; and a noted defense lawyer, played by <PERSON> Brando </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>'s efforts to seek justice are thwarted, and he loses his job, his wife, his standing in the white community and more. Even his own daughter betrays him. Only one element of hope remains: He has inculcated his young son with a sense of outrage at the vicious repression of the South African regime. The sure-handed direction of <ORGANIZATION> Euzhan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palcy </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- `` Sugar Cane Alley'' -RRB- and her talent for drawing the best from actors infuse `` A Dry White Season'' with suspense despite the inevitability of the outcome. She is superb at the handling of action scenes such as the massacre of children at <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, focusing on individual human tragedy. Her only annoying technique is the use of extreme closeups, especially on minor characters. <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> is perfect as the rational man whose growing fury at the regime's atrocities forces him to take action. Equally effective are <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzman </PERSON> as his icy, unsupportive wife; <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarandon </PERSON> as the fearless reporter; and <PERSON> Jurgen </PERSON> <PERSON> Prochnow </PERSON> -LRB- `` Das Boot'' -RRB-, as the embodiment of evil as the Special Police officer. The African actors bring substance and authenticity to the film, especially <PERSON> Zakes </PERSON> <PERSON> Mokae </PERSON> as <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>'s underground source, and <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Ntshona </PERSON> as the murdered boy's father. Both are South African exiles who have brought the anti-apartheid message to the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> theaters. In <PERSON> Brando </PERSON>'s two scenes, he re-emphasizes his position as the most exciting film actor of his time. Let's hope that his recent announcement of another retirement was another <PERSON> Brando </PERSON> prank. The MGM-UA release was produced by <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> and is rated R for language and brutal action. Running time: 106 minutes.

<TEXT>
 How much you enjoy the 1982 comedy `` Baby It's You'' may depend on your appreciation of three alumni of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s working class: <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON> and director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayles </PERSON> The year is 1967 and <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Rosanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Arquette </PERSON> -RRB- is a senior at a <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION> high school, an aspiring actress from an upper-middle class family who seeks acceptance to <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> College </PERSON>. She catches the attention of <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> `` Sheik'' Capadilupo, the swaggering, sharply dressed garbage man's son who ranks `` <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> and me'' as the most important people in his life. On the surface, another `` bad boy meets nice girl'' story. Sheik gets <PERSON> Jill </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> loses <PERSON> Jill </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> wins her back. But `` Baby It's You'' has much more to offer With humor and intelligence, <PERSON> Sayles </PERSON> touches on the conflicts of class and sex. What to do with choices, too many and too few. <PERSON> Sayles </PERSON> -LRB- `` Matewan,'' `` Eight Men Out'' -RRB- collaborated on the story with <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, whose experiences were closer to <PERSON> Jill </PERSON>'s. `` Certainly I could relate to both of them,'' <PERSON> Sayles </PERSON> said in a recent phone interview. `` A lot of kids ended up in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> or working in a factory or married with kids right out of high school. Your potential is cut off.'' Rock' n' roll, from the Trashmen to <LOCATION> Procul </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harem </LOCATION>, is everywhere, but <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>'s `` Strangers in the Night'' frames this video. It's heard three times: in a diner by the <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> shore, at the high school senior prom and at the <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> dance that closes the film, with a bewildered pyschedelic band honoring the request of Sheik and <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> `` There's definitely a line running through,'' <PERSON> Sayles </PERSON> said. `` One of the fascinating things was looking at all the different songs that came out around that time. Strawberry Alarm Clock, Motown, the Rolling Stones. There were so many kinds of music.'' <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> and <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON> are <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON>'s theme music. He glides through high school to <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>'s `` Hard to be a Saint in the City,'' mouths <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> songs at a rundown <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> nightclub and races up to <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> and a final reconciliation with <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> as <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON> grinds out `` Adam Raised a Cain.'' <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> gets a little bit of everything, pouting like <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> as she mimes the <ORGANIZATION> Supremes </ORGANIZATION>' `` Stop in the Name of Love!,'' joining her friends in a light-hearted chorus of `` Going to the Chapel'' and walking arm-in-arm with Sheik to <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s `` Stand by Me.'' The film's happy ending is possible only through an acceptance of limits. <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> fails miserably in her attempt to impress her sophisticated <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> friends; Sheik's <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> nightclub act is a washout. `` He has to realize that he's not <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> and she learns to take a little control over reinventing herself,'' <PERSON> Sayles </PERSON> said. `` What's nice about ` Baby It's You' is you get a chance to tell about other people's stories. <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> and I were talking about how the girls and guys in school always wanted to know what went on in the other lockerroom. This gave each of us a chance to do that.''

 `` Lassus _ Missa Osculetur Me'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Gimell </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The Tallis Scholars, directed by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>. `` Lassus _ Masses and Motets'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Nimbus </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> -RRB- Cathedral Choir, directed by <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Darlington </PERSON>. It was after solving the case of the <LOCATION> Bruce-Partington </LOCATION> plans that <PERSON> Sherlock </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> completed his monograph on the Polyphonic Motets of <PERSON> Lassus </PERSON>. Experts, according to Dr. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, rated it `` the last word upon the subject.'' It's unlikely that <PERSON> Lassus </PERSON>' motets will ever be exhausted. He composed 700 or so, of which only a few dozen have been recorded, in addition to his 60 settings of the Mass, 101 settings of the Magnificat, plus hundreds of madrigals and chansons. Born in 1530, <PERSON> Lassus </PERSON> was perhaps the most popular composer of his time. He not only wrote a lot of music, he wrote well, as two new recordings prove. The choir of <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> offers two Mass settings, three motets and a madrigal. The Missa Venatorum, barely 10 minutes long, shows <PERSON> Lassus </PERSON> at his most economical, the kind of music that might elevate the mind without aggravating the knees. Technically, the <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> choir can not match the Tallis Scholars' professional polish, but it is closer to the sound <PERSON> Lassus </PERSON> would have known The Missa Osculetur Me, recorded by the Tallis Scholars, illustrates <PERSON> Lassus </PERSON>' frequent technique of musical parody. In this case the Mass reworks his own motet set to the opening verses of the Song of Solomon: `` Let him kiss me ...'' The performances are ravishing, which is to say that they are up to the Scholars' usual mark. Is it peevish, then, to complain that the disc holds only 49 minutes of music? Encore, Mr. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, encore! _ By <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Southside'' -LRB- Mercury -RRB- - <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> The Scottish band <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> lives about as far from its namesake as one can get, but it has ambitions as large as the Lone Star state. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' new album, `` Southside,'' is one of the most promising debuts of 1989. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> shows a remarkable amount of maturity and self-assuredness for such a young band, and what `` Southside'' lacks in originality it makes up in consistent quality. The quartet's sound, like so many other mainstream rockers these days, is rooted in the acoustic guitar of frontwoman <PERSON> Sharleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiteri </PERSON>. But it's augmented by the distinctive blues guitar of <PERSON> Ally </PERSON> <PERSON> McErlane </PERSON> and the sort of throbbing bass that's more common to synthesizer bands. Those ingredients are most evident on `` I Do n't Want a Lover,'' this record's first single. That's not the best song on the album, however. The vote here goes to `` Thrill Has Gone,'' an understated country-flavored tune about the souring of a relationship. At times, McErlane's guitar and the wide open spaces of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' sound bring the state to mind <PERSON> Spiteri </PERSON> also understands well the differences between singing and shouting. Her lyrics travel the traditional terrain of relationships with neither great insight nor embarrassing simplicity. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> sometimes follows the traditional tendency of young bands to show their influences a little too openly. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> obviously listens to <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>, since the musical hook of `` Everyday Now'' vividly recalls `` I Shall Be Released.'' And the ringing guitars of `` Fool for Love'' sound a lot like U2. But this record is filled with strong melodies and performances. There are no weak cuts, a track record that would make most young bands _ as well as too many established ones _ envious. _ By <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauder </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 The first exhibition to probe the artistic dialogue between <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> and <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Braque </PERSON> during the years they collaborated on Cubism has opened at the Museum of Modern Art. It is perhaps the most important art event of the season, for Cubism was possibly a vision that could only have succeeded with the collective creativity of the two masters. `` We were like mountain climbers roped together,'' <PERSON> Braque </PERSON> recalled. `` Almost every evening, either I went to <PERSON> Braque </PERSON>'s studio or <PERSON> Braque </PERSON> came to mine. Each of us had to see what the other had done during the day,'' <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> once said. <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> and <PERSON> Braque </PERSON> pushed art beyond its traditional scope to a pure abstraction. Through Cubism, which utilized cubes and other geometric shapes to create forms, the two changed modern art. The exhibition includes 390 works in all mediums used by both <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> -LRB- 1881-1973 -RRB- and <PERSON> Braque </PERSON> -LRB- 1882-1963 -RRB-. The works are on loan from collections in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Basel </LOCATION>, and were also taken from the <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Modern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION>'s own collection.

 The blond giant stood tentatively on the stage of the Place des Artes theater, seemingly amazed at the standing ovation accorded him by the packed audience. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON> had come to the <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> for a tribute to his 30-year career that has brought distinction to movies on both sides of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. The program included clips from two widely divergent films: <PERSON> Ingmar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>'s `` The Virgin Spring'' -LRB- 1959 -RRB- and `` <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON> and Her Sisters'' -LRB- 1986 -RRB-. A dialogue with the actor was followed by a screening of the Danish-made `` Pelle the Conqueror,'' which drew the <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>'s best foreign-language film Oscar of 1988 as well as a nomination as best actor for <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON>. He received a second standing ovation when he left the stage. `` It's very strange,'' he admitted afterward. `` I do n't know how you feel, but I feel like I'm 25 inside. I do n't feel that I have any kind of ` lifetime achievement.''' Film critics would argue with that. If he had appeared only in the <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> films, <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON> would have earned a place in movie history. But he also has contributed a series of noteworthy performances in a wide variety of films, from the profound -LRB- <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> in `` The Greatest Story Ever Told'' -RRB- to the eerie -LRB- `` The Exorcist'' -RRB- to the frivolous -LRB- Ming the Merciless in `` Flash Gordon'' -RRB-. Like most successful actors, <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON>'s career was the result of a series of happy accidents. He was born 60 years ago in <LOCATION> Lund </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, the son of a university professor and his wife. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> happened to see some plays in nearby <LOCATION> Malmo </LOCATION>, prompting him to enroll in dramatic classes at high school. After his two-year military service, he enrolled in the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, training ground for such famous Swedes as <PERSON> Greta </PERSON> <PERSON> Garbo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON> played repertory at the <LOCATION> Malmo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Municipal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Theater </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> had been hired as chief director. When <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> filmed `` The Seventh Seal,'' he chose the young actor as a returning Crusader. The pair collaborated on 11 films. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> was impressed with <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON>'s strong, mystical persona and cast him in the mammoth, unrealized `` The Greatest Story Ever Told.'' `` <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'' with <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> was also a disappointment, but the two films established <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON> as an international star. He has been working all over the world ever since. Before leaving <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> for a new film in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON> paused for an interview with The Associated Press: Q. You have now directed your first film, `` <PERSON> Katinka </PERSON>.'' How did you like being on the other side of the camera? A. `` It was a great experience, very exciting. I had never had any plans to become a director, but this was something very special. It dealt with a novel I had found a long time ago; I fell in love with it immediately and saw it as a film with me playing a part in it. `` I tried to convince my director friends, but nobody caught on to it. Then someone approached me to direct the film, and I could n't turn it down. I was too old to play one of the parts, unfortunately. Time does these things to you. It was a great experience, exhausting, but I learned a lot.'' Q. At the tribute you mentioned that the first 20 years as an actor were a kind of therapy for you. What did you mean? A. `` I have a feeling that many actors choose acting because there's something they long for but can not reach, that there's something they can not express in their private lives, that there's a threshold they can not `` I was a very shy boy when I was a kid. I had difficulty to communicate with people I did n't know. When I started acting in an amateur group in high school, although I was n't aware of it at the time, I suddenly got a tool in my hand that was wonderful. I was allowed to express all kinds of strange things that I never dared to express before. Now I could do it with the character as a shield, as a defense, and as an excuse. `` I think that for many years I used my profession as some kind of a mental therapy. I worked all the time, and I needed it. I was restless, and I was very crazy if I was not allowed to work. Through the years I have backed off. Life has helped me, and my friends and my wife and my family. Today I do n't need that therapy anymore.'' Q. The acting life has sent you all over the world. Did you expect that when you started out? A. `` No, that happened later. It has its advantages and its drawbacks. But that can be very exciting. I'm grateful because I've seen so much of the world that I would n't have seen otherwise But sometimes you get a little too much of hotel rooms and suitcases and packing and unpacking. I think I'll try to take it a little easier in the future. `` I'm planning to do more theater, at least one production a year, limited engagement.'' Q. Where is home nowadays? A. `` My home is in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Funny thing is that I have n't spent much time there because I've been working elsewhere. We have an apartment which I like very much. It's a wonderful old palace in the old quarter of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. It's where <PERSON> Beaumarchais </PERSON> wrote ` The Marriage of <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON>.' It has been remodeled, and we have the attic of the house. `` We also have a summer place in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, and summer in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> is very important. I guess I am more of a country boy than a city boy, even though I grew up in a small town.'' Q. Your world travels have caused separations from your family, right? A. `` Not always, but for long periods. My wife comes along when I go to places she thinks she will enjoy. It's not easy. But I have a good wife, and we like each other very much. We have managed to stay together.''

 <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Furey </PERSON> worked night and day covering all surfaces in his apartment with painted cardboard hearts, bow ties, stars and squares; small plaster birds; dried lima beans and peas; clamshells from <LOCATION> Coney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>; mussel and oyster shells; and pieces of tile and glass. Heartbroken over the death of his wife, <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON>, <PERSON> Furey </PERSON> spent six years creating a memorial for her with mementos he found. Then, with nearly 80,000 objects on every wall, ceiling, cupboard and mirror, he left it all behind. He saw his work as an obsession fulfilled. The <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> sees it now as art unpreserved, and is taking steps to save <PERSON> Furey </PERSON>'s creation. `` I was absolutely astonished when I first saw it,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Head </PERSON> <PERSON> Millstein </PERSON>, the museum's associate curator of painting and sculpture. `` It looked like a jeweled grotto.'' The work was discovered last February after <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>, a real-estate developer, bought the building in which <PERSON> Furey </PERSON> had lived. After entering <PERSON> Furey </PERSON>'s apartment, he called the museum. <PERSON> Millstein </PERSON> hurried over. For the last few months, she has been trying to persuade the borough of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> to buy the apartment and preserve it on site. The lath walls and heavy plaster would crumble if removed, she said. She said she will document the work with photographs and a transcript of a lengthy interview with the 83-year-old <PERSON> Furey </PERSON>, once an ironworker on the Golden Gate and the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> bridges. <PERSON> Furey </PERSON>, who moved out of the apartment nearly a year ago after it was broken into twice, and now lives with his son, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Chester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, is amused by all the attention. As for being an artist, he's had no formal training, and the only museum he has ever visited is the American Museum of Natural History. He spent 14 to 18 hours a day on his project from 1982 to 1988, cutting out the cardboard figures of hearts, diamonds and bow ties -LRB- made in honor of his friend Bow Tie <PERSON> George </PERSON> -RRB-, and painting each one in a planned color scheme _ but few people then thought his work art. `` Most people looked at it, but they did n't see it,'' he said. <PERSON> Millstein </PERSON> said most people, including some members of <PERSON> Furey </PERSON>'s family, `` thought he was bananas. But not now. His work is called obsessive or personal art, <PERSON> Millstein </PERSON> said, adding that such art is rarely preserved. `` There's has n't been enough encouragement to save it because you ca n't take it to <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s or <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> and sell it,'' she said of the noted auction houses in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` It can be, as a matter of fact, quite ugly. It has more to do with obsession than it does with beauty.'' <PERSON> Furey </PERSON>'s outpouring is in the same vein as <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodia </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Watts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Towers </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, made out of concrete, seashells and broken glass; <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Trapani </PERSON>'s complex and decorative furniture, which he made in his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> home after his wife died in 1918; and <PERSON> Korczak </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziolkowski </PERSON>'s 35-year project of carving a <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> mountain in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> into a likeness of <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Crazy </PERSON> <PERSON> Horse </PERSON> _ a work his family has continued since his death in 1982. `` It's a private thing these people are doing. It's outside of the main art world,'' said <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, manager of the Cleveland-based Spaces, a gallery that promotes site-specific art. `` Most of these people do n't consider themselves artists. But they are very creative people. ... You look at their work, and you say, ` Holy smokes!''' <PERSON> Millstein </PERSON> said <PERSON> Furey </PERSON> is `` one of a group of artists who spring up all over the world, compulsively forced at some time in their life to finish a project. They usually have some kind of trauma in their life and they are driven to finish a project. A lot of them are older people who have a last burst of artistic creativity.'' Walking into <PERSON> Furey </PERSON>'s apartment is like stepping into a miniature museum that did n't put any of its collection in storage. The floor is the only bare space. He started in the bathroom, moved to the living room, then the kitchen, then the hallway, he said. He covered doors, both sides. He pasted cutouts around the edges of mirrors, and for ceiling work, he rigged up a scaffold. `` This is not slapdash, you know,'' <PERSON> Furey </PERSON> said. `` I would wake up at two, three, or four o'clock in the morning and start making cutouts. I'd paint them different colors and work for eight, or 10 or 12 hours. Then I'd take a nap in the recliner chair for a couple of hours and start up again.'' On the ceilings, he made rings around the light fixtures of shells, bow tie-shaped cardboard cutouts and cardboard stars. In the hallway, he nailed cement-filled shells to the walls. Some of the shells came from a neighborhood deli. A dining room wallpaper of a Western scene is partly covered with the decoupage. <PERSON> Furey </PERSON> also pasted cows, poodles, chipmunks and monkeys next to the wallpaper horses. Hearts are everywhere. Many are bright red. Many others are black. `` The whole project was more or less to kill time and to get over my grief of losing her,'' <PERSON> Furey </PERSON> said of his wife, who died in 1981. `` I had a lot of time on my hands, not much to do, and I missed her.'' <PERSON> Millstein </PERSON> said the objects represented different parts of <PERSON> Furey </PERSON>'s life, and many were for <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON>. The small birds, for instance, represented the couple's peaceful life together. The two had married during the Depression and moved into the apartment in the mid-1930s. They raised five children there. `` We had a good life together,'' <PERSON> Furey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Furey </PERSON>'s art reveals that it was, <PERSON> Millstein </PERSON> said. `` It's a five-room love story,'' she said.

 The King of the World. The Master of Disaster. The Big Man. After more than 20 years in rock' n' roll and almost as many nicknames, <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Clemons </PERSON> prefers the simple tag, Mr. <PERSON> C. </PERSON> `` All those names, it's a heavy cross to bear,'' said <PERSON> Clemons </PERSON>, the mightiest supporting star of <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>'s E Street Band. `` I think about all that stuff, but ` Mr. C' has evolved and he's the guy who combines all these things. Size, power and all-night parties are part of Mr. <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Personality </PERSON> counts, too. As <PERSON> Clemons </PERSON> says, it takes someone special to play the saxophone. `` You got to have an urban attitude, be a streetwise person,'' he said. `` I do n't know whether the saxophone made me this kind of person or if I was just born to play a saxophone. It's an extension of yourself. `` Nobody played instruments in my family. My father got that bug and said he wants his son to play saxophone. I wanted an electric train for Christmas, but he got me a saxophone. I flipped out.'' <PERSON> Clemons </PERSON> prides himself on being a survivor, staying around even when music involved far more than the simple joy of playing the sax. On tour now with <PERSON> Ringo </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> and a band that includes <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, <PERSON> Levon </PERSON> <PERSON> Helm </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Danko </PERSON>, <PERSON> Clemons </PERSON> is getting those old feelings back. `` Every night when <PERSON> Levon </PERSON> <PERSON> Helm </PERSON> breaks into ` The Weight,' I catch myself,'' <PERSON> Clemons </PERSON> said of the Band's drummer. `` When <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Danko </PERSON> goes into his bass, I have flashbacks to when I was young and wild and did n't understand a thing. `` You need to go back a little bit and remember how it was and how screwed up it got. It was a wonderful time. This whole tour is bringing back this stuff.'' <PERSON> Clemons </PERSON> also reaches back on his third solo album, `` A Night With Mr. C,'' which recalls a few other nicknames _ such as King, as in King <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, whose sweet saxophone was featured on hits by the Coasters, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aretha </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> and many others; <PERSON> Clemons </PERSON> covers <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON>'s party classic `` Twistin' the Night Away.'' `` King <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> is my mentor,'' <PERSON> Clemons </PERSON> said. `` I try to pattern myself after his style. He made a live record that's one of my favorites. ` Memphis Soul Stew' and ` Soul Serenade' are two songs that made me understand the kind of music I liked.'' <PERSON> Junior </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, Motown's hottest sax player of the'60s, is acknowledged with <PERSON> Clemons </PERSON>' version of `` Shotgun.'' <PERSON> Clemons </PERSON> also sings `` Quarter to Three,'' a hit for <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>'' <PERSON> Bonds </PERSON>, and does a duet with pop star <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnes </PERSON> on his own `` Dance, Dance, Dance.'' `` Singing's one of the hardest things,'' <PERSON> Clemons </PERSON> said. `` It was terrible, the first few times. `` I was so depressed I went into the house and did n't come out for six months. That still looms in the back of my mind. I sang in the church choir and was a great singer. I felt comfortable there.'' On stage, <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON> loves to remember the time he and E Street guitarist <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Zandt </PERSON> were on the boardwalk outside a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> club at four in the morning. Through wind and pouring rain, a large man appeared, dressed in white, carrying a saxophone. That, <PERSON> Clemons </PERSON> agrees, is how he and `` The Boss'' first met, back in the early'70s _ the short, skinny guitarist and his towering sideman. Like <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Clemons </PERSON> has some stories to tell. There was the time the E Street Band appeared on the same bill as rock' n' roll pioneers <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. `` It was at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> and we were <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>'s band,'' <PERSON> Clemons </PERSON> recalled `` Ten minutes before the show, no <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>. Five minutes later he walks in with his guitar, complains about something, and sends it back. He comes back and we walk on stage. `` The bass player -LRB- <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tallent </PERSON> -RRB- walks over to him and says, ` Hey, <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> what are we going to play?' <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> stops and says, ` I think we're going to play some <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> music.' We played the whole set with no rehearsal, no nothing. He never told you the next song.'' The rest quickly became history. By 1975, critic <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> had dubbed <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON> the `` future of rock' n' roll,'' leading to simultaneous covers on Time and <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION>. `` Born to Run,'' featuring <PERSON> Clemons </PERSON>' blistering solo, was an instant rock anthem, even gathering support as the official song of <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>'s native <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. But business soon set in. Legal hassles delayed <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>'s `` Darkness on the Edge of Town'' album Harsh words were exchanged all around. The simple joy of `` Rosalita'' and `` Thunder Road'' was gone. `` That was the beginning of it, that was a sign,'' <PERSON> Clemons </PERSON> said. `` The handwriting was on the wall for a lot of people, not just <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>. You look at the record companies and see the turnover in personnel and wonder what is going on.'' So <PERSON> Clemons </PERSON> chooses to look the other way, concentrating on his music and getting by as best he can. `` I tell people to get out of the business, forget about it. If you're not really, really special, forget about it. It's glamorous and beautiful and at the same time, it ai n't. You got to have faith and you got to have a lot of luck.''

 As a child growing up in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> was too smart to read The Saturday Evening Post. Now as a 56-year-old English professor and dean of faculty at <ORGANIZATION> Trinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, she's not only reading issues of the magazine she ignored as a girl, she's also written a book about what she learned. `` When I was growing up, it was always there,'' recalled <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON>, who graduated second in her <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION> high school class behind her more famous classmate, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` I, of course, never read it because I was a great intellectual snob. I would hug my <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON>. For my parents, it was part of their life, part of their expectation.'' <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON>'s parents were in good company. The publication grew from a book with no circulation, advertising or major writers to recommend it, to a national magazine with a circulation of nearly 3 million at its peak, <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> said. When she finally got around to reading the magazine, it took her 10 years to get caught up. She spent most of that time holed up in the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, thumbing through 38 years worth of the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>'s weekly issues _ almost 2,000 magazines. The research led to `` Creating America'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Curtis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 24.95 -RRB-. It's a 284-page book chronicling the magazine under <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorimer </PERSON>, the editor who from 1899 to 1936 transformed the Post from `` a cut-and-paste job of sentimental fiction and worse poetry'' to one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s great mass magazines, perhaps its greatest, according to <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON>. More than creating a great magazine, though, <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> says <PERSON> Lorimer </PERSON> sought to shape a great <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` The title -LRB- of the book -RRB- represents my idea that <PERSON> Lorimer </PERSON> was quite consciously trying to create an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' she said in a recent interview at her office at <ORGANIZATION> Trinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. `` He was worried about regionalism, about how you could bond all of this. I think what he did, in effect, was a gradual shaping and consolidating of the primary, deep movements of the American culture.'' One of the first things <PERSON> Lorimer </PERSON> did as editor was to announce on Dec. 30, 1899, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>'s plans for 1900. In a two-page advertisement, <PERSON> Lorimer </PERSON> asserted that the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> was neither a local publication nor a news weekly, but a magazine whose appeal is national. The ad proclaimed the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> would become the indespensible magazine and went on to describe the average American. `` -LRB- He -RRB- is an omnivorous reader,'' the ad said. `` His range of interests is wider than that of the citizen of any other country, and so it is necessary for a magazine that will meet his needs to be of the broadest scope possible.'' The ad promised to deliver fiction to `` satisfy a healthy appetite rather than attempt to create an abnormal one,'' as it worked to secure the greatest living writers. <PERSON> Lorimer </PERSON> made good on his promise. By 1900, the magazine carried stories by <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hamlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bret </PERSON> <PERSON> Harte </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Harding </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunbar </PERSON>. `` He genuinely wanted the best in fiction as he judged it, and he set out to get it by providing much more favorable terms than any other magazine offered,'' <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> writes in `` Creating America.'' `` The Post guaranteed to read stories within 72 hours of receipt and to pay on acceptance rather than on publication. Understandably, these policies paid off handsomely.'' Eventually, the Post would publish fiction by such writers as <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> and <PERSON> J.P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquand </PERSON>, and dispatches from around the world by <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Blythe </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON>, who reported from the front during World War I. Its covers would feature the work of <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON>, who once declined an offer by a competing magazine to double the price for his work out of loyalty to <PERSON> Lorimer </PERSON> and his magazine. Not everything about <PERSON> Lorimer </PERSON> was golden, however. Although he was a patriot, <PERSON> Lorimer </PERSON> thought getting involved in World War I was a disaster, and afterwards he became conservative and opposed any kind of progressive social movement, <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON> is a sales wonder. In 25 years, he has recorded 43 albums and sold 30 million LPs worldwide. One single record alone, `` The Last Farewell'' in 1978, sold 11 million copies. `` It's staggering, astonishing,'' said the 53-year-old <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON> in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` I face it as it comes along. It's great to know you can do it. If you think about it, you get a swelled head.'' His top-selling albums in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are `` The Best of <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON>'' and `` All My Best,'' both nearing sales of 1 million. Many of his records are sold through TV marketing, including `` Best Loved Ballads'' and `` All Time Heart-Touching Favorites.'' He has just released for over-the-counter sale another album, `` I'd Fall in Love Tonight,'' produced in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>. It includes country music standards like `` Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain,'' `` There Goes My Everything'' and `` Have I Told You Lately That I Love You.'' The singer-songwriter-guitarist now records for <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> after 19 years and 19 albums with RCA. Singing in three languages _ English, French and <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> _ has widened his appeal. <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON> also has gained a larger audience through hawking his albums on TV. Universal Records thinks he's someone who can get consumers to buy records at the retail level rather than just picking up the phone and dialing the number shown on the TV screen. `` We're looking forward to adding to our collection of gold and platinum albums,'' said <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>, Universal president. <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON> is a star in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and various points in between. One <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> record store recently had four different <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON> albums and five different compact discs. `` I can go anywhere,'' he said. `` It's a wonderful feeling. I've made 10 tours of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> We did better business on this 10th tour than any one we've done.'' Singing love ballads and not making drastic changes in style have helped him do well, he said. `` I've stayed in the style and never tried to conform to convention. I've sung the kind of songs I write even when out of vogue. Fifteen percent of the record-buying public buy my kind of music. I've stayed faithful to that core of people. `` Every once in a while a song comes along that every one takes to, like ` The Last Farewell,''' he said. He described `` The Last Farewell'' as `` a happy marriage of lyrics and melody.'' `` It was number one in places like <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> where they do n't speak English,'' said <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON> `` They still play it in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, so the tune must have a lot to do with its success. The English-speaking nations identified with the chorus, ` For you are beautiful and I love you dearly.' `` The lyrics were emotive to me and I identified with them.'' In his writing and singing, <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON> looks for songs that express realism. `` If I can relate to what a person is saying, then I sing it. Like ` Downtown' or ` The Last Farewell.' If it reflects something of my own experience, then I sing it.'' <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, now lives in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. He has a degree in biochemistry from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bangor </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>. `` I did become a biochemist,'' he said. `` But I wanted to go into the entertainment business to get it out of my system. The more I got into it, the more I fought to succeed. `` The less I succeeded, the more I fought,'' he said. `` It became a real mania for me. My father threatened me about getting the right job. When I finally found success, he came around a bit.'' Apart from his recording and concert tours, his TV special, `` <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, a Musical Safari,'' was shown by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION> on cable TV. He is active in efforts to help save <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s black rhino, donating proceeds from program sales at concerts and recording royalties to a trust fund to create sanctuaries for the rhino in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Sales Up Based on GM Results, But For How Long?</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Auto Sales-Table</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Sales of North American-made cars and trucks rose 12.7 percent in mid-September, based on a strong showing by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, but at least one analyst wondered how long it could go on. The eight major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers said Monday they sold cars and light trucks at an average daily rate of 37,948 during the Sept. 11-20 period this year, compared with a rate of 33,670 during the same time last year. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> buyers propelled the company's truck sales up 46 percent and car sales by 11.2 percent. Combined, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s vehicle sales were up 21.7 percent during the period this year over last year. `` They had incentives that were closing, that had been scheduled to end this week and a lot of dealer incentives,'' said analyst <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Glantz </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The dealer incentives, which manufacturers give to their retailers to use as they please, have helped move cars and trucks, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Meier </PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION> Ray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` I think, finally, they realized that when you put the money in the dealers' pockets, they're going to sell them,'' he said of the cars on his lot. <PERSON> Meier </PERSON> said an inventory of 35 1989 model vehicles on his lot at the beginning of the month had shrunk to eight by Monday. `` They -LRB- dealers -RRB- asked us to give them money so they could sell in their marketplace,'' said <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. `` At least in the first 20 days -LRB- of September -RRB-, they're proving that may have made some sense. `` We're just having a very strong September,'' he said. But <PERSON> Glantz </PERSON> and other analysts have said for weeks that the boom that has gone on during the past several sales periods may stem from incentives and reports of price increases on 1990 models that are pushing consumers into buy-now thinking. `` The industry has an above average amount of inventory, there are unprecedented incentives and a whopping price increase for the 1990s,'' <PERSON> Glantz </PERSON> said. `` -LRB- Sales -RRB- are going to fall off a cliff in October.'' So far this year, car and truck sales by the eight manufacturers are down 1.5 percent compared to the same 1988 period. A 0.4 percent increase in truck sales was more than offset by a 2.6 percent decline in car sales. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> already have begun offering incentives on their 1990 models, sometimes even before the vehicles officially go on sale. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is expected to jump into the incentive fray. Dealers have worried that consumers are getting so conditioned to incentives that cars and trucks must have them in order to be attractive. <PERSON> Meier </PERSON> was bullish on the future of the industry. `` The -LRB- 1990 -RRB- price increases are one thing, but when people come out and see what they are getting and with the incentives, there is n't that much different,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said sales of its cars and light trucks were up 3.4 percent in mid-September over last year. Car sales were up 2.6 percent and truck sales rose 4.5 percent. For the year, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s vehicle sales were down 0.7 percent. Car and truck sales at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> were up 0.7 percent in mid-September. Car sales were up 2.1 percent and truck sales were down 0.7 percent. For the year, vehicle sales at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> were running 5.9 percent behind last year's pace. For the year, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> has sold 3.9 percent fewer vehicles than it did through Sept. 20, 1988.

 Here are sales results for the eight major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers for second period of September 1989.

<HEAD>Britain's Trade Deficit Falls, But Still Wider Than Forecast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s merchandise trade deficit eased to $ 3.69 billion in August from a revised shortfall of $ 3.99 billion the previous month, but it was still the fourth-largest gap ever, the government said Tuesday. The Central Statistical Office said the deficit of the current account, which includes services and overseas investments, was $ 3.20 billion, the third largest ever, but down from July's revised deficit of $ 3.50 billion. The pound and stock prices fell sharply on the news. The government said August's figures, like that of the previous month's, could have been distorted by a three-week strike by dock workers at some British ports which disrupted trade flows this summer. Exports totaled $ 12.04 billion in August, down from $ 12.39 billion in July and up from $ 11.01 billion dollars -RRB- in August 1988. Imports totaled $ 15.72 billion in August, down from $ 16.40 billion in July and up from $ 13.68 billion in August 1988. Since the beginning of 1989, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s merchandise trade balance has been in deficit by $ 26.79 billion, compared with a deficit of $ 20.73 billion a year earlier. The current account has been in deficit by $ 22.33 billion so far this year, compared with a gap of $ 13.74 billion a year earlier.

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is taking aim at alleged price-gouging among a new crop of telephone companies that serve the traveling public. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, on a voice vote Monday, passed a bill that would regulate prices and require extensive disclosure to callers using any of the more than 35 alternative-operator companies which have sprung up in the wake of the 1984 breakup of the Bell System. The bill would require the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to investigate the industry's charges and determine if such companies dominate the market enough to require regulation. A companion bill is pending in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The companies would have to file their prices with the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> within 30 days and, if the commission finds them `` unjust or unreasonable,'' the companies would have to justify the rates, which can be far greater than the fees for similar calls from customers' homes. Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., said the legislation was designed to `` protect consumers from price-gouging'' by `` fast-buck artists'' without jeopardizing the future of the operator services industry One caller told the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> he was charged $ 27.53 for a 27-minute call from a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> hotel to <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> using an AT & amp; T calling card. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T would have normally charged $ 4.60. The measure also would order the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> to extend to the entire operator services industry disclosure requirements imposed on five of the companies in February. There are more than 35 operator services companies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> providing approximately 5 percent of the $ 12 billion market for `` dial-0'' services such as credit card, third party billing and collect calls. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> does not regulate these companies' rates because the commission says they do n't dominate the market. But critics say they do dominate in places, such as schools, hotels and airports, where they often control all long-distance calls.

 Consumer, labor and government watchdog groups announced today their opposition to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan to cut the capital gains tax, saying it would be a windfall for high-income taxpayers. `` Capital gains proponents are asking Americans to ignore the unjustified financial windfall this tax break will provide to individuals who need it the least,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cause </ORGANIZATION>, a self-styled citizens lobby involved in government ethics isssues. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is once again hearing the claim that there is nothing wrong with the economy that a tax cut for people with incomes over $ 200,000 wo n't cure,'' said <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Claybrook </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> organization. `` The vote is a critical test of whether the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is truly a representative body _ or whether it is a captive of big money lobbyists and the wealthy,'' she said. That vote could come as early as Wednesday. `` If <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approves of this new tax break, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may find it hard to explain to working people back home why they voted for yet another bargain with high-income taxpayers,'' said a statement by the <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislation </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> group. The groups held a news conference in the Capitol as the battle over the capital gains tax moved to the airwaves, with Republicans and Democrats advertising for popular support on an issue that is dividing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> sharply along partisan lines. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to raid the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> by reducing capital gains taxes for the superrich and he wants working Americans to pay for it,'' <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., argues in a television spot produced by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` Why are foreign economies growing faster than the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>? One big reason is taxes,'' says a Republican ad that pictures an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag slipping behind flags from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. `` We have one of the world's highest capital gains taxes,'' it says, while the comparable taxes in those other countries are miniscule. The parties were buying time for the ads in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where the target will be the votes of a few mostly conservative Democrats who could decide the outcome when the House votes. It is the biggest test for the new <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leadership under Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and for a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> strategy that seeks to weaken the majority leadership by courting conservative Democrats. The Republicans say Democrats, by fighting the Bush-supported plan to cut the maximum capital gains rate from 33 percent to 19.6 percent over the next 27 months, are attached to a `` tax and spend'' philosophy. The Democratic alternative would raise marginal tax rates on the wealthy to the same 33 percent paid in the bracket that covers the upper-middle-income. That revenue would then be used to restore tax breaks for Individual Retirement Accounts. The Democratic plan also includes a capital gains cut _ to 28 percent, so it would not cut the marginal rate paid by the most wealthy. `` It's clearly a reconfirmation that they want to raise taxes,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said Monday. `` Who's going to believe they want to stop there?'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> denounced <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>'s comments as `` stuff and nonsense.'' The Democrats oppose the Bush-backed plan because it is `` ill timed, ill considered and damaging ... helping only the richest of our citizens and unfair to the middle class,'' he said. The capital gains tax cut is part of a huge budget bill before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. The package would be contentious even without the tax fight, because it also contains changes in the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> catastrophic health coverage plan, new federal child care programs, and dozens of other issues with divided support. Nearly buried beneath the controversial issues is the bill's underlying purpose, which is reducing the federal deficit Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON>, D-Minn., said a review of the bill showed that much of the deficit-reduction in the package was `` disingenuous,'' and after three years the bill would be adding to the red ink Still, <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON> said he would probably vote for the bill if it includes the GOP-supported capital gains tax cut. He did n't put that in the `` disingenuous'' category, but included figures showing that it, too, would begin adding billions of dollars to the deficit after an initial period of added revenues.

 The stock market was higher in moderate trading today as investors searched for bargains following Monday's sell-off The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 17.29 points to 2,676.48 at 11 a.m. EDT. The blue-chip indicator was 8.55 points higher an hour earlier after dropping 22.42 points on Monday.

Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 47.63 million shares. The stock market got a slight boost early in the day from a government report that showed surprising strength in new factory orders for durable goods. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that factory orders for `` big ticket'' durable items such as cars, airplanes and machinery, rose 3.8 percent in August, the biggest advance this year. However, the July data was revised downward from down 2.2 percent to down 2.5 percent, more than expected. Orders in June had risen 1.3 percent. Moreover, a closely-watched section of the report showed that non-defense capital goods had dropped 9.8 percent to $ 37.4 billion. Economists use this category as a barometer of business investment plans. `` What we're seeing is a bargain-hunting phase helped along by program trading,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>.

 A subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Whittaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and two former executives pleaded guilty today to charges they bribed a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> contracting official to increase the value of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> electronic contracts their company obtained. <ORGANIZATION> Whittaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the government and two counts of bribing former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> with nearly $ 75,000 between 1982 and 1988. The <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON> subsidiary agreed to pay $ 3.5 million in fines, civil penalties and reimbursement for the cost of the investigation. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamberth </PERSON>, 59, the former head of the subsidiary, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Tassel </PERSON>, ex-director of operations at its <LOCATION> Fayetteville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, facility, also entered guilty pleas before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON>. The plea by the <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON> subsidiary is the third by a corporation since the investigation began last year. <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hazeltine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> have both entered guilty pleas for their roles in the procurement scandal. According to court papers, officials of <ORGANIZATION> Whittaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> were unaware of the bribery scheme, which began before the company acquired the subsidiary in 1986. The bribery scheme allegedly began in 1982 when the company was known as <ORGANIZATION> Lee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> and continued two years after its acquisition by <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lamberth </PERSON> was a stockholder of the company and became head of the subsidiary following its acquisition by <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON>. Court papers said <PERSON> Lamberth </PERSON> hid the scheme from Whittaker officials. The bribes allegedly were funneled to <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> through defense consultants <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Marlowe </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Illeman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marlowe </PERSON> is cooperating with the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s continuing investigation of Pentagon procurement fraud dubbed `` Operation Ill Wind.'' <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Illeman </PERSON> have not been charged. <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, who pleaded guilty to taking bribes from <PERSON> Marlowe </PERSON> as part of an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> undercover sting, signed authorizations that greatly enhanced the value of two contracts the company obtained to help the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> develop a battlefield air traffic control system, court papers said. <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> signed papers increasing the value of one contract from $ 600,000 to $ 2.5 million, according to the papers, and also authorized the enhancement of another contract's value from $ 540,000 to $ 3.6 million. He also authorized the transfer to <ORGANIZATION> Lee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> of another contract worth $ 1.6 million when the company that first obtained the deal had difficulty developing software, the court papers said. <PERSON> Lamberth </PERSON> faced a possible 20-year sentence and fines up to $ 500,000 for his guilty pleas to conspiracy and bribery. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Tassel </PERSON> could be sentenced to up to 15 years and fined $ 250,000 for his bribery plea. <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> scheduled a Dec. 15 sentencing proceeding for both defendants, who have agreed to cooperate with the investigation.

 <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> says it is in buyout talks and published reports indicate <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has offered about $ 3 billion for the film and television production company. In a statement today, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> said its board met Monday night to review its discussions about a possible sale of the company and adjourned the meeting until Wednesday, when it expects `` further action will be taken.'' In active trading early today on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> was down 25 cents a share at $ 26.12 -LCB-. It had risen $ 5.25 a share on Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> declined comment today on the reports that it had received a buyout offer from <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>, which previously had indicated an interest in buying a movie studio. A <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> spokesman failed to return a telephone call immediately today, but the company declined coment on Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the Atlanta-based soft drink maker that owns 49 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s stock, said Monday it was aware <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> was in talks and would consider whatever recommendation may be made, but declined further comment. <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> triggered a sharp runup in its stock price Monday when it announced that it was `` in discussions with a third party involving the acquisition for cash of all of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s outstanding shares.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, citing unnamed entertainment industry sources, said <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> had offered to buy <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> for $ 26 to $ 28 a share. With 112.7 million shares outstanding, that would value <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> at $ 2.93 billion to $ 3.15 billion. It also has about $ 1.3 billion in long-term debt outstanding. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Tuesday editions that <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> made an offer of $ 3.4 billion cash, attributing it to an unidentified source. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s board was expected to accept the bid, possibly as soon as Wednesday. Foreign companies have shown a ravenous appetite for U.S.-made films and TV programming in recent months as cable and satellite channels have opened up in European and <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> markets. Less than two weeks ago, for instance, <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> accepted a $ 1.5 billion buyout bid from the <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, also based in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, had offered $ 1.4 billion for <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> said it had active buyout discussions with <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> in late 1988. Analysts say <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>, which bought <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> for $ 2 billion in January 1988, is eager to own entertainment `` software'' such as movies and TV shows as a complement to the hardware such as VCRs and television sets it has been making for years. `` There are only a limited supply of companies like this,'' analyst <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Logsdon </PERSON> said of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. He follows the entertainment business for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Crowell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weedon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> operates two movie studios, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tri-Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>, and has a library of more than 2,700 film titles and more than 260 TV series. Recent movie releases from <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> have included `` Ghostbusters II,'' `` The Karate Kid Part III,'' and `` When <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Met </PERSON> <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> ...'' while Tri-Star has come out with `` See No Evil, Hear No Evil'' and `` Lock Up.'' <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> is one of the leading suppliers of TV programming through its <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> Enterprises units. <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> produces or distributes 11 TV series that are being aired in prime time, including `` Who's The Boss,'' `` Designing Women'' and `` Married ... with Children.'' <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> also owns <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> <PERSON> Enterprises </PERSON>, whose shows include `` Wheel of Fortune'' and `` Jeopardy,'' the two highest-rated syndicated shows on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television. In addition, the company owns <ORGANIZATION> Loews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theatre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the leading motion picture chains with 820 screens in 220 locations as of the close of its fiscal year, which ended Feb. 28. <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 16 million, or 14 cents a share, on revenue of $ 1.62 billion in the fiscal year.

 Japanese and West German central banks today intervened in currency markets for the second consecutive day, driving down the value of the dollar in an effort to reduce the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. The intervention followed broader action on Monday when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> joined the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> and West German <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> in concerted dollar selling. The actions are in line with a weekend statement by the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> industrial countries _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> _ expressing displeasure with the dollar's strength and fear that its rise in recent months could blunt improvement in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. A strong dollar hurts the trade gap by making <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods more expensive on foreign markets, while lowering the price of imports to American consumers. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar today fell 0.15 yen to a closing 142.80 Japanese yen. It was quoted at the same level later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency was worth 1.9035 West German marks in early trading. On Friday, before the <ORGANIZATION> G-7 </ORGANIZATION> meeting, the dollar bought 146 yen and 1.95 marks. Meanwhile, the world's financial officials began meetings today of the 152-nation <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and its sister lending organization, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. Delegates to the meeting are discussing a range of topics from the deterioration of the environment in developing countries, the Third World's crushing $ 1.3 trillion debt burden, and the movement of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and Hungry from communism to free-market economies. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON>, managing director of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>, pushed today for a doubling of the fund's resources from the current $ 120 billion, but ran into resistance from <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has veto power over the matter. `` The fund has to be of credible size, so that it gives confidence to the membership and to financial markets that it could respond adequately to any unexpected shock, such as those of the mid 1970s and early 1980s,'' he said. On Third World debt, <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> called on private banks to step up their lending to developing countries, even as they are forced to write off old debt as part of Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s debt strategy. `` It is now vital to establish the necessary conditions to bring about a more appropriate contribution from the private sector,'' he said. World Bank President <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> said economic development must be coupled with new efforts to preserve the environment in Third World countries. `` It will be impossible to improve the quality of life ... unless we do much more to conserve our global environment,'' he said, singling out a reduction in carbon monoxide emissions, which contribute to global warming, as a goal. He also said the Third World, which spends $ 200 billion a year on defense, more than its combined expenditure on health and education, must devote fewer resources to the military if it expects to prosper. `` Developing countries on one side, and their arms suppliers and creditors on the other, must adapt to a world where budgets are tight,'' he said. `` ... In evaluating their military expenditures, governments should be realistic, but they also should remember the human consequences of these choices.'' On Monday, officials attending the meetings expressed satisfaction with the results of the intervention. French Finance Minister <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Beregovoy </PERSON> told reporters it reflected `` the reassertion of our common will to cooperate in monetary terms.'' <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Poehl </PERSON> said a decline in the dollar was `` appropriate and reasonable'' and pronounced the action by central banks `` obviously quite successful.'' On other fronts Monday: _ <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> pushed for expansion of his Third World debt strategy, announced in March, which has so far produced tentative agreements between creditor banks and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> `` Important progress is being made within the strengthened debt strategy. We must now push ahead to ensure that the benefits of the strategy reach a broad range of countries,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which met Monday in preparation for today's meeting of the boards of governors of the two world lending organizations. _ <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryrie </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>, an arm of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, offered Polish Finance Minister <PERSON> Leszek </PERSON> <PERSON> Balcerowicz </PERSON> help in setting up a new financial system <PERSON> Ryrie </PERSON> said the efforts are centering on creating a new banking system. He said `` two or three'' Western European banks, which he declined to name, have already expressed an interest.

 The stock market was higher in moderate trading today, but had given back some earlier gains. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 15.39 points to 2,674.58 at noon EDT. The blue-chip indicator was up 17.29 points an hour earlier. On Monday it fell 22.42 points.

Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 69.13 million shares.

The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that factory orders for `` big ticket'' durable items such as cars, airplanes and machinery, rose 3.8 percent in August, the biggest advance this year. However, the July data was revised downward from down 2.2 percent to down 2.5 percent, more than expected. Orders in June had risen 1.3 percent. Also, a closely-watched section of the report showed that non-defense capital goods had dropped 9.8 percent to $ 37.4 billion. Economists use this category as a barometer of business investment plans. `` What we're seeing is a bargain-hunting phase helped along by program trading,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 The roar of blast furnaces, the grinding of ore in the crusher room and the rattle of conveyors that have sustained this town for 90 years have come to a halt since the Mexican army closed the Cananea copper mine. Only the sound of birds in the walnut and cottonwood trees of Cananea's central plaza, basketballs bouncing on outdoor courts, dogs barking and popular music drifting on the breeze remain. `` What an ugly silence,'' said <PERSON> Herminia </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Tona </PERSON>, as she and her retired miner husband watched the sunset from the front porch of their home overlooking the open pit of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s largest copper mine. `` The government left us in the street.'' The Cananea mine has been an icon of the Mexican labor movement since 1906, when strikers who survived bloody military repression went on to become leaders of the Mexican Revolution. Mindful of that symbolic background, the government sent the army in on Aug. 20 when it announced the bankruptcy of the 90 percent state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Compania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cananea </ORGANIZATION>. The mine closure threw some 3,000 union mineworkers out of jobs, causing worry in the town of 35,000 whose economy revolves around the mine. `` We do n't know what's going on. We're all uncertain,'' said <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, who has two nephews who worked in the mine. Picking pink roses outside her red brick home, she added, `` Everybody here is affected.'' Sales in local stores have dropped by 90 percent because so many of the towns' breadwinners were put out of work, according to the local chamber of commerce. `` We were selling 2 million pesos -LRB- about $ 800 -RRB- worth a day,'' said pharmacy owner <PERSON> Dina </PERSON> <PERSON> Carillo </PERSON>. `` We are down to 600,000 now. We have to give credit to people and we do n't know if they're going to be able to pay.'' The Cananea mine had been operating in the black, producing 3 percent of the world's copper and 45 percent of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s output, at a cost of 90 cents a pound in times when buyers are paying more than $ 1 a pound for the metal. But the government has been trying to sell the operation to private investors as part of a national privatization effort. State ownership of companies has decreased from 1,222 to 744 since 1982. Two deals to sell the mine fell through last year, and the government is looking for a third chance. Local Section 65 spokesman <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Borjorquez </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miners </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Metallurgical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> and Allied Trades of the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> says the bankruptcy announcement, one week before mineworkers were set to go on strike for collective bargaining contract demands, was a means to break the union and make the operation more attractive to private investors. `` I think the government wants to dress up the bride so she can get married,'' he said. The mineworkers earned $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 per year, plus benefits. The government says their demands amounted to a 330 percent increase in salary and benefits. <PERSON> Nacional </PERSON> <PERSON> Financiera </PERSON>, the government bank and majority shareholder in the mine, called the move `` a painful measure, but the only viable option.'' President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> told labor leaders and lawmakers in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> that all companies privatized under this strategy should be seen as opportunities for worker ownership. Labor Secretary <PERSON> Arsenio </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> subsequently offered miners 25 percent control of the operation. Union rank-and-filer members have talked about assuming ownership responsibilities in the past, but have never made a formal proposal, <PERSON> Borjorquez </PERSON> says. Miners organizing for better pay and conditions in 1906 were brutally put down by Mexican troops and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reinforcements, in one of the first trade union movements in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. More than 20 miners died in the fight and dozens more were imprisoned. Today the `` Martyrs of 1906'' are immortalized in a folk song whose lyrics are emblazoned on a signboard inside the Cananea jail where some of the strikers were detained. This time, when the army came in `` there was not a single case of mistreatment,'' said <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizarde </PERSON>, now in charge of guarding the idled mine facilities. Army helicopters dropped leaflets over the town, announcing the bankruptcy, as 3,000 soldiers were martialed into the mine. `` The government just wanted to be secure,'' said <PERSON> Elizarde </PERSON>. When the troops arrived, Cananea Security Chief <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> and Mayor <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Taddei </PERSON> agreed to order the town's 12 cantinas and all other liquor outlets closed. `` It was a preventive measure,'' <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said. The weekly dances in the town square were called off, too, a measure that upset local youth. `` It's making life hard on us kids,'' said <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Veronica </PERSON> <PERSON> Rojas </PERSON>, who was joined by other high-schoolers in her complaints. The army pulled out after six days, and the union staged a symbolic mine takeover on Aug. 28, the day miners had set to strike for contract renegotiation demands before the bankruptcy declaration. The company's bankruptcy administrator, <ORGANIZATION> Financiero </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Azucarera </ORGANIZATION>, has said the miners will get severance pay set by federal labor law, although their contract calls for six times as much. The miners have refused to accept severance pay and appealed the bankruptcy decision, demanding that the mine be reopened, their contract observed and that contract negotiations be taken up. Unions, organizations and individuals in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have sent food and clothing to Cananea to help the mineworkers and their families. The government and the <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> have also sent provisions. Union leaders and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials are negotiating in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> as bankruptcy administrators settle the details of accounts due and the government debates the future of the sleeping copper giant.

 The face of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s minivans has undergone plastic surgery and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> may not like <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s nose job. Ever since small passenger vans caught the fancy of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> buyers, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> has commanded a dominant share of the market. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> is hoping its long-hooded minivans will compel <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> owners to switch makes. While the auto market as a whole likely will shrink during the next year, there are predictions of continued growth in minivans, a segment which has seen rapid expansion since 1983, when <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> introduced the Dodge Caravan and the <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voyager </ORGANIZATION>. The minivan market actually is older than that. <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> imported a compact van starting in 1950 and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in the early 1960s sold a <ORGANIZATION> Falcon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wagon </ORGANIZATION>, a half-foot shorter than its current Aerostar minivan. Since the minivan's popularity was ignited seven years ago, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> has commanded more than 50 percent of the segment of the light-truck market, which includes minivans. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s share is beginning to slip as the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerostar </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> MPV grow in popularity. The unknown in the minivan formula is how much of the market <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> will get. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> executives have conceded they will lose some of their share, perhaps a percentage point or two. `` But we expected that,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the company's vehicle-making arm. While <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> has slapped big incentives on many of its vehicles, the Voyager and Caravan have been exempt. The patients in <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s plastic surgery are the <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lumina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> APV </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pontiac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sport </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Oldsmobile </PERSON> <PERSON> Silhouette </PERSON>, rakishly styled minivans made at <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tarrytown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, assembly plant. Over the past few months, the company has given plant employees loaner vans to drive around the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> countryside to let folks get an eyeful of the futuristic-looking vehicles. The <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> minivan was originally for the corporation's <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> and Chevrolet divisions, and <PERSON> Oldsmobile </PERSON> was added later, said a source speaking on condition of anonymity. Capacity of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tarrytown </LOCATION> plant is about 200,000 minivans a year and the mix among the three divisions can be changed relatively easily. Like other minivan makers, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> officials expect buyers to come from those looking at sedans and station wagons and, to a smaller extent, minivan owners ready to trade in their vehicles. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> is banking on some of those current minivan buyers being intrigued by the shape of the <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> versions. The plastic-bodied vehicles sport a snout that would have made Cyrano de Bergerac jealous. Analyst <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said he thinks the new <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> minivans are quite attractive. The front-wheel-drive vehicles join the conventionally styled <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astro </ORGANIZATION>, which is being offered in four-wheel drive for 1990, in the assault on <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s hold on the minivan market. All <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s minivans are front-wheel drive. `` It's the biggest threat that <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> minivans have received to date,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. `` There really has n't been anything that would serve as a direct substitute; the others have either been smaller or rear-wheel drive.'' The minivan battle is n't just between <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> continues to offer its Aerostar, and Japanese companies are hoping to grab larger pieces of the minivan pie. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is n't sitting still, either. It is offering a Town & amp; Country version of the minivan, more expensive than the Caravan or Voyager but loaded with extras, including leather seats and a compass. `` We'll sell out two -LRB- minivan -RRB- plants,'' <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON> said, speaking of the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, factories. <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON> estimated the introduction of the <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> minivans will add about 200,000 of the vehicles to the road next year, cutting slightly into <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s share. Those new purchasers, he added, will come primarily from potential station-wagon buyers. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is offering no station wagons for 1990. Sales of minivans last year amounted to 725,081 units, a 21.1 percent increase over the year before. The vehicle's share of the light-truck market has climbed to 13.8 percent last year from 7.4 percent in 1985.

 <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, which is fending off a hostile $ 22 billion bid from <ORGANIZATION> Hoylake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, on Tuesday announced a major restructuring that includes the sale of its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retail operations. BAT said it would reshape itself to concentrate on tobacco and fast-growing financial services. Sir <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>, the Anglo-French financier heading <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION>'s bid, said he welcomed BAT's plan as a `` first step'' to the `` unbundling'' plan he has proposed. He said he would pursue his takeover attempt and said the bidding group for BAT would vote in favor of the restructuring. The British conglomerate said it would sell its retailing interests in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which include <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>'s stores, as well as other smaller businesses. It said it would create two new publicly held companies by giving its existing shareholders shares in its British retailing company <ORGANIZATION> Argos </ORGANIZATION>, as well as shares in a combination of its paper companies <ORGANIZATION> Wiggins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teape </ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>. BAT also plans to buy back 10 percent of its shares and to `` significantly increase'' its dividend for 1989. These measures require shareholder approval, and BAT has called a special shareholders meeting for Oct. 19. The <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> bidding group has offered $ 14.14 worth of securities for each BAT share. <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> has suspended the offer while <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> state insurance commissions review its proposed change of ownership of <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> has vowed to `` unbundle'' BAT by selling off all its non-tobacco interests <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> and other critics of BAT have complained that BAT's share price does n't reflect the true value of its underlying businesses and is constrained by the relatively slow growth of its tobacco businesses Now BAT is seeking to fight off the <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> bid by addressing this problem. The <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> offer, however, has attracted little interest from BAT's shareholders and analysts have said that the bidders will have to increase their offer and include some cash in order to succeed. `` We can now accelerate the strategy of concentrating on financial services and tobacco,'' BAT Chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> said in a statement. `` The board now believes that the five decisive steps will continue the long-term development of the group and address our concern about the value of BAT shares on the stock market compared to the underlying value of the businesses.'' BAT said it envisions that tobacco will provide steady earnings growth and strong cash flow which will complement the more rapid growth expected in financial services during the 1990s. These two businesses will represent `` an exceptionally powerful combination'' to enhance shareholder value in the years ahead, it said. BAT said tobacco and financial services now contribute about $ 1.5 billion and $ 13.36 billion, respectively, to its earnings. BAT forecast pre-tax profit of $ 3.2 billion this year, a 22 percent increase over 1988. Earnings per share also were forecast to rise by 22 percent to $ 1.23.

 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers scrambled on Tuesday to patch together an agreement on their production plans for the rest of the year. The ministers of the 13-nation <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> gathered in late morning but postponed an early evening meeting to give them more time to come up with a new accord. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> announced the delay, saying `` new thinking -LRB- was -RRB- being developed.'' Shortly before then, an Iranian delegate said his country had offered a new plan for raising the production ceiling in the final quarter of the year. The ministers were arguing over whether they can boost production from their current limit of 19.5 million barrels a day in the final quarter, without upsetting prices. `` It seems -LRB- there will be -RRB- a little increase,'' said a senior member of one delegation, who demanded anonymity. `` But we still have different positions,'' he said. `` It's a slow process.'' `` We have to argue a little,'' said <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalifa </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sabah </PERSON> after the two-hour meeting. `` Otherwise, it would n't be <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>.'' The ministers seemed determined to try to rescue the talks, which were on the verge of collapse Monday evening. `` We have come back from the edge of the precipice,'' said a senior delegate midway through the two-hour long morning meeting. He also demanded anonymity. The ministers were reported close to a deal Monday on raising the production ceiling, but then hit some snags forcing them to postpone formal discussions. Their negotiations _ most taking place in their rooms at a luxury <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> hotel _ have centered on a lifting the ceiling between 20 million barrels a day and 21 million barrels, according to delegates. They also must decide how to distribute any increase among the 13 member nations. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> want bigger shares than now allotted them. Others argue the extra amount should be shared proportionately. Late Monday evening, <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> said, `` We think that -LRB- Tuesday -RRB- could be our last look at the routes to take.'' <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> has predicted demand for the cartel's oil would reach 22 million barrels a day in the October-December period. The cartel's executive body, according to sources, has said prices could reach $ 18 even if the cap were lifted to as much as 21.5 million barrels a day _ but only if all adhered to their quotas. The talks, which began Saturday, are officially held by a monitoring panel made up of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. The other members _ <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> _ were invited to attend.

 The cosmetics industry must have the option of testing its products on animals while trying to develop alternative methods to ensure those products are safe for consumers, an industry spokesman said Tuesday. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kavanaugh </PERSON>, president of the Cosmetic, Toiletry and <ORGANIZATION> Fragrance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the industry regards `` the safety of -LRB- its -RRB- consumers as their primary responsibility and highest priority.'' Responding to efforts to ban the use of animals in such product testing, <PERSON> Kavanaugh </PERSON> said the industry is trying to develop alternatives. However, `` makers of personal care products must continue to have the option of using animal research data,'' he said. Animal rights activists who gathered outside the industry news conference argued that alternatives already have been found and are being used. `` Major corporations ... have switched to in vitro or non-animal methods, including cell-culture techniques, testing on membranes, computer modeling,'' <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> of People for the <ORGANIZATION> Ethical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animals </ORGANIZATION> told reporters. The nation's largest cosmetics company, <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION>, has invested millions of dollars to develop such non-animal testing alternatives, company spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. However, <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Avons </PERSON> backs the industry association position on testing because `` there is no one test or even a series of tests that could be developed for everybody's products.'' `` Until everybody has developed alternatives, we feel they ought to have the option of testing,'' he said. Eight states _ <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> _ are considering legislation to ban animal testing for cosmetics, household and pharmaceutical products.

<HEAD>Lessons In Capitalism for New Breed Of East Bloc Managers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With much of the communist world planning economic retooling, lessons in capitalism await at the first business administration schools designed to turn a new breed of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc managers into competitive, market-oriented executives. A fundamentally different business environment is developing as economically weak <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and increasingly troubled <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> cut restraints on domestic entrepreneurs, demand that state-run enterprises be profitable and open their borders to foreign investors. A handful of executive training programs are being organized to meld Western management techniques with the realities of Eastern European business. `` Intellectually, these are not new concepts,'' says <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Kosminski </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor creating the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> to open Oct. 23 near the capital. `` But let's say that in our system of management, there was no use up to now for that kind of approach ... because of a system that was obviously in basic contradiction to sound business practices.'' <PERSON> Kosminski </PERSON>'s school will offer the first <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc equivalent of a Master's of Business Administration. In addition, Western companies are opening business skills schools in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. During more than four decades of centralized planning for captive consumers in communist-ruled nations, business decisions were made by remote bureaucratic ministries. There was litle need to worry about developing hot-selling products, finding market niches, advertising and packaging. Motivating workers, pleasing customers, direct foreign trade and cost saving largely are new concepts for the would-be East bloc entrepreneur. `` Our business people are used to thinking in socialist conditions: ` I produce because I must cover the social need.' This is nonsense,'' said <PERSON> Bogda </PERSON> <PERSON> Zukowska </PERSON>, a journalist for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Economic Life newspaper `` Now they are starting to think, ` I must produce because I would like to sell and earn money, and I must do my best to cope with the market, what the market needs and the cost of production,''' she said. Hopes for resurrecting <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economy hinge largely on foreign investment and domestic private enterprise. But Poles must learn how the West does business when there is competition for customers who have a range of choices, and foreign investors must learn how business works in what <PERSON> Kosminski </PERSON> calls <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s `` negotiable'' economy. At the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, 48 Polish business people, some private entrepreneurs and others sent by their state-owned enterprises, have signed up for the first semester at a cost of about $ 250. The school also will offer orientation programs for Western managers interested in doing business in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc and offer consulting services from students who are doing case studies. In <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> was established in November 1988 through a joint venture with Italian organizations. A 10-month `` junior executive'' program is offered along with lecture series for managers. A Canadian-Polish partnership is starting the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> this fall, offering programs for executives and courses on `` English for business'' and `` How to start your own business.'' Polish regulations on starting private businesses were loosened this year under a privatization of enterprises considered crucial for turning the economy toward capitalism, filling empty stores and reviving commercial links with the West. Before these new businesses _ and those being salvaged from the socialist sector _ can enter the competitive market abroad or prosper at home, the entrepreneurs will need new techniques, <PERSON> Kosminski </PERSON> said. The classes at his school are `` designed to train the elite of Polish managers as efficient, market oriented and globally oriented, socially responsible, competent and reliable business partners,'' according to a prospectus. Polish professors and visiting lecturers will offer courses in Polish and English _ materials on such subjects as international marketing and finance are virtually unavailable in Polish _ to be held one week a month through four semesters over two years so participants can continue to work. Students will learn accounting, business law and quality control, as well as business protocol, how to organize receptions and what to say in press releases. `` They will combine a knowledge of international business and international standards of doing business with local specificity,'' <PERSON> Kosminski </PERSON> said. Polish managers also will be needed to help Western executives investing in the country maneuver through logistical and bureaucratic obstacles. `` Our business environment is still exotic,'' <PERSON> Kosminski </PERSON> said, with multiple currency markets, supplies from typing paper to office chairs virtually unavailable and an endless string of `` arrangements'' needed to handle the `` negotiable'' bureaucracy. `` It is difficult for foreign businesses,'' he said. `` That's why they need intermediaries, people who know both cultures, and I think some of our graduates might be able to play that role.

<TEXT>
 Wheat futures prices moved higher, while soybeans prices tumbled and corn futures were mostly lower at the close Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. A forecast of ideal harvest weather was depressing corn and soybeans at the start of the day, analysts said, then professional fund buying pushed prices higher. But the rally did n't hold and prices declined toward the end of the session. <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said a lack of any real export demand for soybeans was weighing on futures prices. Wheat prices, however, were supported by Monday's announcement from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> of a sale to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> of 300,000 metric tons of the commodity and anticipation of more export business this week, traders said.

 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Tuesday revealed ambitious plans for <ORGANIZATION> Micro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Architecture </ORGANIZATION>, its patent-covered design for the way information moves around inside its personal computers <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> also said that Micro Channel is theoretically capable of transferring data at 160 million bytes per second, eight times as fast as its current speed limit. A byte represents one letter or number. The announcements were intended in part to counter the momentum of a standard that is being pushed by the `` Gang of Nine'' _ rival makers of personal computers such as <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> recently said it will begin shipping the first computer built to that rival standard in October <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said it intends to use Micro Channel not only with personal computers, but eventually with high-speed workstations and even mainframe computers _ a landmark in the growing importance of personal computers. Although <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s mainframe line uses a different system for internal data transfer, the company said <ORGANIZATION> Micro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION> would eventually become the way that mainframes communicate with personal computers and workstations. As a sign of the Micro Channel's importance, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said the design would form the heart of a new line of workstations that will replace the relatively unsuccessful RT PC late this year or early in 1990. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> has tried to make Micro Channel into an industry standard, but companies that have come out with compatible machines under license to <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> have had limited success. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> is hoping that Tuesday's announcements will convince customers that Micro Channel, announced in 1987, is the wave of the future. `` They're trying to show a sense of order in a potentially chaotic environment,'' said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Albert </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> executive who is now a consultant in <LOCATION> Scarsdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s rivals say their personal computer standard is better because there are more add-on devices that will work with it. But <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said there are more than 1,000 add-on devices made by other companies to enhance the <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> Personal System-2, and more in the works. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> both said Tuesday they were working with <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> on developing sets of chips that other companies could use to make compatible add-on devices for the Micro Channel. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> reaffirmed that it would come out with a personal computer built on <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s latest microprocessor, the high-speed i486, by the end of the year. It cut prices and introduced new variations on several existing models in its Personal System-2 line.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday proposed the sale of its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retailing businesses as part of a restructuring the conglomerate hoped would defeat <ORGANIZATION> Hoylake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 22 billion hostile takeover bid. The planned restructuring was intended to enhance the value of <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION>'s stock, company chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> said in a statement. Sir <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Anglo-French </LOCATION> financier who leads <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION>, said he welcomed BAT's proposal as a first step toward his plans for breaking up the conglomerate. <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> said he would not give up his takeover attempt, which has been suspended while the group tries to overcome regulatory obstacles. Securities analysts said BAT's proposals would enhance the value of the British conglomerate's stock and was likely to be approved by its shareholders. But they said <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> could still bid for what is left of BAT. <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> has offered 13.4 billion pounds, or $ 22 billion, in securities for BAT. BAT said it would reshape itself to concentrate on its tobacco business, which is steady and generates cash, and its fast-growing financial services segment. This would be a significant departure from its previous strategy of gradually diversifying away from tobacco. The retained businesses are expected to account for 80 percent of <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION>'s forecast 1989 pre-tax profit of $ 3.2 billion, BAT said. The British conglomerate said it would sell its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retailing business, which includes 46 <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> Fifth Avenue stores and 24 <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Field </ORGANIZATION>'s stores. The two retailers have combined annual sales of $ 2 billion. These and other planned, smaller divestitures could fetch a total of $ 2.4 billion, analysts said. BAT said it also would create two new publicly held companies by giving its existing shareholders a stake in its British retailing company <ORGANIZATION> Argos </ORGANIZATION>, as well as stock in a combination of its paper companies, <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON> <PERSON> Teape </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION> is based in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. BAT said it also would buy back 10 percent of its shares _ which would cost 1.24 billion pounds, or $ 2 billion, at Tuesday's closing price on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The company also pledged to significantly increase its dividends. The total dividend for 1989 could go as high as 30 pence, or 48 cents, per share, a 49 percent increase over the previous year's payment, BAT said. BAT called a special shareholders meeting for Oct. 19 to vote on the proposed restructuring. BAT stock rose 2 pence, or 3 cents, a share to close at 818 pence, or $ 13.17. <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> has suspended its $ 14.14 a share offer while state insurance commissioners in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> review its proposed change of ownership of <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> has vowed to break up BAT by selling off all its non-tobacco interests The group and other critics of BAT have complained the conglomerate's stock price does not reflect the true value of its underlying businesses because it is constrained by the relatively slow growth of its tobacco business. <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON>, in an interview on British radio, said the plan would give existing shareholders the benefit of splitting up BAT, rather than allowing <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> to take a profit from dismantling the conglomerate. <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> would vote in favor of <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION>'s plan although the investor group was not abandoning its bid. `` The point is that they've made a first step'' in the direction of realizing a higher share value for BAT shareholders, which is the basis of the <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> argument, <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. The <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> offer has attracted little interest from BAT's shareholders and analysts have said that the bidding group would have to increase its bid and include some cash to succeed <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, an analyst with the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` It does seem likely that they -LRB- shareholders -RRB- would approve these -LRB- BAT -RRB- proposals because it gives them a bird in the hand.'' It could take <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> nine months to get regulatory clearance in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he said. `` It's a useful start,'' said <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Utley </PERSON>, an analyst with <PERSON> Laing </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cruickshank </PERSON>. `` It will enhance shareholder value, but not necessarily enough to defeat a serious bid.''

<HEAD>Executive Gets 18 Months in Mail Fraud Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Wall Street executive who pleaded guilty to three counts of mail fraud for for allegedly bribing a former governor of <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> has been sentenced to 18 months in prison. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> on Monday also placed <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Abba </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> on five years' probation, fined him $ 100,000 and ordered him to repay the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> $ 300,000. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> bond underwriting firm of <ORGANIZATION> Matthews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, pleaded guilty July 14 to three counts of mail fraud. He had been accused of funneling $ 70,000 to former Guam Gov. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bordallo </PERSON>'s unsuccessful 1986 re-election campaign. In exchange, <PERSON> Bordallo </PERSON> allegedly agreed to generate support for a $ 300 million housing bond issue underwritten by <ORGANIZATION> Matthews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bordallo </PERSON> was acquitted in February 1986 of accepting bribes from <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> but was convicted on 10 counts of government corruption. He served as governor from 1975-79 and from 1983-87. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> had faced a maximum 15 years' imprisonment and a $ 750,000 fine in addition to restitution payments, according to <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney from <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION>. The three counts referred to money bilked from the Guam Program Development Fund and a `` lulling letter'' assuring fund authorities that the transactions were legal. A December 1987 indictment charged <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> with preparing phony invoices that were sent to the bank entrusted with the fund money. The bank paid the money to <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, who spent $ 25,000 to buy campaign paraphernalia _ including parasols, shirts and hats _ for <PERSON> Bordallo </PERSON>'s unsuccessful re-election bid, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> has said. Authorities said <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> made his contributions after <PERSON> Bordallo </PERSON> was promised that he would receive campaign contributions if he supported the bond issue to build homes. The bond was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Guam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> in 1985. <ORGANIZATION> Matthews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has denied any wrongdoing. In exchange for <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>'s guilty pleas, 46 other counts alleging bribery, conspiracy, and wire and mail fraud were dismissed. The case was moved from <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION>, 3,800 miles west of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, because of extensive pretrial publicity on the island.

 The stock market finished higher today, but fizzled badly in the last hour of trading giving up most of the day's gains. The market opened strong in response to a government report that showed surprising strength in new factory orders for durable goods. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that factory orders for `` big ticket'' durable items such as cars, airplanes and machinery, rose 3.8 percent in August, the biggest advance this year. The market had expected a slight decline. `` The market did mainly what it has been doing the last few weeks - following interest rates,'' said <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> <PERSON> Hays </PERSON>, equities analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> W. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baird </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. On Monday, the stock and bond markets fell as the dollar plunged with central banks intervening to push the currency lower, and interest rates `` Interest rates were up yesterday. Today the pressure is off,'' <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> said. The market had recouped most of its losses from Monday, with the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> Industrial Average up more than 21 points at one point in the session, before a sharp pull-back in the final hour of trading. The Dow Jones average had dropped 22.42 points on Monday. Blue-chip issues led the broad-based rally. Entertainment stocks were active after Monday's reports that <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> was in takeover talks with <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Computerized trading strategies and buying by big institutions in the final week of the third quarter helped buoy prices during much of the session. Analysts said that the stock market's ability to show strength without a similar response in the bond market was encouraging. The credit market posted only a slight change after the durable goods report. Nevertheless, Wall Street analysts said the stock market still lacked strong leadership. `` There's no firm conviction,'' said <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Geronimous </PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

 IRAs, curtailed three years ago on grounds they were an ineffective incentive for saving, are being touted anew by Democrats as a way to spur the economy without further enriching the wealthy. The liberalized <ORGANIZATION> Individual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retirement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Account </ORGANIZATION> is being offered as a substitute for the capital-gains tax reduction recommended by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Most of the tax benefit from either party's proposal would go to the rich and near-rich, affecting the wallets of the richest one-tenth of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxpayers. The House is expected to do battle on the issue this week, with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> taking it up next month. The options will be presented as part of a massive bill whose main purpose is to reduce the budget deficit. `` The choices could not be more stark or compelling,'' <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., says about the plan offered by the Democrats White House budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> is equally as sure about the administration proposal. `` The choice is clear,'' he said. On Tuesday, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vowed to continue his fight for a lower capital gains tax even if it prolongs a spending impasse with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and triggers across-the-board program cuts. He also criticized the Democratic alternative as `` unacceptable.'' `` A president has to use the tools at his disposal to accomplish the ends for which he was elected. And I plan to do exactly that,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, speaking to a group of business people in the Oval Office. The administration wants to cut the maximum tax rate on capital gains _ profits from the sale of stocks and other investments _ to 19.6 percent until 1992. The top rate would then be raised to 28 percent permanently and gains caused solely by inflation would be exempted from taxation. The top rate now is 33 percent. The Democrats propose allowing all workers not permitted a full <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> deduction to write off half a contribution up to $ 2,000 a year. The money would not be taxed until withdrawn for retirement, as the down payment on a first home or for college. Although the administration generally favors expanded IRAs, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats added an angle that makes the proposal unacceptable to the White House: financing IRAs by raising taxes on the richest 600,000 couples and individuals. Cutting capital gains or liberalizaing IRAs would represent a major backing away from the 1986 landmark tax overhaul that curtailed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> deductions and eliminated the special rate for capital gains. The staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Taxation estimates that 85.3 percent of the benefit from the the capital-gains reduction, as approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, would go to those with incomes over $ 75,000 a year. Those people file less than 10 percent of all tax returns. Just over 49 percent of the new <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> benefit would be collected by those earning more than $ 75,000, although the withdrawal features would help lower-and middle-income taxpayers. Backers of the capital-gains cut contend it will pay for itself by spurring economic activity. Democrats say it will worsen the deficit after a three-year burst of higher revenues. There is no agreement among economists that either plan would have a lasting effect on the economy. Both plans are being promoted as ways to increase the nation's lagging rate of saving, making more money available for business expansion and job creation so less will have to be borrowed from foreigners Although the capital-gains issue was debated at length in the 1988 presidential campaign and has been the subject of congressional hearings, the notion of expanding IRAs has drawn little attention since they were curtailed, to the chagrin of middle-income workers, in 1986. In writing its landmark tax overhaul, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> concluded that the ultimate goal was the lowest possible individual tax rates. That meant elimination or reduction of various exclusions and deductions, and two of the most important were the capital-gains break and the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> deduction. Rolling back the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> deduction was made easier when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> concluded that the deduction apparently had produced little new saving, that it had simply encouraged taxpayers to transfer money from a non-taxable account into a tax-deferred <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. `` I had testified for IRAs, and it was a big disappointment when evidence indicated they did little to encourage new saving,'' said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> economist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxation </ORGANIZATION>, headed by former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration official <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ture </PERSON>, now says the early evidence was wrong. `` The weight of the evidence is that IRAs have had a substantial positive net effect on personal saving,'' the institute said in a report commissioned by <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION>. At the height of <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> popularity, in 1986, deductions for $ 37.8 billion in contributions were claimed by 15.5 million taxpayers. A year later, with the deduction curtailed, contributions of $ 14.1 billion were deducted on 7.3 million returns. Before 1986, any worker could contribute up to $ 2,000 a year to a tax-deferred <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. The overhaul law restricted deductible IRAs to workers not covered by a company pension and to covered single workers with incomes $ 25,000 or less and couples earning $ 40,000 or less. Single taxpayers with incomes up to $ 35,000 and couples up to $ 50,000 are allowed a partial deduction.

 Central banks sold waves of dollars again Tuesday but got less satisfying results as the dollar declined only slightly overall and actually rose against <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s yen. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> industrial democracies ganged up against the dollar after agreeing last weekend that the dollar's rise in recent months was `` inconsistent with longer run economic fundamentals.'' Tuesday's intervention knocked only a fraction of a percent off the dollar's value, in contrast to Monday's decline of nearly 6 West German pfennigs and 4 Japanese yen. Some traders said the attractiveness of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates might bring investors back to dollar-denominated securities once the central bankers let up. In fact, the dollar ended the day above its lows of the session. `` Maybe the dollar has taken it just a little bit on the chin but it has fought back quite nicely,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Polce </PERSON>, vice president and manager of corporate foreign exchange at <ORGANIZATION> Algemene </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nederland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Dealers agreed that most of the major government banks had sold dollars, but they disagreed on how large the sales were. Some of the dollar's drop against the West German mark came from continued speculation that the West German central bank would raise a key interest rate next month, drawing global investors away from dollars and into marks. In contrast, the dollar rose against the Japanese yen because fewer people expected the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> to raise rates, dealers said. The Group of Seven consists of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar fell 0.15 Japanese yen to a closing 142.80 yen from 142.95 yen at Monday's close. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it fell further to 142.50 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> it rose to 142.35 yen from 142.13 yen on Monday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound rose to $ 1.6215 from $ 1.6080 late Monday despite Tuesday's announcement of a worse-than-expected merchandise trade deficit of 2.29 billion pounds, or $ 3.69 billion, in August. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the pound rose to $ 1.6190 from $ 1.6175 Monday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with Monday's late rates, included: 1.8918 West German marks, down from 1.8990; 1.6415 Swiss francs, down from 1.6480; 1.1756 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1763; 6.4110 French francs, down from 6.4370; and 1,366.9 Italian lire, down from 1,372.9. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday: 1.8885 West German marks, down from 1.9055; 1.6390 Swiss francs, down from 1.6565; 6.3990 French francs, down from 6.4540; 2.1480 Dutch guilders, unchanged; 1,377.00 Italian lire, unchanged; 1.1750 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1776. Gold rose in thin <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trading to a late bid price of $ 367.75 a troy ounce from $ 367 bid late Monday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the metal rose to $ 367.75 bid from $ 366.75 bid late Monday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell 0.33 to a closing bid of $ 367.53. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery fell to $ 368.50 from $ 369.80 on Tuesday. Later, <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold was bid at $ 367.30 an ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $ 368 late Monday. Silver bullion rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 5.31 a troy ounce, up from $ 5.27 bid late Monday. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Comex, silver bullion for current delivery fell to $ 5.263 an ounce from $ 5.283 on Monday.

<TEXT>
 Crude oil futures fluctuated throughout the day Tuesday before closing slightly higher as traders awaited the outcome of negotiations on <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s production limits. `` It opened down on <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> concerns and then it went up on <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> concerns and bounced around during the day on different rumors,'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiedler </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> E.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Man </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said of the crude oil market. The November contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of crude oil, finally closed 7 cents higher at $ 19.53 a 42-gallon barrel in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. In <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> were trying to raise the cartel's production ceiling from its current 19.5 million barrel limit to a level between 20 million barrels a day and 21 million barrels for the rest of 1989 without sending prices skidding. The ministers twice postponed what was expected to be a final round of talks to consider a new Iranian proposal. Negotiations were to resume Wednesday after private bargaining sessions. Iranian Oil Minister <PERSON> Gholamreza </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> said his country had offered a plan to raise the production ceiling in the last quarter of the year. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> suggested hiking the cap to between 20.5 million barrels a day and 21 million barrels. The cartel has been overproducing, pumping more crude than allowed under an output agreement signed in June. Analysts' estimate <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production at about 22 million barrels daily Among refined products traded on the mercantile exchange Tuesday, heating oil for October delivery picked up 0.20 cent to settle at 57.71 cents a gallon. Unleaded gasoline for October delivery fell 1.29 cents to 60.38 cents a gallon amid reports of plentiful supplies.

He said the disparity between <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s production capacity and its market share would indicate four plants could be closed Last week, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> announced it was idling its <LOCATION> Lakewood </LOCATION> plant in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in March, joining recently closed plants in <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>.; <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mo </PERSON>.; and <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> has scheduled some temporary production cuts next month at a half-dozen car and truck plants, lasting a week or two apiece, because of swollen vehicle inventories <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has said it temporarily would halt production at a car and truck plant in early October. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has n't announced any temporary plant closings for October Analyst <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> estimated that fourth quarter production this year would be 10 percent to 15 percent below last year's levels. Production cuts may be hastened by auto dealers, who have said they wo n't be ordering as many 1990 vehicles as they did during the 1989 model year. There have been estimates that dealer orders may fall by as much as 30 percent below last year's levels. Analysts also said recent sales activity, including a 12.7 percent jump in mid-September car and truck purchases reported Monday, supports a theory that current sales are being `` borrowed'' from the fourth quarter, as consumers rush to beat 1990 model year price increases. `` I suspect sales are going to be rather soft in the fourth quarter,'' <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON> said. Softer sales point to lower production, increased layoffs and a higher potential for labor problems in the last three months of the year, as the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> prepares for Big Three contract talks. One <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Tuesday that union officials were n't alarmed but were monitoring production levels and possible layoffs. <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> contracts with each of the Big Three automakers expire Sept. 14, 1990. Preparations for the negotiations, which open next summer, begin in earnest during the first three months of next year. By then, the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> will be looking back on any temporary layoffs and ahead to the closing of the <LOCATION> Lakewood </LOCATION> plant, which will idle about 2,200 workers. `` I think labor relations are going to be very murky in the next few months,'' <PERSON> Kirnan </PERSON> said. In addition to potential layoffs, one question is the kind of style <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Yokich </PERSON>, the new head of the union's <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, will bring to the bargaining table. This June, <PERSON> Yokich </PERSON> succeeded <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ephlin </PERSON>, who retired. Under <PERSON> Ephlin </PERSON>'s leadership, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and the union developed cooperative programs that injected worker participation in some management decisions, but also created the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>'s largest internal political fight in the past 40 years. Dissidents under the `` New Directions'' banner have criticized <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> leadership for eroding workers' rights through joint programs. But New Directions leader <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said he liked <PERSON> Yokich </PERSON>'s sharp criticism of <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s planned <LOCATION> Lakewood </LOCATION> closing <PERSON> Yokich </PERSON> said the move undermines efforts to develop a new relationship between the company and the union.

 The stock market finished slightly higher Tuesday after a strong rally fizzled in the final hour of trading. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials ended with a gain of 4.75 points at 2,663.94, after climbing more than 21 points during the session. On Monday the blue-chip indicator dropped 22.42 points. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a margin of about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 740 issues up, 634 down and 556 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 158.35 million shares, up from 121.13 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 183.925 million shares. The market opened broadly higher, aided by a sharp run-up in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s stock market overnight and an unexpectedly strong <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government report on durable goods. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that factory orders for `` big ticket'' durable items such as cars, airplanes and machinery, rose 3.8 percent in August, the biggest advance this year. The markets had expected a slight decline. `` It shows the economy still has some life to it,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, chief technical analyst with <ORGANIZATION> MKI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Wall Street analysts said that the stock market's ability to show strength without a similar response in the bond market was encouraging The credit market posted only a slight change after the durable goods report. `` Stocks are showing some independence,'' <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON> said. The market had recouped most of its losses from Monday, with the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> Industrial Average up more than 21 points at one point in the session, before a sharp pull-back in the final hour of trading. `` I ca n't tell you why it sold off,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` I do n't know of any news. The market's technical position for a rally was weak. Stocks were rallying on poor volume and it was destined to fade anyway.'' Blue-chip issues led the broad-based rally in fairly thin volume, but finished with gainers and losers mostly even. Entertainment stocks were particularly active after Monday's reports that <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> was in takeover talks with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` There are only three movie studios left, so there's a scarcity value in terms of movie studios,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> Computerized trading strategies and buying by big institutions in the final week of the third quarter helped buoy prices during much of the session, traders said.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vowed Tuesday to continue his fight for a lower capital gains tax even if it prolongs a spending impasse with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and triggers across-the-board program cuts. He also said he would continue to oppose an `` unacceptable'' Democratic alternative for a liberalized Individual Retirement Account deduction. `` A president has to use the tools at his disposal to accomplish the ends for which he was elected. And I plan to do exactly that,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. House Democratic leaders have coupled their plan to expand <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> deductions with a tax increase on weathly Americans and a more modest reduction in the capital gains taxes than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants. The House is expected to vote on the issue later this week. In a letter sent to all members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> later Tuesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reiterated that he would veto the Democratic plan if it reaches his desk. `` No matter how you dress it up, that alternative is a tax increase _ plain and simple,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in the letter. `` That's no alternative, and my response will be equally plain and simple _ veto.'' At an Oval Office meeting with a group of business people whose support for the lower capital gains tax was evident, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` we ought to stand up to the understandable political rhetoric on the other side, rhetoric that we heard all last year and that we're now hearing once again.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked by a reporter if he would be willing to see extensive automatic spending cuts if there is no agreement in the capital gains battle. `` I do n't want that, but I'm not ruling it out,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The administration and some congressional leaders have suggested the fight over the capital gains tax appears to have dimmed chances of reaching a bipartisan spending agreement for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' failure to enact legislation getting the federal deficit to under a $ 110 billion deficit target will trigger across-the-board cuts Oct. 16 in both domestic and defense programs. `` If -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- would go forward and do what we've suggested, we could avoid sequestration -LRB- automatic cuts -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` But I'm not ruling it out. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the business people: `` It's a tough fight. I obviously would welcome all your support, which I hope I have.'' He also said opponents `` simply are wrong'' when they argue that the capital gains cut is a break for the rich. The administration wants to cut the maximum tax rate on capital gains _ profits from the sale of stocks, real estate and other investments _ to 19.6 percent until 1992. The top rate would then be raised to 28 percent permanently and gains caused solely by inflation would be exempted from taxation. The top rate now is 33 percent. The Democrats are proposing allowing all workers not permitted a full <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> deduction to write off half a contribution up to $ 2,000 a year. House Democrats proposed financing IRAs by raising taxes on the richest 600,000 couples and individuals, saying it would be a windfall for high-income taxpayers. Earlier Tuesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s capital gains proposal was attacked by consumer, labor and government watchdog groups. `` Capital gains proponents are asking Americans to ignore the unjustified financial windfall this tax break will provide to individuals who need it the least,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cause </ORGANIZATION>, a self-styled citizens lobby involved in government ethics isssues. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is once again hearing the claim that there is nothing wrong with the economy that a tax cut for people with incomes over $ 200,000 wo n't cure,'' said <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Claybrook </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> organization.

 The surprisingly robust dollar has rebounded to its levels of nearly three years ago, but economists disagree on what if anything should be done to knock it back down. A strong dollar makes imported goods cheaper for American consumers while hurting American exporters by raising the cost of their goods overseas. While some economists applaud the dollar-bashing efforts of the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> industrialized nations, others say the group's attempts to lower the dollar are either inadequate or misguided The debate over the dollar's proper level is n't just academic: the dollar's value affects everything from the trade deficit and inflation to jobs for American factory workers and the price of a bottle of imported wine in <LOCATION> Poughkeepsie </LOCATION>, N.Y. The Group of Seven nations began flooding the market with dollars from their reserves after agreeing Saturday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the dollar's rise in recent months was `` inconsistent with longer run economic fundamentals.'' The central banks knocked the dollar sharply lower Monday, but continued intervention on Tuesday produced only a slight further decline. The dollar actually edged up against the Japanese yen on Tuesday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Those who support attacks on the dollar say the dollar at current levels makes <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> goods too expensive in world markets and will cause the nation's trade deficit to start rising again. That could cost jobs of Americans who work in industries affected by world trade. `` I think it was highly timely that the G-7 finally moved and at least temporarily has been able to sober the markets,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cline </PERSON>, senior economist at the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. But other economists favor leaving the dollar alone, arguing that it is more important to focus on how well the domestic economy is faring. Right now, they say, the economy is doing well. Trying to knock the dollar down by flooding the market with dollars or lowering <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates could reignite inflation, says that school of economists. `` We're walking a very fine line between making sure the economy gets enough juice and appearing to flood the economy with too much fuel,'' said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahan </PERSON>, chief financial economist at <ORGANIZATION> Kleinwort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Setting policy in light of the dollar instead of focusing on economic conditions could throw off that delicate balance, <PERSON> Kahan </PERSON> said. Even those who support dollar sales by the central banks say the tactic wo n't work all by itself, any more than a lion tamer could indefinitely hold hungry lions away from a pile of pork chops. Global investors will keep buying dollars as long as they believe they can get a high rate of return on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investments, such as <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills, factories and real estate. Worldwide currency trading has nearly doubled in the last three years to well over than $ 300 billion a day, enough to swamp intervention by central banks over the long run, <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> said. `` What we have to do is have the dollar come down as a consequence of a reduction in our budget deficit, which would cause lower interest rates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and it would be that mechanism that would bring down the dollar,'' he said. <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> said he favors action to cut the trade deficit because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is in danger of eventually becoming another <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, a debtor nation forced to lower its living standards to make payments to foreign creditors. But <PERSON> Kahan </PERSON> said, `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is not just another country.'' Foreigners are accumulating IOUs from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because they see the country as a good place to invest, he said. `` We should look at the trade balance but not get overly wrapped up in it as a problem,'' he said.

 The Citizens and <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sovran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced a $ 4.7 billion merger Tuesday that will create the nation's 14th-largest bank. C & amp; S, based in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Sovran </LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, will have total assets of $ 47 billion and almost 1,000 offices in seven states from <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Under a newly formed holding company called <ORGANIZATION> Avantor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the two banks will maintain dual headquarters and retain current management. The merger comes five months after C & amp; S fought off a takeover bid by <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Unlike that proposal, the <ORGANIZATION> C </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; S-Sovran deal is a friendly merger. In a joint statement, <ORGANIZATION> Sovran </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gornto </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and C & amp; S Chairman <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> A. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the deal combines the advantages of size and market strength with success in community-based banking. `` We are creating a large, nationally competitive franchise with a powerful presence in major high-growth markets, and we're underwriting it with superior credit quality,'' they said in a statement `` This is a company that will be completely focused on service, efficiency and profitability,'' the statement said. The boards of the two companies have approved the agreement. Final approval from shareholders and federal and state regulators is expected in the first quarter of 1990. Both companies will remain in existence as subsidiaries of the new umbrella organization. A new board of directors will be established with 15 members from Sovran and 14 from C & amp; S. `` It's a big deal,'' said <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON> <PERSON> Shockley </PERSON>, a banking industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It's going to create the powerhouse in the Southeast. C & amp; S has 489 bank offices in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. Sovran has 487 offices in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Scredon </PERSON>, a C & amp; S spokesman in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said the merger has been discussed on and off for about two years. `` We feel it's a perfect fit,'' <PERSON> Scredon </PERSON> said. `` We do n't overlap ... and we each double our market presence. We both feel it could n't be any better.'' <PERSON> Scredon </PERSON> said customers should not see any immediate changes when the merger is completed, but once the two institutions pool resources new services probably will be offered. Under the merger agreement, each of Sovran's 59.8 million shares of outstanding common stock will convert into 1.23 shares of the new company's common stock. Each of C & amp; S's 62 million shares of outstanding common stock will convert into 1.0 shares of the new company's common stock. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> will become chairman and chief executive officer of the new company while retaining his position at <ORGANIZATION> C </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gornto </PERSON> will become chairman of the new company's executive committee and will retain his position at the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> bank. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bottorff </PERSON>, Sovran's president and chief operating officer, will be president and chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION> Avantor </ORGANIZATION> and would become chief executive of the new company upon <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s retirement At that time, <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, now president of <ORGANIZATION> C </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; S, would become <ORGANIZATION> Avantor </ORGANIZATION> chairman. Last spring, <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, N.C.-based <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> targeted C & amp; S in a $ 2.4 billion takeover bid.

 A forecast of ideal harvest weather sent some grain futures prices lower Tuesday, but the selloff helped to bolster cattle prices. Wheat futures prices moved higher, while soybeans prices tumbled and corn futures were mostly lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts said the outlook for perfect harvest weather in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> growing areas depressed corn and soybeans. On other markets, feeder cattle prices rose, live hogs gained, precious metals fell and energy prices were mixed. <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said a lack of any real export demand for soybeans was weighing on futures prices. Wheat prices, however, were supported by Monday's announcement from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> of a sale to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> of 300,000 metric tons and anticipation of more export business this week, traders said. Activity in the corn pit was light as traders awaited a <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> grain report on Thursday, said analyst <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Leighty </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Wheat settled 2 \ cents to 4 \ cents higher, with December at $ 3.94 \ a bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to -RCB- cent higher, with December at $ 2.29 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 1 -LCB- cents to 2 cents higher, with December at $ 1.43 -LCB- a bushel; and soybeans were 1 cent to 6 \ cents lower, with November at $ 5.66 At the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, futures prices for live cattle soared, while feeder cattle prices were higher and pork complex futures were mixed. Live cattle futures rallied on higher cash prices in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, analysts said. `` Traders wanted something to be bullish about, and when they got bullish news, they took prices higher,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Feeder cattle prices were supported by live cattle prices and a selloff in grains Live hogs also were supported by higher cash prices. Live cattle settled .38 cent to 1 cent higher, with the contract for October at 72.07 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .72 cent higher, with September at 83.25 cents a pound; live hogs were .28 cent lower to .27 cent higher with October at 43.42 cents a pound; and pork bellies were .10 cent lower to .30 cent higher with February at 48.50 cents a pound. Futures prices for precious metals fell on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Gold set a new high of $ 375.30 for the December contract, recovering $ 15 since it hit a low on Sept 15 of $ 360.60. But later in the session prices slipped when pressure on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar subsided Tuesday, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON>, a precious metals analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Gold settled $ 1.30 to $ 1.60 lower, with the contract for September at $ 368.50 a troy ounce; and silver was 2 cents lower, with September at $ 5.263 a troy ounce Energy prices were mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Crude oil prices had a choppy session, losing some ground after <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers postponed their meeting in <LOCATION> Geneza </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. The ministers were studying an Iranian proposal to increase the production ceiling to between 20.5 million barrels a day and 21 million barrels. Unleaded gasoline followed crude lower, but heating oil prices were higher mainly from traders selling the gasoline and using those profits to buy heating oil, said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzeo </PERSON>, an energy specialist in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Crude oil was .02 cent lower to .10 cent higher, with the contract for November at $ 19.53 a barrel; heating oil was .07 cent to .20 cent higher, with October at 57.71 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was 1.29 cents lower to .08 cent higher, with October at 60.38 cents a gallon

 Independent television stations Tuesday took a swing at baseball owners for increasingly limiting television viewing of the `` American Pastime'' to homes with cable TV. Recent agreements giving cable companies rights to <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> games and a four-year, $ 400 million contract that gives the <ORGANIZATION> ESPN </ORGANIZATION> cable network rights to Wednesday and Sunday night baseball games typify the flight of sports to cable TV, said <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> Padden </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Assocation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stations </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Padden </PERSON>, in a letter Tuesday to <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>, the new commisioner of <ORGANIZATION> Major </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baseball </ORGANIZATION>, said that given `` the clear trends in the cable industry ... it seems likely that legislation will be necessary to preserve sports on free TV.'' But before that happens, `` we ask you to consider mutually voluntary changes'' in the <ORGANIZATION> ESPN </ORGANIZATION> contract, <PERSON> Padden </PERSON> said. `` Specifically, we are concerned about those provisions that restrict our right to broadcast baseball games on Wednesday and Sunday evenings.'' <PERSON> Padden </PERSON> disputed Major League Baseball's assertion that the <ORGANIZATION> ESPN </ORGANIZATION> contract would expand TV viewers' choices. `` Fans will experience a diminution in the supply of baseball,'' <PERSON> Padden </PERSON> said. `` More to the point, you will be restricting access to Major League Baseball only to those who have access to cable, and-or can afford cable rates which average over $ 25 a month. For the ` American Pastime,' we find this contrary to the public interest.'' Calls to the Major League Baseball office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for comment were not immediately returned. <PERSON> Padden </PERSON>'s letter grew out of a meeting this month in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of TV station executives from 24 of the 26 cities that have Major League Baseball. The executives agreed to try to get <ORGANIZATION> MLB </ORGANIZATION> to alter the <ORGANIZATION> ESPN </ORGANIZATION> contract. The TV executives also were concerned about cable TV contracts for sports at Big 10, <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> 10 and Southeastern Conference schools. They said such contracts point to a day when all sports will be on pay TV. The station executives have enlisted the aid of Sens. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, D-Tenn., to press their case in The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has said that local broadcasters are showing 40 percent more professional baseball games now when compared with 1975 and that cable is not siphoning away free TV sports.

 <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Andersen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and Price Waterhouse, citing regulatory concerns and other problems, announced Tuesday they had scrapped plans for a merger that would have created the world's biggest accounting firm. A Price Waterhouse official, who asked not to be identified, said the key stumbling block to the merger was `` concern over the regulatory environment,'' because the two firms represent so many competing companies. However, another source close to the talks, who asked not to be named, confirmed published reports that differences over funding of the firms' retirement plans, the name of the combined firm and other issues had hampered the talks. In a joint statement, the chiefs of the two accounting giants said the merger discussions `` were discontinued because differences could not be resolved within a realistic time frame.'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Connor </PERSON>, chairman of Price Waterhouse, and <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinbach </PERSON>, <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>'s chief executive, stated both firms `` have emerged from the talks with great respect for one another and better insight into the professional service environment in which they operate.'' The statement said confidentiality agreements had been signed by both firms and `` therefore there will be no public comment by either firm on details of the discussions.'' The firms originally announced merger talks in July, amid a backdrop of other mergers among the Big Eight accounting firms aiming to face heightened global competition. For example, analysts say the firms want to be better positioned to compete once the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> drops its internal trade barriers in 1992. <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Whinney </ORGANIZATION> combined to form <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, now the world's biggest accounting firm, while <ORGANIZATION> Deloitte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haskins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Sells joined forces with <ORGANIZATION> Touche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, forming No. 4 <ORGANIZATION> Deloitte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Touche. Price Waterhouse and <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> announced on Sept. 5 that they would need more time to continue their negotiations. Industry analysts said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had been examining the possible ramifications of an Andersen-Price Waterhouse combination, which would have merged the nation's second - and sixth-largest firms, respectively One obstacle to the merger was the potential conflict of interest in the firms' dealings with such major corporate clients as <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the Price Waterhouse official said. Chicago-based <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>'s consulting division has joint ventures with both corporations to develop computer integration products, while Price is the auditor for both companies. <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> rules bar an accounting firm from participating in joint ventures with audit clients because of possible conflicts of interest. The official of New York-based Price Waterhouse said the non-regulatory issues, such as the differences over funding the retirement plans, were not critical, although `` it is not unreasonable to expect each side to have differences over what caused the failure to reach agreement.'' The official said he would n't rule out renewed merger talks, `` but not in the near term. We might agree to look at it again in two or three years from now.'' Industry observers predict that the value of merging was great enough to possibly inspire the firms to deal with and possibly overcome the hurdles that scuttled the plan. `` I continue to see tremendous benefits to there being a merger and tremendous negatives to both firms if there is not a merger,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION> Emerson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>. A merger would have created the world's largest accounting firm, reaping $ 5 billion a year in worldwide revenue and $ 2.7 billion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> revenue Together, the firm would have audited 40 percent of the Fortune 500 companies. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> fell to the No. 2 spot among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> accounting firms earlier this year after <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Whinney </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> merged.

 Discoveries of new reserves and increases in exploration spending have helped the nation's ailing petroleum industry turn toward recovery, according to a study released Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Andersen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s 1989 Reserve Disclosures Survey of 244 public petroleum companies said the increases are the first such significant moves since 1985. `` While this is far from a sign that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil and gas industry is about to return to boom times, it does indicate that many companies have successfully adapted to today's low price environment,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burk </PERSON>, managing director of the accounting firm's oil and gas industry services. <PERSON> Burk </PERSON> said capital expenditures to acquire, explore or develop oil and gas properties increased in 1988 by 53 percent to $ 24.6 billion. Capital expenditures fell more than 70 percent from 1984 through 1987. In 1988, $ 5.5 billion of the spending increase _ 65 percent _ was related to surveyed companies acquiring <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION>'s oil and gas properties. With the <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> deal, the acquisitions of proved properties reached the highest levels since 1984. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gas reserves also increased for the first time since 1984 to rise to 103.9 trillion cubic feet -LRB- TCF -RRB-. In 1987, gas reserves had dropped for the fourth consecutive year, to 103 TCF. But in 1988, petroleum companies were able to replace more than half their oil and gas production through discoveries of new reserves. <PERSON> Burk </PERSON> said the findings show an industry making careful decisions about its future. `` Management is being very selective in choosing their development sites,'' he said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exploration and production companies are repositioning by consolidating operations, stressing technological innovation, improving operating efficiencies, redirecting exploration and development activities and investments, and buying and selling reserves, he said. <PERSON> Burk </PERSON> said companies `` continued to drill their best prospects'' and reported the lowest finding cost for new wells of the 1980s at $ 7.70 per barrel. `` I think we will continue to see improvements in 1989,'' <PERSON> Burk </PERSON> said. `` Both oil and gas have continued to show improvements over 1988. <PERSON> Burk </PERSON> said since <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> began compiling data for the forecasts 10 years ago, many firms have been acquired or simply gone out of business. In the past five years, he said 36 companies have dropped from the list of 244 public companies. `` I think overall, these are good things _ more positives than negatives,'' <PERSON> Burk </PERSON> said. `` It certainly will have a positive effect in the amount of money people will spend in drilling.'' Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Enron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Tuesday released a study that forecast a natural gas market of 19 to 21 <ORGANIZATION> TCF </ORGANIZATION> by the year 2000 <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> showed that the leading public companies produced 9.4 TCF of natural gas in 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Enron </ORGANIZATION> officials said more gas-fired power plants are likely to be built because of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's proposed environmental incentives for natural gas use.

 <PERSON> Adolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Coors </PERSON>' great grandsons broke with a family tradition of never borrowing money to brew beer when they decided to buy most of <ORGANIZATION> Stroh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 425 million. But tradition is as strong as ever at <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> men sit down to lunch every day in the dining room of the mansion <ORGANIZATION> Adolph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> built more than a century ago on the brewery grounds. As a 26-year-old immigrant who left <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to avoid military service, <ORGANIZATION> Adolph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> founded a modest brewery on the banks of <LOCATION> Clear </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> in 1873, just 14 years after gold-seekers descended on the area. But Coors lacked the gold-seekers' gambling instincts; his cardinal rules were to brew good beer and stay out of debt doing it. Over the years, the founder passed on his cautious, self-reliant streak to his son, <PERSON> Adolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Coors </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, and then to the grandsons, <PERSON> William </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Coors </PERSON>. The family business grew into the nation's fourth-largest brewery The announcement Monday that <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> was going to pay $ 425 million for Detroit-based <ORGANIZATION> Stroh </ORGANIZATION>'s brewing assets represented a break with the past. The deal will give <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> 18 <ORGANIZATION> Stroh </ORGANIZATION> brands, five <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> breweries and two can plants. If completed as expected early next year, the acquisition will boost <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION>' annual sales to nearly $ 3 billion. Coors would become the nation's No. 3 brewer, behind <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. To complete the deal, <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> will have to borrow an estimated $ 300 million. And because the Coors family has assiduously avoided such borrowing throughout its history _ <ORGANIZATION> Adolph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> traditionally has paid cash when it wanted something _ the company has no bond rating. Still, it is not expected to have trouble finding or repaying the money. `` The company believes in a strong balance sheet. If you have a strong balance sheet, it enables you to make a move like we have with <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Klugman </PERSON>, vice president of development for <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday. The Coors family controls 100 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Adolph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION>' Class A voting stock and about a third of its nonvoting, publicly traded Class B stock. The Stroh acquisition is a clear indication that the fourth-generation <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> brothers _ <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> _ are firmly in control one year after the torch was passed by their uncle, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Coors </PERSON>, and their father, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Coors </PERSON>, in a reorganization. All five of <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Coors </PERSON>' sons attend to family business. While <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Coors </PERSON>, 43, runs the beer-brewing operation and was the key figure in the Stroh deal, <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Coors </PERSON>, 44, is president of <ORGANIZATION> Adolph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Coors </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 46, the oldest son, is head of <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Porcelain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos </ORGANIZATION>. The two other brothers, <PERSON> Grover </PERSON>, 39, and <PERSON> John </PERSON>, 33, have lesser roles in the family business _ <PERSON> Grover </PERSON> heads <ORGANIZATION> MicroLithics </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary that produces military systems, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> is in charge of <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION>' customer satisfaction division. `` <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> and I are running the business,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Coors </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, when asked what role his uncle, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Coors </PERSON>, 73, the company chairman, and <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Coors </PERSON>, 72, vice chairman, continue to play in the firm's day-to-day operations. Despite the decision to incur major debt, the Coors family remains a strong believer in tradition. Every day that business does not take them out of town, the brothers lunch inside the 22-room Coors mansion, the official family residence on the brewery grounds that <PERSON> Adolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Coors </PERSON> built. That kind of traditionalism over the years has been reflected in the Coors' politically conservative image, especially concerning organized labor. A year after Brewery Workers union went on strike in 1977 over <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION>' desire to subject its workers to lie-detector tests, Coors replaced the strikers with non-union employees. That earned the company the enmity of national labor and triggered a national consumer boycott by the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> that lasted 10 years. The boycott ended after <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> pledged not to interfere with union organizing efforts at <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION>, although brewery workers rejected the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union in an election in December 1988. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Coors </PERSON>, a prominent conservative and friend of former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, was an outspoken member of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s so-called `` kitchen cabinet'' during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s early presidential years An active supporter of anti-communist causes, <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> also testified on behalf of Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Iran-Contra hearings. Documents released during those hearings showed that a $ 65,000 donation by <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> wound up in a <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> bank account used to buy arms for Nicaraguan rebels.

 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers stepped up bargaining Tuesday in a last-ditch effort to increase the oil cartel's production ceiling above 19.5 million barrels a day for the rest of 1989 without sending prices into a freefall. The 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries three times postponed what was expected to be a final round of talks to consider a new Iranian proposal. Talks were to resume Wednesday evening. `` It has to cook some,'' Iraqi Oil Minister <PERSON> Issam </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Chalabi </PERSON> said of the Iranian plan. But <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> immediately threw cold water on the idea. `` We will not accept it,'' insisted a senior Libyan delegate, who demanded anonymity. Earlier, Iranian Oil Minister <PERSON> Gholamreza </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> said his country had offered a plan to raise the production ceiling in the last quarter of the year. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> suggested hiking the cap to between 20.5 million barrels a day and 21 million barrels. The ministers talks have centered on raising the production cap from the current 19.5 million barrel limit to a level between 20 million barrels a day and 21 million barrels, according to delegates. The additional amount under the Iranian plan would be divided under a formula that would meet the demands of <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> for bigger shares of the production pie. All countries would get larger individual quotas, meaning they could pump more in the last quarter than now but some would see their percentage share of the total output shrink. `` It seems -LRB- there will be -RRB- a little increase,'' said a senior member of one delegation, who demanded anonymity. `` But we still have different positions. It's a slow process.'' `` There are some members that are still taking a very hard line,'' said another delegate, also on condition of anonymity. The meeting began Saturday with the delegates arguing over whether the market was strong enough to absorb an increase in production without sending prices tumbling. The cartel has been overproducing, pumping more crude than allowed under an output agreement signed in June. Analysts' estimate <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production at about 22 million barrels daily Gasoline prices at the pump were likely to remain about the same or even fall a few cents in the long term if production were increased, according to analysts. The average price of a basket of crudes monitored by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> was recently about $ 1 under the cartel's benchmark of $ 18 a 42-gallon barrel. West Texas Intermediate, the major <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> grade, has been trading at about $ 19.50 to $ 20 a barrel. The ministers were reported close to an agreement Monday but ran into trouble getting all countries to sign on to the deal. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> have been producing well beyond their individual quotas in an effort to press their case for higher shares. Others countries, though, are unwilling to give in to those two nations and want any increase shared proportionately. Analysts say <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> have been producing as much as double their quotas of about 1 million barrels each. The ministers could extend the current ceiling until the end of the year. But analysts say that might leave the impression of disarray in the cartel's ranks. It also could prompt some countries to widen their taps to take advantage of the firm market. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> has predicted that demand in the final quarter will be 22 million barrels a day. The ministers are to meet again in late November to hammer out a production pact for the first six months of 1990. This week's talks were officially held by a monitoring panel made up of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. The other <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members _ <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> _ were invited to attend.

 Attorneys for two leading defense contractors battling over a canceled, top-secret <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> contract squared off Tuesday in state court, where they told a judge that millions of dollars, hundreds of jobs and national security were at stake. <ORGANIZATION> Norden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Norwalk-based subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, is seeking unspecified damages in excess of $ 15,000 in its lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> filed the breach of contract lawsuit in <ORGANIZATION> Stamford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in June after <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> dropped it from a program to develop the Advanced Tactical Aircraft, the next generation of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> jet fighters. General Dynamics is the prime contractor in the $ 4 billion project. It had awarded <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> a $ 114 million subcontract in January 1988 to develop an in-air radar system for the new fighter jet. An attorney for <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> argued Tuesday that the lawsuit should be dismissed because it involves top-secret information and threatens national security. But following two hours of arguments, Judge <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cioffi </PERSON> recessed the hearing without issuing a ruling. <PERSON> Cioffi </PERSON> said later in his chambers that he needs to research the case before issuing a written decision. He was unable to say how long the research might take. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenster </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney representing <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> was dropped from the so-called A-12 project because it was `` failing to make progress'' in developing the radar system. He said he could n't prove the claim in court because the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has refused to release necessary documents. `` Very little about this contract can be described to the court since those matters are classified,'' <PERSON> Fenster </PERSON> said. The attorney asked <PERSON> Cioffi </PERSON> to dismiss the lawsuit because it threatens national security. He explained that <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> can defend itself only by breaking the law and releasing top-secret documents. <PERSON> Cioffi </PERSON>, however, questioned that argument. He said a court case can be dismissed on national security grounds only at the request of the federal government, not one of its contractors. `` If the government is so concerned, why are n't they here?'' <PERSON> Cioffi </PERSON> asked. <PERSON> Fenster </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had n't formally sought dismissal of the case because it does n't like to take sides in disputes between contractors. But <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. Work of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had n't intervened because it expected the lawsuit to go forward. `` Norden can, and <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> will prove all the claims ... without classified information,'' Work said. He said that when the contract was canceled in April, <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> had done $ 50 million worth of work on the radar system, but <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> had reimbursed it for only $ 11 million. Work said the loss of the contract also forced <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> to dismiss hundreds of engineers and other workers.

 Four beer companies challenged <ORGANIZATION> Adolph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 425 million buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Stroh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on antitrust grounds Tuesday, saying they would file a federal lawsuit and seek help from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The buyout of most of <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON>'s assets, proposed Monday, would create a mega-brewery capable of challenging industry giants <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> unit of <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, analysts said Coors is the No. 4 beer maker and Stroh No. 3. The merged company would have annual shipments of 32 million to 36 million barrels a year, compared with <PERSON> Busch </PERSON>'s 80 million barrels and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s 40 million. That is too big to suit <ORGANIZATION> Pabst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a national brand, and the regional <ORGANIZATION> Falstaff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pearl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which together ship 7 -LCB- million barrels of beer a year, or about 3 percent of the market. Those companies, which are owned by <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> P </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, said the acquisition would violate the Clayton Act and other federal laws designed to promote competition. `` Two of the big boys are getting together to make a bigger boy,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bitting </PERSON>, general counsel for <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P, said from his <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> office. `` It's difficult to compete now and it will be damn near impossible to compete if this merger goes through,'' <PERSON> Bitting </PERSON> said. `` You'll wind up with no second-tier brewers except for imports, mom-and-pops, and the microbreweries,'' or tiny specialty brewers. He said <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> P </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> would appear at a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> hearing into the matter Oct. 9, and intended to file at least one lawsuit. The merger of Coors and <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> would be twice as anticompetitive as allowed under an index the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> uses in determining whether to join antitrust suits, <PERSON> Bitting </PERSON> maintained. <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Klugman </PERSON>, vice president of development for <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION>, declined to make detailed comment, saying the Golden, Colo.-based company had not seen `` the language or the basis for the lawsuit.'' `` In general, it is our belief that this acquisition is extremely pro-consumer and pro-competitive,'' <PERSON> Klugman </PERSON> said. Combining Detroit-based <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> with Coors would produce a company with 18.7 percent of the beer market, far ahead of the next, <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heileman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which has about a 7 percent share. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harriman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the combination would mean, among other things, that Coors could more easily advertise and distribute its products nationwide. The agreement would give <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> most of <ORGANIZATION> Stroh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s brewing and container facilities and brands

 Two <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> shareholders filed a lawsuit Tuesday seeking to block the $ 750 million sale of the company to a <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> unit. The lawsuit, filed in <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pleas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, contends that <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION> shareholders could reap a much higher profit if other bids were sought for the company before it were sold. It also alleges that the takeover came when the building materials company was poised to increase its earnings and that top management had failed to tell shareholders the full extent of that potential. The suit was filed by shareholders <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Roever </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Citron </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, as a class action on behalf of 4,300 stockholders. <PERSON> Jessie </PERSON> <PERSON> Philips </PERSON>, the company's founder and chairman, announced the deal Monday in which <ORGANIZATION> MLPI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> will pay $ 25.50 for each of <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION>' outstanding shares. <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> declined comment on the suit. The lawsuit, which names <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION> and several other company executives, alleges the deal was undertaken to allow some defendants to remain as officers of the new company while cashing out shareholders at an unfair price. It called the deal `` an attempt by defendants to aggrandize their personal and financial positions and interests and to enrich themselves at the expense of and to the detriment of the public stockholders.'' The lawsuit requests an injunction blocking the deal and unspecified compensatory damages. <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION> manufactures components for buildings, manufactured homes, recreational vehicles and the transportation industry. It has about 10,000 workers in 50 locations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. According to the lawsuit, there were more than 28 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> common stock as of June 7. It said <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Philips </PERSON> owns about 1.5 million shares, or 5.4 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION>, who earlier this year announced plans to retire, has said he intends to vote in favor of the stock sale.

 <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday its board will reconvene Wednesday and may act on a buyout offer from an unidentified suitor, widely believed to be <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Trading in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> stock was active for the second consecutive session on the reports that <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> had offered about $ 3 billion for the film and television The rumored deal also boosted the prices of stocks of other entertainment companies. The deal would be another in a wave of consolidation that has swept through the entertainment business in recent years as companies have sought to position themselves to compete in increasingly accessible global media markets. <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns 49 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s stock, each declined comment on the published reports that <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> was offering between $ 26 and $ 28 a share for all of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s common stock. <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> had about 111 million common shares outstanding as of May 31. <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> was the most active issue on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, dropping 12 -LCB- cents a share to $ 26.25 on volume of nearly 4.2 million shares. <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> had jumped $ 5.25 a share Monday when it disclosed it was `` in discussions with a third party involving their acquisition for cash of all of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s outstanding shares.'' On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> said its board had met Monday night to review those discussions and then adjourned until Wednesday when `` it is anticipated that further action will be taken.'' <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> reportedly have been in talks for months, and <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> is known to be eager to expand its holdings in the entertainment field as a complement to its longstanding electronic hardware business. <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> has indicated its interest in buying a movie studio and <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, with a huge library of both films and TV programs could provide a lucrative new source of revenue for a company that has specialized in producing the videocassette recorders and other hardware on which to display those shows. Elsewhere in the entertainment group, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> rose $ 1.50 a share to $ 56.25; <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> climbed $ 2 a share to $ 65.62 -LCB- and <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> rose 62 -LCB- cents a share to $ 22.75. The rumored Sony-Columbia deal `` highlights the scarcity value'' to the remaining independent production companies such as <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, the entertainment industry analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <PERSON> Mara </PERSON> <PERSON> Balsbaugh </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said upcoming technology developments by companies like <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> are likely to expand global demand for programming to the benefit of companies that have large film and TV libraries <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> has a library of more than 2,700 films and 23,000 TV episodes. `` Over time, there is a case for continued consolidation in the industry. The list of buyers is a lot longer than the list of sellers,'' she said. These and other analysts said it was possible but unlikely that a third party would emerge with a bid that could scuttle a deal between <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>. One potential competitor has taken himself out of the running. A spokesman for <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> made an unsuccessful $ 1.4 billion bid recently for <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday that <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> was not interested in getting into the bidding for <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> accepted a $ 1.5 billion buyout offer from the <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> earlier this month. <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is on the verge of completing its acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> movie studio and the TV production company <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> bought 20th Century <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> three years ago. <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tri-Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> studios have captured 14 percent of the domestic box office revenue this year, trailing <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> and Paramount. But industry watchers term its performance disappointing. Its recent films have included `` Ghostbusters II,'' `` The Karate Kid Part III,'' `` Casualties of War'' and `` Lock Up.'' The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in Wednesday editions that movie producer <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Guber </PERSON> was expected to replace <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> as president and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> if the <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> buyout is approved. <PERSON> Guber </PERSON>, who co-produced `` Batman,'' `` Rainman,'' and `` Flashdance,'' is considered one of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s top producers. <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> has been more successful in TV programming and produces or distributes 11 series that are being shown in prime time, including five new series. They include `` Who's the Boss'' and `` Designing Women.'' It also operates about 820 movie screens in 220 locations.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar retreated further against the Japanese yen during morning trading Wednesday, pressured by central bank dollar-selling, dealers said. Share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> were firmer as they reached a new high. The dollar was changing hands at 141.35 yen at late morning, down 1.45 yen from Tuesday's close of 142.80 yen. After opening at 141.60 yen, the currency ranged from 141.00 to 141.62 yen. Currency dealers said the coordinated intervention, conducted by central banks from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, followed on the heels of a wave of central bank action in overseas market Tuesday, meant to check the dollar's upward trend. The amount of intervention was not immediately known, but it followed similar concerted action by the three central banks Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's central bank, does not comment on its monetary activities. `` The concerted intervention represented a firm commitment by the monetary authorities to contain the dollar's upward move,'' following the weekend meeting of the Group of Seven nations, said a dealer with a major commercial bank in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, who spoke anonymously. At the end of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> meeting, finance ministers and central bankers from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> said in a statement that the dollar's strength was inconsistent with economic fundamentals. On the stock market, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues gained 93.63 points, or 0.26 percent, closing the morning session at 35,538.45, a new high. The Nikkei index posted a 484.11-point gain the previous day for a record closing 35,444.82. Securities dealers said the market mood remained positive after Tuesday's advances, but institutional investors were still cautiously watching the direction of the foreign exchange rates. `` The market was further encouraged by the yen's appreciation against the dollar,'' said a dealer of a major Japanese securities brokerage who spoke anonymously.

<HEAD>Report: Venezuela Offers New Debt-Reduction Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> has dropped its demands for a 50 percent reduction in its debt to commercial banks and plans to offer new proposals in an attempt to revive negotiations with the financial institutions, according to a published report. The changes were detailed Monday by <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Fandeo </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s minister of planning, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Tuesday editions. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said an agreement was near on a $ 600 million interim loan from the banks. The loan would enable the South American nation to meet some interest payments missed over the last several months `` in order to create the atmosphere so the negotiating process could speed up.'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, interviewed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> at the annual meetings of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, said the changes were made to `` accommodate the realities of the banks.'' He was referring to the different legal and accounting rules in differing countries. He added that <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> had not changed its position in response to moves in the last few weeks by three major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks to increase their reserves for bad Third World loans. The moves by the banks were seen as making it more difficult for Third World debtors to restructure their debts. Instead of its 50 percent reduction in its $ 21 billion in loans from commercial banks, a goal the banks rejected, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> will now offer the banks a broad range of options on debt reduction, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said. The options would include reducing the debt by various levels, starting at 60 percent and going to below the 35 percent level negotiated in a debt agreement with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Banks also would have the option of making new loans, he said. Offering various debt reduction levels to different banks would make it easier to negotiate than trying to reach agreement on one number among all banks, he said.

 Interest rates on short-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities rose in Monday's auction to the highest level in three weeks. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sold $ 7.4 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.72 percent, up from 7.64 percent last week.

 <ORGANIZATION> Seaman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Furniture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> says it had agreed in principle with its banks on a partial repayment plan that would include a fresh $ 42 million investment by <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION>'s investors and members of the <PERSON> Seaman </PERSON> family. <PERSON> Seaman </PERSON> went private two years ago in a $ 360 million buyout arranged by <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> but ran into trouble making debt payments because of a downturn in its major market, <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. The troubles of the 31-store furniture chain came as an embarrassment to <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> by raising questions about how thoroughly it had investigated <PERSON> Seaman </PERSON>'s prospects before backing the buyout. The proposal announced Monday would keep <PERSON> Seaman </PERSON> afloat by slashing and stretching out its debt to banks and giving paper instead of cash in payments to junk bond holders until 1996. Creditors would also get an unspecified amount of <PERSON> Seaman </PERSON>'s stock. The deal requires approval by the holders of 90 percent of its junk bonds. The banks have already agreed to it in principle, <PERSON> Seaman </PERSON> said. News of the accord boosted the price of <PERSON> Seaman </PERSON>'s junk bonds, which had lost more than 90 percent of their face value. Its junk bond issue was trading Monday at $ 110 bid and $ 140 asked per $ 1,000 face value, up from about $ 70 bid before the announcement, according to <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>, head of junk bond trading at <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` The company's in wonderful shape now, especially with the insertion of the cash,'' <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaman </PERSON>, the chief executive, said in an interview. <PERSON> Seaman </PERSON> said the company has opened five stores in the last 12 months while closing one. A news release said the refinancing will let it `` continue to aggressively explore new sites in 1990 and take advantage of the opportunities we see developing.'' In exchange for $ 265 million in existing bank debt, banks would receive $ 150 million in senior debt, $ 25 million in subordinated pay-in-kind notes and a `` substantial amount of equity,'' <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaman </PERSON> said. The pay-in-kind notes would pay interest in the form of more notes rather than cash until 1996. They would pay interest in cash from then until they mature in 1999. Banks agreed to receive payments of interest but not principal on $ 125 million of their debt from now through Nov. 15, 1992. There would be no payments even of interest on the remaining $ 25 million until that date. The investors who put in the extra $ 42 million would receive senior subordinated notes. The share that each of the investors would put in was not specified. Owners of <PERSON> Seaman </PERSON>'s roughly $ 83 million in outstanding junk bonds would get $ 20.8 million face value of new pay-in-kind notes and 8 percent of the stock in <LOCATION> Seaman </LOCATION> in exchange for 90 percent of those junk bonds. The terms of those pay-in-kind notes were not specified.

<HEAD>Record $187.1 Billion in Bonds Issued in First Three Quarters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A record $ 187.1 billion in debt securities was issued to the public in the first three quarters of this year as interest rates dropped, according to a survey. <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, in a preliminary survey released Monday for the first nine months, noted that, on the other hand, the volume of common stock brought to market fell sharply. The survey covers Jan. 1 through Sept. 20. The volume of Treasury bonds and other debt securities issued jumped to $ 187.1 billion during the first three quarters, up from $ 181.4 billion in the same period last year and surpassing the previous nine-month record of $ 184.2 billion in the first three quarters of 1987. The sales were stimulated by falling interest rates, <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> noted. When interest rates decline, bond prices rise. The rate on the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s key 30-year bond, for example, has fallen from 9.08 percent on Jan. 3, the first trading day of the year, to 8.23 percent in early trading Monday. The yield on the closely watched bond dropped on Aug. 2 to 7.84 percent, its lowest level since April 1987. While the total volume of bonds issued expanded, `` junk'' bonds fared poorly during the period, the consulting firm said. It blamed the recent shakeout in the junk bond market for the smallest number of the high-risk, high-yield bonds being issued since 1984. Ninety-five junk bond offerings were made during the first nine months, down from 115 in the same period last year. The total volume of junk bonds offered was nearly stable, at $ 19.28 billion compared with $ 19.36 billion in 1988. But around $ 4 billion of this year's volume was accounted for by the $ 24.53 billion leveraged buyout of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, noted <PERSON> Francine </PERSON> <PERSON> Wissak </PERSON>, an assistant vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION>. New issues of common stock also turned in a lackluster performance, according to the survey. Although the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials soared during the period, surpassing the 2,700 level, common stock issued raised only $ 13.5 billion, down from $ 23.8 billion in the first nine months of 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> continued to be the leading manager of new bond and stock issues with 17 percent of the market, according to the survey

<TEXT>
 A new appliance that can chill beer, keep ice cream frozen and cook pizza has college students clamoring, and the inventor, a former computer salesman, crossing his fingers. The Microfridge, offered by <ORGANIZATION> Microfridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> suburb of <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, is a three-piece appliance composed of a compact refrigerator, a separate freezer compartment and a mini-microwave. The product retails for $ 429. The company founders did more than stack three appliances on top of one another and paint them the same color, however. Their machine, which stands under four feet tall, was invented to use no more power than a compact refrigerator. `` Quite simply, when one unit is running, the other one is off,'' explained co-founder <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, 33, who said he holds two patents on the Microfridge's circuitry. When the microwave is turned on, the freezer and refrigerator shut off temporarily, and resume when the cooking is done, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. Product testing showed that even when the microwave was on for 45 minutes, the refrigerator and freezer sections gained only three degrees, he said. The first shipment of 1,700 Microfridges went out at the end of August, and the company plans two more shipments by the end of November. Sales are expected to top $ 1.9 million this year, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said, and `` the phones are still ringing.'' Microfridge has three distributors, which sell the appliance through colleges, military bases and some retail stores. The device, whose components are made in various countries, is assembled in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arm of <ORGANIZATION> Sanyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, the Japanese electronics and appliance giant `` The biggest problem is going to be eventually we'll have to think about competition, `` said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. `` Once we create a market, either we'll have built up until we're the recognized name, or we wo n't have _ that will allow someone else to come in.'' For now, the efforts of <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> and his co-founders, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Soriano </PERSON>, 47, and <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, 37, are focused on promoting the appliance for use in schools, hotels, office suites and military bases. More than 88 percent of the first shipment was bought by colleges and their students, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. And students are forming waiting lists at <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Zannini </PERSON>, the executive director of housing at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION>, says the school ordered 11 Microfridges for initial testing, welcoming the reduced power requirements. <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Massara </PERSON>, a freshman at <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, raved about her Microfridge. `` I think it could almost be considered a necessity if you're not on the three-meal plan You can make breakfast, Eggo Waffles,'' she said. Because of the Microfridge in her room, <PERSON> Massara </PERSON> plans to go off the full-meal plan, she said. Relying too much on the relatively small college market could ultimately sink <ORGANIZATION> Microfridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, an industry analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> also said the retail price was high enough to be a probable stumbling block `` I think he's got a difficult sale on a price basis, because college students can buy a $ 99 refrigerator and a $ 99 microwave and save yourself a lot of money,'' said <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>. According to <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, however, a separate freezer makes up for that price difference. `` How much is the freezer worth? That's really the question. And because we have an extremely high backlog, it seems to be worth quite a lot,'' he said. <PERSON> Marassa </PERSON> agreed. `` You do n't have to worry about this teensy space not big enough to hold ice cubes,'' she said, referring to the minute freezer compartment of most compact refrigerators. `` I mean, this can hold ice cream.''

<HEAD>Coors Bid for Stroh To Create `Big Three' Brewery Fight</HEAD>

 A $ 425 million agreement in principle for <ORGANIZATION> Adolph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to buy the No. 3-ranked <ORGANIZATION> Stroh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s brands and breweries sets up a `` Big Three'' among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beer makers, analysts said. <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Coors </PERSON> on Monday announced his company's plans to acquire most of <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON>'s assets and send a message to No 1 <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc. and No 2 <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> that <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> is the one to be watched. `` Clearly we are in the beer business,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION>, head of the No. 4 brewer in the nation. `` If we are going to be in the beer business long-term, we've got to be a major and significant competitor.'' <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the sale will result in a `` Big Three'' of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> brewing Combining Detroit-based <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> and Golden-based Coors would produce a company with 18.7 percent of the market, a tougher competitor for the top two and far ahead of the next, <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heileman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which has about a 7 percent share. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harriman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, also of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said that while the acquisition is `` not a sure thing'' _ it still faces several hurdles _ the combination would mean Coors would compete better and benefit from economies of scale, distribution and purchasing. `` You may have more clout all along the line, more bang for the buck in advertising, and more bang for the buck in general,'' he said. `` I think the price is a good one for Coors' standpoint. It looks cheap on the basis of replacement value of the breweries, and they're getting ongoing brands. Those brands are not generating a lot of income, but consumers are buying them and there's some potential there,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. Coors officials said they expect to take nearly 20 percent of the beer market with the <LOCATION> Stroh </LOCATION> acquisition, and become stronger not only from a business standpoint, but from a consumer standpoint. The agreement would give <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> most of <ORGANIZATION> Stroh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s brewing and container facilities and brands `` <ORGANIZATION> Stroh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> will continue to exist, but the operating company will not,'' <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> said. Golden will be headquarters for the entire operation. The purchase by Coors would be paid in part by the assumption of long-term debt and other selected liabilities, with the balance paid in cash. Coors would not disclose the amount of either. The plan would give Coors the following brands: <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON>'s Light; Signature; <PERSON> Schlitz </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Schlitz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Schlitz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Malt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liquor </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Schaefer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> non-alcohol and low-alcohol brands; <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Old </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION>; Red Bull; Silver Thunder; and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barts </LOCATION>, a non-alcohol brand; as well as the licensing rights to <PERSON> Piels </PERSON>, <PERSON> Piels </PERSON> <PERSON> Light </PERSON> and Augsburger. <PERSON> Coors </PERSON> said he did not know which brands would be retained and which discarded. <PERSON> Primo </PERSON>, a Stroh beer brewed in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and distributed in some <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> cities, is not included, and neither is Sundance, a wine cooler. <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> also bottles other wine coolers and drinks that are not included, the chairman said. The move is part of a drive begun in the early 1980s by <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> to expand from a regional to a national brewer. The company now sells its products in 49 states and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> has 10 beer brands. Its main labels are Coors and Coors Light. <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> has been suffering its worst financial troubles since it went national by acquiring <PERSON> Jos </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Schlitz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in 1982. <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> was unable to make inroads on the growth of <PERSON> Anheuser </PERSON> <PERSON> Busch </PERSON>, which dominates the industry with a 41 percent share of the national beer market, far ahead of <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s 21 percent and <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON>'s 11 percent <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> is a unit of <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc The 139-year-old <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> has been looking for potential partners since February and announced Aug. 31 it was laying off 300 of its 1,500 white-collar employees nationwide. Chairman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> said the cuts were being made because the family-owned company had been unable to find a partner. <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> also cut back support of civic and industry affairs and advertising, including auto racing sponsorships. Coors' would acquire <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> plants in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Longview </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Allentown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>. Can plants to be acquired are in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Longview </LOCATION> <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> also has breweries in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Nuys </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, that will not be acquired, <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> plants are represented by the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>, while <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> workers rejected representation by the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> last December. `` We've been in touch with the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> and will want to develop a relationship with them,'' Coors said. The transaction is subject to the negotiation of a definitive agreement, approval by the boards of directors of both companies, and review by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> said. Closing is not expected before early next year.

 The government is asking <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> to disclose how much foreign influence over the airline a planned employee-management takeover would allow, officials said. The inquiry came as The Wall Street Journal reported that <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> had asked <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' new principle owner, <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>, to cut by $ 225 million the $ 400 million investment made in <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the airline's parent corporation, by <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Monday gave <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, until Oct. 10 to furnish information on investors and financial arrangements in the $ 6.5 billion stock buyout plan of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> by the airline's pilots, management and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> is to continue as head of the company under the plan, which would give controlling interest to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> employees. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shane </PERSON>, assistant transportation secretary for policy and international affairs, asked <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> to provide detailed financial information, including the names of any foreign investors and the amount of influence they might have over the new company. The department is conducting a financial fitness review of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> deal to determine whether it will extend the airline's operating certificate under the new ownership A similar review of the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> takeover was completed last week but the results were not announced to the public. `` We are concerned about any aquisition,'' <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> said in the letter to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, `` especially a leverage buyout of either the carrier or its parent that could have a substantial adverse impact on a carrier's financial structure, might otherwise affect its ability to operate safely or meet its financial obligations, or would result in its not being controlled by <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. citizens.'' On the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> takeover, department spokesman <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Paris </PERSON> said he could not confirm the Journal report or give any details of the department's decision on the buyout. <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> made its investment in <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> to help <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> finance the $ 3.65 billion purchase. <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> provided 57 percent of the $ 700 million in equity <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> raised to buy <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> but owns only 5 percent of the airline. Foreign companies can not own more than 25 percent of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline, but <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said last week he was concerned that foreign investors might have more influence than their ownership reflects and could compromise <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiations with other governments over air routes. The Journal also reported that rumors about possible changes in <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION>'s Northwest investment sparked a sell-off of stock in <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' parent corporation. <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> plans to invest $ 750 million in <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>. The department, in its letter to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, asked for a `` citizenship affidavit'' for <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> as it will exist after the takeover. `` Detail any actual or potential ability on the part of these non-citizen entities to influence or control, directly or indirectly, the affairs of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> instructed in the letter. He also asked for any written or oral agreements that might assure that non-citizen lenders can not control <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>.
