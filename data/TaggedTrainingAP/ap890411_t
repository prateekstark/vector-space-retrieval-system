 `` Work to Start At Once on Two Forks Reservoir,'' proclaimed a headline in The <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> 61 years ago, touting a project that would free the city from worry about future water supplies. That 1928 report proved to be a bit optimistic. Not an ounce of concrete has been poured at the proposed dam site on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Platte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> 25 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. And now the federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> may be about to scuttle the dam, whose cost has ballooned from $ 6 million in 1928 to current estimates of $ 500 million to $ 1 billion. In an unusual move, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> began the veto process on the 1.1 million acre-foot dam project March 24. He said it simply was too costly environmentally: It would inundate a gold-medal trout stream and possibly damage a <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> wildlife habitat. Dam supporters can make a final appeal to save the project. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Lathrop </PERSON> said the review process could continue through December. Although the city has adequate supplies at least through the next quarter century, its leaders have n't decided where to turn for water beyond that if Two Forks is defeated. `` We planned well and there's no crisis,'' said <PERSON> Monte </PERSON> <PERSON> Pascoe </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which spent decades developing the proposal. `` We're trying to plan equally well for the next 25 years, and we're being told we ca n't do that. The city currently diverts mountain water across the Continental Divide from the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION>' Western Slope. The dam has been touted by supporters as the best solution to the area's future water needs. Opponents, such as <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Berle </PERSON>, have called the dam an `` environmental and economic monstrosity'' that would destroy scenic Cheesman Canyon in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. They also say it would alter the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Platte </ORGANIZATION>'s flow downstream into <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and affect fragile habitat for 240 species of migrating birds, including the endangered whooping crane and the sandhill crane. Two Forks, just downstream from the confluence of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Platte </LOCATION> and its <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fork </LOCATION>, would stand 615 feet _ about half the height of the Empire State Building _ and would be 1,700 feet long, and from 160 to 467 feet thick. By comparison, <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> <PERSON> Dam </PERSON>, one of the highest concrete dams in the world, is 726 feet tall astride the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and 1,244 feet long with a 660-foot thick concrete base. <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> <PERSON> Dam </PERSON>'s reservoir, <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mead </LOCATION>, on the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona-Nevada </ORGANIZATION> border, stores about 29.7 million acre-feet of water _ one acre-foot is enough water to cover one acre to a depth of one foot _ and covers about 255 square miles. Two Forks, however, would store only 1.1 million acre-feet. It would cover 13.28 square miles and the small community of Deckers. <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> leaders have considered a dam on the river since 1896 and the city began acquiring land for the project in 1923. The most recent attempt to build a dam intensified in 1981 when the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> to study the dam's potential environmental impact. In 1986, the board and the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Providers </ORGANIZATION>, a group of 42 suburban water suppliers, formally applied for a construction permit. The Corps issued a draft environmental impact assessment in 1987 that identified Two Forks as the most environmentally damaging of seven proposed dams on the river, but it also said Two Forks was the most cost-effective way to meet the area's water needs into the 21st century. Metropolitan officials are making contingency plans in addition to continuing the fight for Two Forks, and the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> last week formalized water restrictions. Under the new policy, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> may decide each September whether to restrict additional water connections outside city limits, and may implement rate increases in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and the suburbs to which it sells water. Most of the cities in the metropolitan area purchase water from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pascoe </PERSON> said the board has an adequate supply to meet needs in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> in the immediate future but `` there's no room for error.'' `` We honestly do n't think other supplies for water will be very easy to find,'' he said.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a padlocked shed near the old royal palace, the limousine of the last Afghan king waits in the dust. The black Daimler's tires are flat, but the silver royal crest on the door is untarnished. The car is an apt symbol for <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>, the 74-year-old exile whose return is talked about by Afghans across the political spectrum as a way of ending the decade-old civil war between an authoritarian government and Moslem fundamentalists. Sixteen years after he was deposed, the ex-king remains a symbol of better days _ of a time when Afghans were not slaughtering each other in horrific numbers. The problem is finding a way for him to return. `` The car is ready for him. It would be good if he came back,'' said a man who knew the whereabouts of <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Daimler </ORGANIZATION>. Then, looking around even though no one else was within hearing distance, the slender university graduate added: `` Please do n't write my name. Others are less fearful. `` If King <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> wants to work for his country, he can have a positive role in bringing peace,'' said <PERSON> Wadir </PERSON> <PERSON> Safi </PERSON>, dean of law and political science at <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Even if he did n't do much for the progress of our country, he did n't kill anybody,'' said <PERSON> Safi </PERSON>, who studied at <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Charles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> About a month ago, <PERSON> Safi </PERSON>'s views were published in a new weekly newspaper, the Akbar-e-Hafta. The article was accompanied by the first photograph of the former king that <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> residents can remember seeing published in the government-supervised media since <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> was overthrown in 1973. The issue quickly sold out, although its price of 20 cents is four or five times that of other newspapers. Even illiterate people scrambled for copies. `` All the people like <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>,'' a shopkeeper said on condition of anonymity. `` In <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>'s time there was not killing of people,'' the father of 10 added. Even President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, a former secret police chief, has said talks with the ex-king could be useful. In mid-February, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said he had sent emissaries to <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>'s exile home in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. A spokesman for the aging ex-monarch promptly denied any contacts with <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s Soviet-style regime. U.S.-backed Moslem fundamentalist guerrillas, operating from headquarters across the border in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, are divided about reinstating the monarchy. Any future role in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> has been rejected by hard-liners among the rebels, such as <PERSON> Rasul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayyaf </PERSON>, leader of one of the seven parties in the Pakistan-based guerrilla alliance. Some moderate leaders, such as <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Gailani </PERSON> who once served as the king's religious adviser, say they would accept his return as a constitutional monarch, a sort of living flag to help unite the Afghan people. The king himself seems amenable. In early February, as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was withdrawing its last soldiers from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and ending nine years of combat support for the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government, <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> said: `` I am prepared to render without any claim or precondition any service to my country which would reflect the will of the majority of my compatriots.'' The sticky question is how to reconcile the poles-apart politics of <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION>, the rebels' Islamic fundamentalism and a monarchy The rebels refuse to deal with the party, whose communist beginnings never took root among the fervently capitalist Afghans. The party, whose leadership changes have come only through coup, assassination or purge, says it is willing to `` share'' power but will never step aside completely. In four decades on the throne, <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> himself proved a less than dynamic leader. He was only 19 in 1933 when he became king upon the assassination of his father, <PERSON> Nadir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>. For the next 20 years his uncles ran the country. In 1953, his cousin, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON>, became prime minister and tried to push a feudalistic, tribal nation toward the 20th century by such means as freeing women of their all-enveloping robes. In 1963, <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> finally exerted himself. <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> resigned, waited a decade, and overthrew his cousin the king. Five years later, in 1978, <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> was assassinated in a coup that brought the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to power with a succession of leaders. Since then about 1 million Afghans have been killed in the war. Another 5 million have fled to neighboring <LOCATION> Paistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, leaving <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> with a population of 10 million. Throughout the war, <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Daimler </ORGANIZATION>, a car that is somehow sleek and bulky at the same time, has been unscathed. Periodically it is dusted by a man with only childhood memories of the monarchy, a man who does not want to give his name and hopes the car remains safe until the king returns. The Daimler waits, along with five other royal automobiles, in a simple white-washed structure behind the national museum, abou 300 yards from the early 20th century Darulaman Palace which now houses the defense ministry.

<TEXT>
 A fire erupted Monday at a <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> oil refinery plant, injuring at least seven workers and sending 100-foot flames shooting into the sky. The fire apparently started at 12:46 p.m. when an explosion shook a 100-foot-tall column in a refinery processing plant where gasoline is manufactured, said <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Holt </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. Thick black smoke and flames rose into the sky as about 40 firefighters from <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> and the city of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> battled the blaze, which was declared under control about four hours later, <PERSON> Holt </PERSON> said. `` The fire is still burning and we have not been able to get in to assess the cause or the totality of damage,'' said <PERSON> Holt </PERSON>, who refused to estimate a damage amount. Three Chevron operators were flown to <LOCATION> Brookside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pablo </LOCATION> where a hospital spokesman said they were in stable condition with second degree burns. One man suffered burns over 70 percent of his body and the other two had burns over 20 percent to 30 percent of their bodies. Another Chevron operator was taken to <LOCATION> Doctor </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Pinole </LOCATION>, where he was reported in stable condition after being treated for smoke inhalation, according to the nursing supervisor. <ORGANIZATION> Alta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> reported that one <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> fire marshal was admitted with second degree burns on his face, ears and neck and was having respiratory difficulties, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>. At least two other people were reported injured but there was no immediate word on the extent of their injuries. The facility is <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>'s second largest refinery on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and produces about 265,000 barrels of crude oil daily.

 Opposition politicians and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials praised <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> authorities for the capture of a drug czar believed to control more than half of the cocaine shipped through <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Authorities seized some of <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON>'s assets Monday, including a hotel, pharmacy, real-estate company, bank accounts and various properties. <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON>, 43, was arrested Saturday night in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION>. No value was placed on the assets confiscated Monday, but <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON>'s net worth is estimated to exceed $ 500 million, including at least 50 houses and 200 ranches. Attorney General <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, at a news conference Monday, called <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON> `` the No. 1 drug trafficker in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.'' He said that others arrested in the weekend raids included three of <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON>'s aides as well as the chief federal anti-drug official and five other ranking police officers in <LOCATION> Sinaloa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON>'s home state. `` We congratulate the judicial police for the apprehension of the drug czar and we praise the role of the military in <LOCATION> Sinaloa </LOCATION>, where they detained police involved in drug trafficking,'' <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Noyola </PERSON>, spokesman for the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, told the government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Yanez </PERSON>, a leader of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION>: `` We hope that this not only affects the circulation of drugs but that it attacks the problem starting with production,'' <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> noted that President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, who took office in January, has vowed to stop drug dealing and corruption. The raids were the third dramatic example of <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' determination In January he put the corrupt leader of the oil workers' union behind bars and in February a leading stockbroker went to jail. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, told reporters, `` The message ... is that President <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> means business.'' `` To pull this thing off the way it was done is a tribute'' to Mexican authorities, he added. `` The impact it has on the drug market, we can say, is extremely significant.'' <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON>, thought to head a ring that smuggled up to 4 tons of cocaine a month into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, had been sought for years but `` obtained protection from diverse authorities,'' <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> said <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON> `` was as important as any major trafficker in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' and `` has been operating almost with impunity in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> because of the protection he received.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities believe <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON> was involved in the 1985 slaying of American drug agent <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> said <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON> opposed killing <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> and that his office had no evidence linking him directly to the killing. <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> added, however, that <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON> was the `` intellectual author'' of the organization that killed <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>. <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> was kidnapped outside the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consulate in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION> in 1985 and tortured and killed.

<TEXT>
 The threat to legalized abortion has infused the women's movement with a passion and purpose unmatched since the determined but losing campaign to ratify the equal rights amendment. Women are turning out, joining up and writing checks in what one organizer called `` a torrent of activity'' provoked by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to re-examine <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, its 1973 ruling that legalized abortion. `` It's like spontaneous combustion or a prairie fire,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, D-Colo., co-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> on Women's Issues The throngs that turned out for Sunday's abortion rights march were only the most visible aspect of an energized movement. March organizers report their contributions have risen 50 percent in recent months. One group, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, raised $ 600,000 in March 1989 _ five times as much as the previous March. New members in February and March amounted to double the entire number of people who joined <ORGANIZATION> NARAL </ORGANIZATION> throughout 1988. Another major beneficiary has been the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> for Women. Once the undisputed leader of the women's movement, NOW after the 1982 ERA defeat was just one of many groups with separate interests. Its membership fell, its finances suffered and its activist, grassroots tactics were spurned in favor of an insiders' strategy of `` playing the game. But NOW has gained 18,000 members in the past few months, said president <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Yard </PERSON>. Its fiscal health has improved dramatically as a result of the abortion rights mobilization. And the march, initially scheduled to kick off a new NOW campaign for ERA, has raised its profile considerably. Many feminists acknowledge their movement had been in a slump, successful through the 1980s only in staving off threats to ground they had thought was secure. For example, women's groups were part of the broader coalition that helped defeat <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> and pass the Civil Rights Restoration Act over then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto. But for the most part, women's groups in the post-ERA movement went their separate ways. Some raised money for feminist candidates, some lobbied for family or economic bills on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NARAL </ORGANIZATION> continued its abortion rights campaign, NOW its pursuit of the ERA. Until the threat to abortion rights, `` there was n't that kind of eye on the prize that a movement needs,'' said <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissling </PERSON>, president of Catholics for a Free Choice. While acknowledging the backhanded contribution the conservative <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administrations have made to their movement, feminist leaders say they do n't consider the <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> threat a boon or a necessity. `` It has mobilized both human resources and money. It's providing energy and fuel to the movement,'' said <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichtman </PERSON>, president of the Women's Legal Defense Fund `` But it was n't a dying movement. It's an extraordinarily diverse movement with quite powerful leadership. We did n't need an attack on <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> to be a strong movement.'' NOW's moment in the spotlight cast by the massive abortion march may pass, but feminist leaders say the energy activated by the abortion threat will continue on that front and spill over to others. `` It will certainly revive the reproductive freedom movement and it will go well beyond where it's been before,'' said <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> NARAL </ORGANIZATION>. Noting the new involvement of labor unions, doctors, civil rights groups and religious groups, she said `` the coalition to preserve this right is much bigger and broader than ever before in the'70s and'80s.'' Many leaders spoke optimistically of the college students from some 450 campuses who came to the march. `` This is going to be the issue that brings them into the political process,'' said <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>. `` It's going to galvanize them to care about public policy and legal rights and civil rights. It will have a spinoff effect.'' The women also cited a renewed resolve to hold politicians accountable on a wide range of women's concerns. `` People were here for abortion because there's an immediate threat,'' said <PERSON> Lichtman </PERSON>. `` But they lobbied on Monday not just on abortion but on child care, family leave and the minimum wage. They're going to use their political chits with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' Most groups are likely to continue the present focus on abortion and family issues such as child care, which concern women on an intensely personal level. But NOW intends to renew its quest for the ERA, despite the difficulties of building steam for what is perceived as a losing issue. Yard said NOW does n't need a lot of people to build a solid legislative record at congressional hearings, the first phase of what she sees as a 10-year effort. And she said congressional passage can wait until more women are elected to the state legislatures that must ratify the amendment. While some women consider legal abortion the fundamental right women need to participate fully in society, <ORGANIZATION> Yard </ORGANIZATION> said NOW members believe the bottom line is the ERA. `` We're never going to let the ERA go,'' she said. `` We're very concerned about other issues, but at rock bottom, you have to have the equal rights amendment to protect the rights you win.''

<HEAD>Yeutter Defends Trade Agreement with Europeans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> says <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators held the line during trade talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> last week, regardless of how the final agreement is worded. Moreover, he said, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export subsidy program _ which provides reduced prices for selected commodities in certain overseas markets _ was a key factor in putting leverage into the negotiations, particularly in getting approval from the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> had balked at the earlier <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> insistence that all trade-distorting agricultural subsidies be eliminated over the long haul. The agreement reached in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> by more than 100 countries calls for a `` substantial progressive reduction'' in such subsidies. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, in an interview Monday with a group of reporters, said the Europeans objected to earlier language calling for the `` elimination'' of the subsidies and later to a modified `` ratcheting'' down of them. Asked if the final language represented backtracking on the part of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in its quest to do away with trade-distorting subsidies and other practices, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> replied: `` I do n't consider it backtracking at all.'' He maintained that there is no practical difference between `` elimination'' or `` ratcheting'' or the accepted `` substantial progressive reduction'' of subsidies, regardless of what some European leaders may feel. `` They may have their own reasons for articulating the outcome of the meeting as they have,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. `` Obviously, everyone will go home and, to some degree, at least, articulate their own interpretation in a way that fits their own particular needs.'' The accord reached in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> provides a framework for further discussions under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a four-year effort called the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Round </LOCATION> of talks to liberalize global trade. The current <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> round will conclude at the end of 1990. As part of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement, participants agreed to an overall freeze on farm supports and import barriers through 1990. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goal is to gain long-term accord on the future of agricultural trade and that the short-term agreement reached in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, while acceptable, was no big challenge for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators. Some American farm leaders, including <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleckner </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, had urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to proceed writing a new general farm bill on an assumption that little progress could be expected under the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> talks. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said he had no objection to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> proceeding with a new farm bill to replace the 1985 law that will expire next year. And <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> denied that he had favored going slow on legislation until it was clearer how the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> talks would shape up. `` Somehow that got misinterpreted ... because that's not really what I meant at all,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. `` Assuming that -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- negotiations are a success, the 1990 farm legislation will have to be modified accordingly in 1991,'' he said. `` But I never meant to indicate that we should n't have full-scale farm legislation in 1990.'' On the matter of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export subsidies used in the Export Enhancement Program, or <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said it is `` our view that we are not constrained on <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> expenditures.'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said further that he still favors <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> removing the lid on <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> spending so that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can match the unrestrained export subsidies of the Europeans. The program, he said, was a major factor in reaching the agreement in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> last week, along with aggressive negotiating and general leverage. `` In the absence of this combination of leverage _ with the <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> program providing a great deal of that leverage _ we very likely would not have an agreed framework in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> today,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. In a written statement later, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> repeated his earlier insistence that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` will continue to aggressively seek elimination of trade-distorting measures'' during the remainder of the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round. A background sheet said that in the short-term the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` in a general way'' is committed not to increase price support and protection for American farmers. Specifically, it said, `` We are committed not to intensify market access barriers or raise support prices to producers, subject to the condition that the commitment be consistent with existing legislation.'' The paper added: `` Our assessment is that this will not require us to do anything differently from what we are now doing. For 1990, our 1985 farm legislation requires cuts in some support prices.''

<HEAD>Kemp Plans Effort to Evict Drug Dealers from Public Housing Projects</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Housing and Urban Development Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> says his proposals to get drugs out of <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> housing projects can be followed in the rest of the nation, too. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> on Monday proposed actions against drugs in the federally supported housing projects of the nation's capital, including more police patrols, installing security fences and guarded entrances, and requiring photo identification cards for residents. He announced the moves as part of the federal government's drug crackdown in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, but said the proposals `` are appropriate and will be suggested'' to every public housing authority in the nation. `` I'm asking today the <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> police chief and the public housing authority of <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, along with public housing authorities around the country, to engage in those type of operations that can clear out and secure public housing projects from drug users and abusers and dealers,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. In the nation's capital, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said he would waive <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> grievance hearing requirements that can delay evictions from public housing for months. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> took steps recently to remove those requirements in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> outlined his plan at a news conference where national drug policy director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> and Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> announced a major new effort to combat drugs in the nation's capital. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said local police and public housing authorities should issue photo identification cards to residents of federally supported housing projects so that legitimate residents can be distinguished from outsiders. He said security guards would be trained and `` a better presence of public housing and city police'' would be provided. A part of the effort would be a general cleanup of projects, including removal of graffiti. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> acknowledged that many of the steps are things <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> should be doing anyway, and said many of the proposals were based on successful tests by local housing authorities at projects in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> and elsewhere. He said he would finance the anti-drug effort with existing money appropriated for public housing rehabilitation and operating subsidies. He put no price tag on the effort. `` If it's not enough, I'll ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for a supplemental'' appropriation, he said. <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assisted </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the city's public housing projects, said city housing officials were discussing <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s proposal and had no immediate response. But she said the district is already issuing photo cards to residents of high-rise projects for senior citizens. Most units for other residents are apartments or town houses, she said, and use of the cards is `` a much different issue'' for families. She said the district already has asked <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> for more money to pay for 100 additional housing guards and for more security fences. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> also will: _ Ask <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys to seize the apartments of drug dealers and return them to the public housing authorities _ Seek ways to terminate federal housing subsidies, such as <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> vouchers and housing certificates, for anyone convicted of using or selling drugs _ Attempt to reclaim vacant units sometimes used by drug dealers and abusers, and enforce housing codes and standards _ Encourage resident management of public housing projects _ Establish an anti-drug hotline to encourage residents to make confidential reports on drug-related crimes _ Encourage youth sports leagues in the projects to steer youngsters away from drugs

 President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> interrupted his North American trip to visit his ailing mentor, former President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Figueres </PERSON>. `` I come to see my friend, one of the greatest leaders that <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has ever had,'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> told reporters Monday as he entered <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dios </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in the nation's capital `` When his health failed, we realized how much <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepe </PERSON> meant to us,'' said the president, who was to later resume his trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Figueres </PERSON>, 83, has been hospitalized since Friday with a heart ailment.

<HEAD>Lead Found in Same Model Water Coolers Used by Schools</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Lead-Tanks List</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Water fountains with excessive levels of lead because of tanks lined with the toxic metal are being used at elementary and secondary schools, and more than 100 models have unhealthy levels, the government says. The exact number of coolers with the lead-lined tanks is not known, but the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> did say that more than a million other coolers are in use that have lead soldering or lead in some other form. Although the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> lacks the authority to order lead testing in schools, a law enacted last year requires states to begin a program to assist school districts in testing for lead in drinking water. Many such programs are under way. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials also said Monday they would soon issue a detailed guide for school officials on how to testfor unhealthy lead levels, and the agency listed more than 100 manufacturers' model numbers for fountains in which lead levels were found to be of concern. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it discovered the lead-lined tanks while inspecting 22 coolers provided by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. The nine with lead-lined tanks were all models like those used in schools. Those coolers, all made by <ORGANIZATION> Halsey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, mostly had lead levels of more than several hundred parts per billion, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said. In some cases, when long-standing water was tested, the level was more than 1,000 parts per billion, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> considers a lead level of 20 parts per billion in water to pose health risks especially if a child is exposed to lead poisoning from other sources as well. Lead is a toxic metal that is harmful to health even at low levels of exposure and poses increased risks to children. It can cause damage to the brain and nervous system and lead to learning disabilities, hearing impairment, and interference in the formation of red blood cells, according to the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>. `` There are a few hundred thousand children who have enough lead from other sources so when lead from drinking water is added at levels of 20 parts per billion there will be some adverse health impact,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> water contamination office, in an interview. The agency also said that three major manufacturers of school water coolers have acknowleged that more than a million coolers have some lead components _ usually lead soldering at joints. Two other companies did not reply to the inquiries and another said it manufactured no coolers with lead soldering. The agency gave no specific levels of lead in water from all the coolers cited by model numbers, but said the coolers were singled out only after levels were found to be in the unhealthy range. After the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> issues a final list of coolers with lead-lined tanks later this year, the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> intends to seek their recall by the manufacturer, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmeltzer </PERSON>, director of compliance at the commission. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials said that school water fountains likely account for only a `` very small'' part of the lead exposure that faces youngsters. In some cases it's uncertain whether the high lead levels in some model coolers was from the coolers or water pipes that feed the coolers. In addition to the nine lead-lined coolers from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> received two additional coolers with lead-lined tanks from school officials in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. The law that was passed last year also requires the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to issued detailed guidelines on how to detect lead contamination in school water systems and sets a timetable for replacing or fixing coolers that pose a health hazard because of lead contamination. The coolers cited by model number were manufactured by three companies _ <ORGANIZATION> Halsey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taylor </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> EBCO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Sunroc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said two other companies have yet to reply to inquiries on lead content in their coolers and a third said it produced no coolers with lead components.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed a bill to protect federal whistleblowers who report government waste and fraud, calling it a `` significant improvement'' over a version vetoed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The bill signed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday gives more job protection to federal employees who disclose misdeeds and mismanagement in their agencies. `` The true whistleblower is a public servant of the highest order,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at a bill-signing ceremony in the Old Executive Office Building attended by the measure's congressional sponsors. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoed a similar measure last fall. Stripped from the new version _ which was approved unanimously in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and by a voice vote in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> _ is a provision opposed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that would have permitted the Office of Special Counsel to go to court on behalf of whistleblowers. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> protested this would have resulted in federal agencies fighting court battles against each other. The new version `` addresses the chief constitutional concerns raised by earlier versions of this legislation,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` The bill I am signing today is a significant improvement over legislation enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year.'' Under the new act, employees fighting for their jobs would face less stringent standards of proof that their firing or demotion came as the result of whistleblowing. The Office of the Special Counsel, established eight years ago to investigate civil service abuses, would become an independent agency.

An Israeli government official in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> quoted <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> on Monday as saying he was willing to discuss participation in proposed elections by Palestinians from outside the territories. The official said those elected also might consult during negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, with which <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> refuses to deal, because `` no one can think the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is an element you can totally ignore.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> should `` explore practical ways to advance the peace process.''

<HEAD>New Car Average Mileage of 33 mpg Possible by 1995, Congress Told</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

 Cars could average 33 miles per gallon by 1995, but automakers are unlikely to make the necessary engineering changes on their own, the congressional <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> says. The higher average, about 5 mpg above the present one for new cars, could be reached if automakers began immediately to move available fuel-conservation technology into their cars at a more rapid pace, an analyst with the office told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on Monday. Those changes include better tires, more aerodynamic body design and engine improvements, said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON>, senior associate with the office. `` We calculate that this level of efficiency could be obtained without a performance loss or the need to move to smaller vehicles, at a cost that would be compensated for by fuel savings,'' <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON> told the oversight and investigations subcommttee, chaired by Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich. But the office `` doubts that the industry will pursue this course without a further economic or regulatory incentive to do so,'' <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> have said high fuel-economy standards are difficult to reach because of the public's demand for larger, high-powered cars. The OTA analysis struck a middle course between the positions of advocates of tighter fuel-economy standards and the major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers. Energy conservation groups have proposed a 45 mpg fuel-economy goal for cars by 2000, a level <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON> said was `` virtually impossible'' to reach. Neither <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> nor <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> could provide estimates of attainable fuel efficiency for 1995. `` We have n't gone out that far in our prognostications, largely because there are just too many variables to deal with, the largest of which is fuel cost,'' said <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>. The office's analysis assumed a $ 1.10 per gallon price for gasoline, <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON> said. The corporate average fuel economy standard requires the mix of 1989 cars sold by each automaker to average 26.5 mpg or better. The average fuel-efficiency for all new passenger cars in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1987 was 28 mpg and <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON> said the present level is about the same. Among the presently available technologies whose adoption could improve fuel efficiency are more aerodynamic styling, improved tire composition and design and improved pumps and other components, <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON> said. Greater use of front-wheel drive, four-speed automatic shift, four-cylinder and four-valve engines and low-friction rings and pistons would also help increase the average fuel efficiency of cars in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON> said. The goal likely could n't be reached if present trends toward greater performance and luxury continued, or if the industry had to comply with stricter pollution-control standards that required technologies that reduce fuel efficiency, <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON> said.

 People who called an expanded toll-free telephone service offered by the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> met with busy signals, endless waits on hold and misinformation when they did get through, witnesses told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel. <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, told the the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Aging that she was put on hold three times for 20 minutes, then told she would have to wait 30 days for the answer to a question on moving her mother's checks into a new account. A phone representative neglected to tell <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Lippert </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> that she needed to file a claim to get a widow's benefit, and she said it took five months to wade through red tape before the problem was solved `` I would like to point out that for the past five months, I have only received my own Social Security check, which is $ 70 less than my rent alone,'' she told the panel on Monday. The administration began the 800-number service last October, hoping to improve convenience and accessibility to the public by making phone representatives available for 12 hours per day, instead of eight. The system, in which calls to local Social Security offices are routed to any of 37 national `` teleservice'' centers, has been implemented so far in 60 percent of the nation and received 22 million calls. The service was touted in two mailings to a total of 36 million beneficiaries in December and February. Lawmakers began hearing about the system after national busy signal rates reached 43 percent in January, followed by 35 percent in February. The rate dipped to 9 percent in March, but only after calls dropped from 4.8 million in March to 3.4 million in February, and after <ORGANIZATION> SSA </ORGANIZATION> brought in staff members in from other offices to answer calls, a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> official testified. `` While the reassignment of staff contributed to the reduction of this busy signal rate for March, it raises questions about the impact on the operations of the field facilities,'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Delfico </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s Human Resources Division said in a prepared statement. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sturdivant </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, told the panel that <ORGANIZATION> SSA </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Dorcas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> `` has created sweatshop conditions for teleservice employees.'' `` She is pressuring employees to complete calls in an average of 200 seconds,'' he said, adding that the employees are being denied sick leave. <ORGANIZATION> SSA </ORGANIZATION> said it reduced the busy signal rate in March partly through the use of a system to reroute calls during peak calling times. `` As we have identified problems and gained experience with the system, we have been able to modify our procedures along the way in order to improve our performance,'' <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> told the panel. `` This will be the largest 800-number in the world,'' she said in a prepared text. `` I want it to be the best.'' A survey conducted by <ORGANIZATION> SSA </ORGANIZATION> in February found that 84 percent of callers interviewed were satisfied with the phone service and 98 percent thought they had been treated courteously, the administration said. <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> said the latest survey placed the system-wide accuracy rate at 94 percent. But <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Delfico </PERSON> said that an <ORGANIZATION> SSA </ORGANIZATION> study last December found that the number of incorrect 800-number responses ranged from 2.5 percent for a question on disability benefits to 22.9 percent for a question on the annual earnings test for people 70 years old and over. The service handled 22 million calls during its first six months.

 It lacked the proper equipment and dawdled when it should have been racing against the clock, but the oil-smeared `` response team'' promised to revise its contingency plan and do better next time. The Allyeska-Exxxon Response Team was the last of the 103 teams to cross the finish line in the 14th-annual Ski-to-Sea Relay near <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>. `` We were well-prepared. We had a good plan. But, darn, the thing just was n't adequate,'' team member <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nordlund </PERSON> said Monday. <PERSON> Nordlund </PERSON> said his team was neither sanctioned nor supported by <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> nor <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the companies blamed for the slow response to the Valdez oil spill. It was just coincidence that team members had crude oil on their faces and clothes, he said. In fact, all but one of the team members work for the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, which is no stranger to oil companies. Each team included a downhill skier, who began the relay at the top of the <ORGANIZATION> Eaglecrest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ski </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> and passed the baton to a cross-country skier, two runners and a bicyclist. <PERSON> Nordlund </PERSON>, a legislative aide, noted his bicycle was not designed for the job. `` We thought it was a state-of-the-art bike. It actually was a little small. It was n't large enough to deal with the size of the race,'' he said. `` Well, it basically was a little kid's bike.'' The downhill skier in <PERSON> Nordlund </PERSON>'s team missed all the gates, `` and unfortunately there's a penalty each time you do that,'' he said. `` I think she skied part of the way backwards.'' Things got worse when the team's cross-country skier took over. `` He's our lawyer and he was dressed up in a suit and tie, smoking a cigar,'' <PERSON> Nordlund </PERSON> recalled. `` After the start he realized his cigar went out so he stopped and took the time to light it. `` He figured there just was n't much of a hurry. Things were under control. He had The Wall Street Journal with him and he read that.'' <PERSON> Wendie </PERSON> <PERSON> Marriott </PERSON>, who organized the weekend race as the city's recreation supervisor, said she heard that the team's runners actually ran _ backward `` The team was purposely trying to come in last, which it did,'' she observed. `` The idea was to clean up the mess at the end of the race.'' <PERSON> Nordlund </PERSON> said the team learned a lot from the experience. `` We'll do it better next time,'' he said. `` You can trust us.''

 Former President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> did n't like hearing that former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was the object of criticism by some members of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s White House. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> fired off a letter to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> saying as much. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> issued a decree that any such bad-mouthing was to cease. And the whole matter came to the attention of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who wrote <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> a note on the subject, according to <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s spokesman. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> sounded off during a recent senior staff meeting, after a <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> story quoted several current <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> officials anonymously as comparing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> unfavorably with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The comparisons focused on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s active work shedule and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s reputation for leaving detail to aides and keeping short hours. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> would not say whether the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> complaint caused <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>'s order that aides refrain from criticizing the former president. He said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> speak frequently on the phone and that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has the `` highest respect'' for the man who made him vice president. `` Most of us owe our careers'' to the former president, he said, noting that he and others, including Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, had worked in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Saddle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, confirmed that <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> had written <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> complaining about the story. `` As a matter of fact, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> dropped President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> a note last week,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Audit: Military Stuck with Millions Worth of Useless Parts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHERINE RIZZO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The military has a multimillion-dollar stockpile of useless spare parts because contractors fail to follow specifications and the government neglects to check the shipments, a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> auditor told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. A two-year audit conducted at the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> concluded an estimated $ 104 million worth of parts failed to conform `` to essential or critical operational characteristics,'' according to a report released Monday to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The report detailed problems both with the way government contractors ship out parts and the way the military accepts and pays for parts without making sure they meet rigidly drawn specifications. `` Obviously we have a lot of material out there that is not combat-ready,'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, told a hearing of the committee, which he chairs. `` I want to know why we are accepting substandard parts.'' Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> told <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> he would order spot inspections of parts as they're delivered. And Brig. Gen. <PERSON> M.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepe </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> told <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has started to equip its depots with equipment to test parts as they come in. `` It's obvious we need to do more checking,'' <PERSON> Pepe </PERSON> said. `` We had n't been doing enough checking.'' In addition, since July 1988 competitive contracts have included a one-year warranty requiring replacement or refund of substandard parts, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaaf </PERSON>, deputy inspector general for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said the audit covered spare parts chosen randomly from the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION> warehouse. About 58 percent, or $ 12.9 millon worth, of the gun parts tested in the study were unusable. Only 8 percent of examined gun parts, with such functions as feeding ammunition into 20mm and 30mm aircraft-mounted guns, conformed to specifications, the audit report said. Tests of mounted bearings, which are used in aircraft landing gears and wing flaps and on helicopter main rotor heads, indicated 38 percent conformed to specifications and 30 percent were unusable. Below-standard parts routinely were accepted and used, though the failure to conform to specifications meant they did n't last as long as they would have if they met the standards, the report said. <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaaf </PERSON> said auditors found numerous examples of contractors who shipped defective parts to one branch of the service, but other branches were n't told of the problems and gave the same contractor orders for identical or similar parts. In one case, `` one part of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> gave new work to a contractor while another part of the same <ORGANIZATION> Logistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> hauled $ 1.5 million worth of the same contractor's parts to the scrap yard,'' <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaaf </PERSON> testified.

 A natural yeast found in a beetle's stomach can neutralize deadly farm chemicals and natural toxins that sometimes are found in the nation's food supply, according two government scientists.

<NOTE>Coast Guard to Ease Seizure Rules in Drug Cases</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> is making permanent its decision not to seize vessels when only small quantities of drugs are found on board. The agency announced Monday a rulemaking that would subject the owners of commercial fishing vessels to a summons in cases when personal-use quantities of illegal drugs are found on their ships. The issuing of summonses in such cases was instituted on an interim basis Feb. 16 and the rulemaking would make that permanent, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. Before that, vessels had been subject to immediate seizure when any quantity of drugs was found. The new regulation covers commercial fishing, fish processing and fish tender vessels. Separate laws extend similar protection to ferry boats, cruise ships and other commercial vessels in cases in which a passenger brings small quantities of drugs on board. However, these vessels remain subject to seizure if there is evidence that the master or operator of the vessel was aware of the violation.

In addition, the Vietnamese government has informed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> it intends `` to repatriate 21 remains, which may be those of Americans, on April 27,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement on Monday. The investigative teams will arrive in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> on Wednesday for what will be the fifth such joint mission working with Vietnamese officials in the field. The three teams _ two comprised of investigators and one consisting of forensic scientists _ have been told they can remain in the country until April 30, making this the longest such mission ever, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> added. Previous U.S.-Vietnamese field missions were limited to 10 days each. The teams concentrate their efforts primarily on investigating geographic areas near the last known position of so-called `` discrepancy'' cases. A discrepancy case is one in which the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has reason to believe an American serviceman survived an airplane crash or hostile fire. The joint teams also attempt to investigate live-sighting reports and other claims about the fate of missing servicemen.

But <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, the wild-eyed Tennessean whose rowdiness has been embraced by country music in recent years, brought a tear to many of the 1,600 people present when he accepted his trophy. `` I'm a late bloomer, a survivor, a fighter, a contender,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` I can be a champion, but I'm nothing without all of you in this room and all the fans out there.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> then referred to his current hit record and video, the father-son duet `` Tear in My Beer,'' which uses a tape his late father made decades ago. `` The video with <PERSON> Daddy </PERSON> was the most special thing I ever did in my life,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said, choking back tears and biting his lip. Backstage, he conceded it was as emotional for him as the audience. `` When I started talking about that video I had to get off that stage because the man of steel just about lost it,'' he said.

 Two Haitian soldiers who fired their way aboard a small plane before hijacking it to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> were being questioned about their role in a recent failed coup attempt in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, authorities and witnesses said. The plane was carrying eight people, including three American missionaries, when the Fort Lauderdale-bound flight was hijacked Monday. No one was injured. Passengers said the soldiers did not threaten them and had hoped to talk to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The two were to be arraigned this afternoon on air piracy charges charges, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. Witnesses said the pair ran out waving guns and shooting in the air Monday on the tarmac at Cap Haitien airport on <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s northern coast, and forced their way onto the twin-engine <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> 402. They threw down their weapons and surrendered upon arrival at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. `` These guys were pretty upset,'' said pilot <PERSON> Duer </PERSON> <PERSON> Smedley </PERSON>. `` They were desperate to get out of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. They're not like terrorists from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. They are not looking to hurt anyone. They are just looking for a way out of the country.'' <PERSON> Guillaume </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlioze </PERSON>, 25, and <PERSON> Fadael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milord </PERSON>, 29, both of the Haitian capital <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>, were armed with a .38 - caliber revolver, an assault rifle and a 40mm anti-tank shell, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> They were questioned by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and transferred to the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said investigators were n't certain of the motive behind the hijacking, but, `` there are indications that they are against the government.'' Police sources at Cap Haitien, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the hijackers had deserted from the Dessalines Battalion. The battalion, with 750 soldiers, is one of two military units that tried to bring down Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s military president, on April 2. By Monday, <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>'s loyal 1,100-member Presidential Guard appeared to have quieted rebellious outbreaks. <PERSON> Smedley </PERSON> said the pair told him they wanted to talk to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> after they surrendered. `` I asked him where he wanted to go and he said ` <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, I have a lot of things to tell <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,''' the pilot said. `` The military has been fighting down there for the last week,'' <PERSON> Smedley </PERSON> said. `` I think these guys were just on the losing side. I got the impression that they thought if they stayed in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, they would be killed.'' Passenger <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON>, a missionary from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barrington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, said the hijack was frightening at first. `` They scared us,'' <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> said. `` But they were basically harmless. They actually expected President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to be waiting for them outside the plane.'' `` They were more scared then we were,'' said another missionary, <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kato </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kato </PERSON>, <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> and the other missionary aboard, <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON>, also of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barrington </LOCATION>, are members of the Missionary Aviation Fellowship of <LOCATION> Redlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Four Haitians also were on the flight, said fellowship spokeswoman <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> The Christian fellowship was founded in 1945 and operates 145 aircraft, primarily to fly doctors, medical supplies and missionaries to Third World countries. In October 1987, a fellowship single-engine plane was hijacked in <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION>. The pilot was held by a rebel guerrilla group before being released unharmed.

 Teacher <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>, who marked his third anniversary as a hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> today, came within 10 minutes of being released in January before something mysteriously went wrong, said his sister, <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>. `` Our hopes were highest in January and we now know that <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> was 10 minutes away from being released,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> said in a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> radio interview. `` He was clean shaven. He had fresh clothes. His hair was cut and he was ready for release.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> said that she and her sister <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillham </PERSON> were wating patiently at a hotel in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> with a plane standing by to fly them to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> as soon as they received word their brother was free. `` Then suddenly, within a split second, our hopes died,'' she said. `` We do n't know what went wrong and we still do n't know what happened.''

No one has claimed responsibility for holding him. The <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> man has dual British and Irish citizenship. Mrs. <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> also said she was bitter that the controversy over author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> may have hampered efforts to release her brother. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> broke diplomatic ties in February after <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> called for the murder of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, a British citizen, for his novel `` The Satanic Verses.''

<HEAD>Archaeologists Find Ancient City In Iraq</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Archaeologists have discovered the ruins of an ancient Mesopotamian city that flourished 4,000 years ago and rivaled <PERSON> Babylon </PERSON>. The site of Mashkan-shapir, 90 miles south of the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, has not been occupied since the city was sacked and burned about 1720 B.C. The city was identified during the first six weeks of preliminary surveys earlier this year after <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, one of the archaeologists, discovered a cuneiform inscription on a clay fragment with the name <PERSON> Mashkan </PERSON>. `` We have a whole city plan laid out there for us,'' said <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, who, with her husband, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimansky </PERSON>, identified the site in January. `` We know where the canals were, the cemetery, the palace and religious quarters, the manufacturing area and the city wall. A complete, undisturbed city _ that's what's really exciting about it as an archaeological site,'' <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said in an interview in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> today. Stone, an associate professor of archaeology at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Stony </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Zimansky </PERSON>, an assistant professor of archaeology at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said the city may rank among the region's major archaeological finds of the past four decades. Other scholars cheered the news of the discovery. `` It's always a happy day in archaeology when somewone nails down the identity of an ancient city,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallow </PERSON>, professor of Assyriology at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Some said the find could be as significant as the 1985 discovery of Tell Leilan, a northern Mesopotamian center that had been the seat of a power king in the 18th century B.C. Other archaeologists doubted that Mashkan-shapir would yield as much as <LOCATION> Ebla </LOCATION>, an ancient city in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> where voluminous archives were discovered in the 1970s and revealed a previously unknown language. Stone and <PERSON> Zimansky </PERSON> began exploring the site two years ago, collecting artifacts on the surface and examining satellite images of the routes of ancient canals that served the city. But they were barred from using aircraft to photograph the site by <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> military restrictions. So <PERSON> Zimansky </PERSON> attached a camera to a kite to obtain pictures revealing features that were not immediately visible from the ground. The city survived for 300 years as a major trading and manufacturing center with a population of 15,000. Evidence indicated that it had been built in honor of <LOCATION> Nergal </LOCATION>, the ancient Babylonian god of death, pestilence and other disasters. Stone and <PERSON> Zimansky </PERSON> plan more detailed mapping and excavation at the site next year.

<TEXT>
 Americans say newspapers should extend courtesy titles to men and women alike, using `` Mr.,'' `` Mrs.,'' `` Miss'' or `` Ms.'' on second reference, a <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll has found. Sixty-one percent in the national survey said men identified in news stories should receive the title `` Mr.'' on second reference, while 23 percent said the last name should suffice. The rest had no opinion. Similarly, 66 percent wanted a title used in second references to women. Twenty percent favored just the last name and the rest had no opinion. Among those who wanted courtesy titles for women, 63 percent said the choice of a title should depend on the woman's preference. Twenty-three percent favored using only `` Mrs.'' or `` Miss,'' and 13 percent wanted `` Ms.'' used exclusively. Of the whole survey, a 42 percent plurality favored giving women their preference of titles; 20 percent favored no titles for women; 15 percent favored using only `` Mrs.'' and `` Miss;'' another 15 percent had no opinion; and 9 percent wanted `` Ms.'' used only. The numbers are rounded. The survey was conducted March 6-15 among 1,108 randomly selected adults, and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. All identified subgroups gave majority support for using titles for men and women and plurality support for giving women their choice of titles. More young adults and blacks favored titles; better-educated and wealthier respondents were more apt to oppose them. There was little division between responses of women and men. Women were slightly more likely to favor titles for men _ 64 percent compared with 57 percent _ and two-thirds of each group supported titles for women. The choice of `` Mrs.'' or `` Miss'' only for women was more popular with older Americans; 34 percent of respondents over age 64 favored it, compared with only 14 percent of those younger than age 30. Conversely, 16 percent of the younger group favored `` Ms.,'' but just 7 percent of the oldest group agreed. Younger respondents were more apt than the oldest group to favor giving women their choice of titles, 69-57 percent, and more blacks than whites favored giving the subject her choice, 71-62 percent. More of the most-educated respondents, those who had done postgraduate work, opposed titles for either sex. A third of that group wanted no title used on second-reference to women, for example; only 8 percent of those who had not completed high school agreed. The more-educated group also was more inclined to support giving women their choice of titles. Respondents who said they read a newspaper daily _ nearly two-thirds of the total _ were a little more likely than less-frequent readers to support giving women their preference of titles, 66-58 percent. Older, wealthier and better-educated respondents were more likely to read a newspaper every day, as were Northeasterners. Liberals and women were a bit less likely to read the news daily. <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a communications company based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal, and operates TV stations <ORGANIZATION> WXFL </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, WCBD in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> WJKS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.

 This <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll is based on telephone interviews March 6-15 with 1,108 adults in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Phone numbers were selected randomly and interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recent birthday, a random phenomenon. The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample. The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that if every adult American were asked the same questions, the results theoretically would be within 3 points of the poll's results, 19 times out of 20. The error margin is larger for subgroups _ 4 points, for example, for the group that favors courtesy titles for women. There are other sources of potential error in polls, including the wording and order of questions. These are the questions in this poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100: 1. After a newspaper article has given a man's name _ say, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> _ should it then refer to him as `` Smith'' or with the title `` Mr.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>? <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>: 23 percent. Mr.: 61 percent. Do n't know or no answer: 16 percent. 2.

 A strong earthquake shook the sparsely populated <LOCATION> Kuril </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> today and was felt on the <LOCATION> Kamchatka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, Soviet officials said. There were no reports of injury or damage. The earthquake registered 6.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale and was centered in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> about 100 miles southeast of the southern tip of the peninsula, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tsumani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. It occurred at 7:58 a.m. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> time and registered between 7-8 points on the 12-point Soviet scale, said <PERSON> Yulia </PERSON> <PERSON> Krasnopeeva </PERSON>, an official at the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seismological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. That classified it as a `` very strong'' or `` destructive'' on the Soviet scale, which is based on visible physical effects. Ms. <PERSON> Krasnopeeva </PERSON> said the quake registered 4 on the Soviet scale in the city of <LOCATION> Petropavlovsk </LOCATION> about 310 miles to the north on the <LOCATION> Kamchatka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. `` There were no injuries or damage,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said in a brief report. There was no threat of a destructive Pacific-wide tsunami, or tidal wave, the warning center said. The <LOCATION> Kamchatka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> extends about 750 miles south from the Soviet mainland and divides the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> from the Sea of <LOCATION> Okhotsk </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. An earthquake of registering 6 on the scale can cause severe damage. A 7 reading is a `` major'' earthquake, capable of widespread damage.

<HEAD>Gun Amendment Stirs Up Fuss In Nebraska; High Court Steps In</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a state where two of the Wild West's sharpest shooters left their marks, judges ca n't decide whether a voter-approved constitutional amendment means that anyone can carry a gun The <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has been asked to step in and settle the dispute. Some judges in the western part of the state, where <PERSON> Buffalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cody </PERSON> had a ranch, say the statutes limiting possession of firearms are now unconstitutional because of Initiative 403, which was approved by voters last fall. Some judges in the eastern part of the state, the site of Wild <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickok </PERSON>'s first killing, have read the new constitutional language to allow for reasonable state regulation of guns. And attorneys for one man on death row have argued in federal court that the language of the amendment also outlawed the death penalty. In coming weeks, the high court will hear oral arguments in two cases that were dismissed by <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judges because of the constitutional amendment. One is against a felon accused of possessing a firearm; the other involves a man accused of having a firearm on which the serial number had been defaced. J.W. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Crofton </LOCATION>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and a backer of the initiative petition that put the amendment before voters, said the amendment was intended only to protect the lawful possession of guns. In briefs filed Monday, <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Turnbull </PERSON> said District Judges <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowlands </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> erred in tossing out the separate gun cases. The judges ruled that the amendment invalidated existing statutes regulating guns. But judges in <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which includes <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, have said the new language should be read to coexist with the regulatory statutes. <PERSON> Turnbull </PERSON> said in his brief that the intent of the amendment `` was to protect only lawful possession of firearms. Lawful possession of firearms is that which was lawful when the measure was adopted. The state may regulate the right to bear arms as a reasonable exercise of the state's police power.'' <PERSON> Turnbull </PERSON> argued that prohibiting possession of a defaced firearm, and prohibiting a felon from possessing a firearm, `` bears a reasonable relationship to promoting the public safety and is therefore a lawful exercise of the state's police power.'' Before Initiative 403 was adopted the state Constitution said: `` All persons are by nature free and independent, and have certain inherent and inalienable rights; among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.'' The amendment added a section so that the second part of the passage now reads: `` ... among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness and the right to keep and bear arms for security or defense of self, family, home and others, and for lawful common defense, hunting, recreational use, and all other lawful purposes, and such rights shall not be denied or infringed by the state or any subdivision thereof.'' Attorneys for convicted contract killer <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said they believe the language of the amendment repeals the death penalty because it cites life as an inalienable right. They have filed a lawsuit in <ORGANIZATION> Lancaster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> asking that <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s death sentence be set aside.

<TEXT>
 Investigators dug through the wreckage of a twin-engine <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> 27 aircraft today hoping to find the flight recorders that might shed light on why the plane crashed, killing all 22 people aboard. There was no immediate explanation for what caused the plane to smash into a 300-foot cliff in the wooded, mountainous area 15 miles east of <LOCATION> Valence </LOCATION> at about 9:10 p.m. Monday. Within a few hours of the crash, rescue workers had recovered the bodies of the 19 passengers and three crew members aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Uni-Air </ORGANIZATION> plane, chartered by <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aero </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, en route to <LOCATION> Valence </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. The plane broke apart from the impact, spreading wreckage over several hundred yards, police in <LOCATION> Valence </LOCATION> said. They said victims' bodies were taken to a nearby chapel for identification <LOCATION> Valence </LOCATION> is located on the <LOCATION> Rhone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, 41 miles south of <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION>. Investigators searched this morning for the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder that might reveal what happened in the final moments of the flight. Air controllers at the regional center near <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION> said the pilot reported a routine approach to the airport and no particular problems during his last contact, about eight minutes before the aircraft's scheduled arrival. They said the plane was flying at an altitude of about 3,000 feet when it disappeared from radar. There was a light fog, a ceiling of about 5,000 feet and fair visibility at the time of the crash. `` The plane passed about a dozen meters above my house and right away I knew that it would not clear the cliff,'' said a resident of the village of Barbiere adjacent to the crash site. `` Then I heard a terrifying explosion and I called the fire department,'' said the man, who declined to provide his name. On March 4, 1988, another twin-engine <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> 27 en route from <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> crashed in the countryside, killing 23 people. The final report from that investigation provided no reason for the crash.

 The man described by prosecutors as one of the nation's most powerful crime bosses pleaded guilty for the first time and cried before a federal judge as he admitted to extortion and racketeering. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> `` Fat Tony'' <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON>, the 78-year-old reputed former boss of the Genovese crime family, told the judge Monday he was guilty of trying to wrest control of a <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> sand-pit business and trying to extort $ 500,000 from its owner, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Giordano </PERSON>. <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON> already is serving a 100-year sentence for his 1986 conviction as a mob boss in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trial of the Mafia's ruling `` Commission. <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON> could be sentenced to an additional five years in prison and fined up to $ 10,000 in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> case. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> charges were warranted despite <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON>'s long prison sentence. `` The purpose of this indictment was not to increase his sentence, but to demonstrate to the citizens of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> the dangers posed by <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Nostra </PERSON>, and the degree to which the highest levels of the Mafia have infiltrated and affected their lives,'' <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, said the guilty pleas did not mean <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON> participated in the offenses. `` It was an accommodation to avoid trial,'' said <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, who pointed out that a medical condition caused by a 1981 stroke affects <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON>'s emotional state and caused him to cry at Monday's hearing Special <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronster </PERSON> said the reputed crime boss's plea shows he was involved in the allegations. `` He has pleaded guilty to the charges, I'd say that's admitting his guilt,'' <PERSON> Bronster </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Massachusetts Motorists Who Kill Deer Can Keep Meat, State Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WESTBORO, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Motorists who kill deer along <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' roads may keep the meat or donate it to their favorite charity under new state wildlife regulations. `` It seems a shame to see it just wasted,'' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a wildlife biologist in charge of the state's deer management program, said Monday before the state Division of Wildlife and Fisheries board approved the change. `` A deer can do thousands of dollars of damage to a car and the meat can provide some compensation,'' he said. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said that 600 to 700 deer are reported killed on the state's highways annually, but officials suspect the toll is three times higher. `` Some go off into the woods to die and some just end up in the trunk of the car,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bickford </PERSON>, commissioner of fisheries and wildlife. Under the new rule, the driver or a passenger could keep the venison only if they are residents of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. `` We do n't want to get involved in transporting road kills across state lines,'' said <PERSON> Ellie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the division. The change was sparked in part by the state <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>'s decision in October to stop picking up animal carcasses, leaving the problem to municipalities. <PERSON> Bickford </PERSON> said budget cuts forced police to stop the service.

 <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> is just one of many worried fishermen in the <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cafe </LOCATION>, a popular coffee shop on the waterfront of the nation's richest fishing port. Just off <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION>'s coast is a gloppy mess that could end a way of life in <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION>, which last year handled fish harvests worth more than $ 166 million. The black ooze that smothered much of Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> headed this way. And the fishermen here are not happy with <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s response to the spill that left them with a 10-million-gallon nightmare. They are holding their breath as tentacles of oil reach into fertile cod and halibut fishing grounds nearby. `` Hellfire, man, what did they do? They did n't have any equipment to do anything with anyway. This ought to wake somebody up,'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said as he puffed his cigarette down to the filter. `` They have to pass some laws to have certain things and have somebody to ride herd on them.'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, his face weather-lined and his hands dark and work-hardened, has depended on the sea for a living for 20 years. In his 52-foot boat, the <PERSON> Markayla </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON>, he harvests crab, salmon and halibut. `` Yeah, I worry about the long-term effects. We all do. I wonder what will happen.'' Another one worrying is <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, part-owner of two vessels now at sea fishing for black cod. `` It's just a tragedy,'' he said. `` A lot of the oil is on the halibut grounds and on the black cod grounds. `` Our problem is we have a big halibut season in a month. It's a 24-hour opening. If we lay the gear and have to pull it six, eight or 10 hours later because of oil, it will cost. `` And if we have one fish that's tainted ... you ca n't have one bad fish in your load,'' said <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, who has been a commercial fisherman 26 years. `` Everybody is worried what the long-term effect is. Depending on the long-term effects, it can mean your way of life is gone as a fisherman. `` It could be bad. It really could. Then, it might not be. It could affect everybody here. This is a fishing village and everything is tied to that.'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Eoff </PERSON> said he thinks cleanup officials should attack the oil before its coats <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION>'s rocky coastline. `` I feel they better do everything they can, including hiring local boats and people, and get them out there.'' But he said that may not be enough. `` In the long term, who knows? It could be years, and years and years and years of dead areas.''

 Syrian gunners today shelled a Christian army position outside <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and tension rose about a possible violent Moslem response to the expected arrival of two French ships with humanitarian aid. Police said no casualties were reported from the brief Syrian howitzer barrage against the deserted town of <LOCATION> Souk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Gharb </LOCATION>, about 15 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. A police spokesman, who can not be named in line with standing rules, said `` there was no response from the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> side to the barrage.'' Shells fired by army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s mostly Christian troops and by <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> army gunners exploded in <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> and Moslem districts on Monday, killing two people and wounding 15. That raised the toll to 180 people killed and 619 wounded since the current round of civil war fighting erupted on March 8. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> had declared a `` war of liberation'' against Syrian forces. The Syrians have responded by shelling the 310-square-mile Christian enclave. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is the country's main power broker with 40,000 troops deployed in predominantly Moslem areas covering 70 percent of Lebanese territory under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, which ruled <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> from the end of World War I until independence in 1943, has voiced concern about the fate of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Christian community and sent a special envoy in an effort to contain the crisis. The French government has not specified an arrival date for two ships carrying humanitarian aid that set sail for <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> last week, but press reports in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> said they were due Wednesday. One vessel carries fuel and food. The other is a hospital ship with beds, surgical facilities and medical supplies. There are fears the ships' arrival could trigger heavier fighting. Lebanese Moslem and leftist leaders have rejected their share of the French aid. Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> militia is <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s main ally in the current confrontation with the Christians, also warned the French ships against docking at any Christian port. The French envoy, <PERSON> Jean-Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Deniau </PERSON>, accused <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> of trying to block his mission by ordering its gunners last week to shell the French embassy in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Christian suburb of <LOCATION> Hazmiyeh </LOCATION> where he was staying. <PERSON> Deniau </PERSON>, vice president of the national assembly's foreign affairs committee, warned today that opening fire at the French ships `` would be an act of war against <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.'' The present confrontation broke out after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> ordered a blockade of militia-run ports that have been stripping the state treasury of about $ 100 million annually in taxes.

 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> today said black nationalist guerrillas did not appear to be honoring an agreement to leave <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> so the territory's transition to independence can resume. Guerrillas were to congregate at designated points so they can be escorted to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> under an agreement by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The agreement was reached in an effort to end fighting between South African-led security forces and the guerrillas in northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The bloodshed began April 1, the day a U.N.-sponsored truce was to begin as part of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s transition to independence after 74 years of South African rule. Chief Inspector Kierie du Rand of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s paramilitary police reported `` a few skirmishes'' with <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas today and Monday Du Rand put the latest death toll in the fighting at 265 guerrillas and 28 security force members. He said there was no sign that guerrillas were honoring an agreement to cross the border north to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. `` About 10 small groups of three to seven men each have crossed into <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> since Sunday, but that could be to re-supply themselves or to rest,'' du Rand said. `` There is no indication of any major movement north to the assembly points.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> says about 1,900 <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> fighters began entering <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> on April 1, violating the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agreement that calls for the guerrillas to remain at their <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> bases until mid-May. It said the incursion might have been a deliberate attempt to take advantage of the late deployment of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> monitoring force, and thus influence Namibian elections later in the year. Some Namibian observers said <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> units apparently did not know they were breaking the peace accord by entering the territory. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> contended in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> that some guerrillas had been in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> all along, and had a right to be there. On Sunday, reportedly under pressure from his Angolan and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> allies, <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> ordered his fighters to leave <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> representative <PERSON> Martti </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON> said messages were being broadcast on radio advising guerrillas to go to churches in the north as a preliminary step before reporting to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> assembly points. <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> said Monday in a radio interview with the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> that there is confusion about how to spread word of the withdrawal to his fighters. He said radio broadcasts were useless because the guerrillas had no radios. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has ruled <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> since World War I and, until last year, defied <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions demanding that it withdraw. It has agreed to a U.N.-brokered regional peace accord with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Under the agreement, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> is pulling 50,000 troops out of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, where they had fought Angolan rebels backed by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. About 100 British and Australian troops moved into northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> under the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> flag Monday to help monitor the <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> pullout. The guerrillas had until Saturday to leave but <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON>, South African administrator general in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, said the deadline might not be strictly enforced if <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> needed more time. In <LOCATION> Oshakati </LOCATION>, a military stronghold in northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, police Chief Inspector <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Brune </PERSON> said helicopter gunships were used Monday in a skirmish at <LOCATION> Ruacana </LOCATION>, near the Angolan border. `` We are not going out to look for <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> at this stage. We are giving them a chance to gather at the assembly points,'' he said. <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON> said no official cease-fire was in effect but that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> would restrain its forces. <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON> said each assembly point would be staffed by 10 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> soldiers and five monitors, and would fly blue and white <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> flags. He said other <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> personnel, monitoring the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> withdrawal in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, would escort <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> fighters to Angolan bases.

<HEAD>Army Official Says Military Strikes on Terrorists Legal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military can legally attack terrorists without violating a 1976 presidential order that bans assassinations of individuals abroad, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s top uniformed lawyer contends. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Overholt </PERSON>, the service's judge advocate general, argued in an eight-page draft memorandum that because of changes in `` the nature of the threat,'' action against terrorists can be justified on grounds of national self-defense. `` The employment of military force against a terrorist or terrorist organization to protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens or the national security of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is a legitimate exercise of the international legal right of self-defense and does not constitute assassination,'' <PERSON> Overholt </PERSON> concluded. Under that legal reasoning, a soldier who shot and killed a terrorist could not be accused of an illegal assassination. <PERSON> Overholt </PERSON>'s memorandum was disclosed Monday by the newsletter <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Week </ORGANIZATION> and confirmed by <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officials. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridges </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the service had been encouraging legal debate within the Defense and State departments, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and other agencies in hopes of producing a common definition of assassination. `` The Army is attempting to update it basic ` Law of Land Warfare' field manual, which has n't been revised since 1956,'' Bridges said. `` The existing manual has a definition for assassination, which does n't mean anything, that dates to the Hague Convention of 1907,'' he said. `` This is an attempt to define what is an assassination and what is prohibited and what is not.'' On assassination, the Hague Convention said simply: `` It is especially forbidden to kill or wound treacherously individuals belonging to the hostile nation or army.'' Bridges said <PERSON> Overholt </PERSON> circulated the memo for comment last October and that <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> attorneys are still considering it. The document noted that a prohibition against assassination will mean different things in wartime and peacetime. War, in essence, legalizes the `` killing of the enemy,'' it said. During peacetime, it added, the standards of conduct must be defined under the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charter </ORGANIZATION>, `` which recognizes the inherent right of self-defense of nations,'' and domestic laws and regulations. President <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> in 1976 signed Presidential Order 12333 banning attempts to assassinate foreign public leaders. In the intervening 13 years, `` the nature of the threat has changed, rather than the international legal right to respond to the threat,'' <PERSON> Overholt </PERSON>'s memo said. `` It is noted that the terrorist individuals or organizations envisaged as appropriate to necessitate or warrant an armed response by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces are well-financed, highly organized paramilitary structures engaged full time in the illegal use of force,'' it continued. `` The -LRB- national -RRB- right of self-defense would be appropriate to the attack of terrorist leaders or terrorist infrastructure that through their actions pose a continuing threat to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens or the national security of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` A national decision to employ military force in self-defense against a legitimate terrorist threat would not be unlike that employed in response to an overt conventional threat ...''

 The captain of a nuclear submarine that caught fire and sank pulled one last sailor through its smoke-filled hatch before plunging into icy waters and dying, reports said today. Soviet media praised the bravery of the 69 crew members, 42 of whom died when the submarine caught went down in the <LOCATION> Norwegian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> on Friday. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said Capt. First Class <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanin </PERSON> was the last person to leave the submarine when it started to sink. `` But prior to that he looked once again into the submarine's exit hatch belching out smoke One of the seamen was there,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The commander helped him to get out and only after that he dived into the icy water, swimming towards the inflatable life rafts. `` But too much energy was expended on the struggle for saving the submarine and on helping his comrades. The commander died before the very eyes of his fellow seamen,'' the agency said. Funeral services will be held Wednesday for the 42 crewmen. The government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday that only 19 bodies had been recovered. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said a short circuit likely caused the fire on board the still-unidentified submarine as it was heading to port after a long voyage. Sailors fought the blaze for hours, but several explosions apparently cracked the hull and sank the vessel, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said. Soviet officials said two of the submarine's 10 torpedoes were nuclear-tipped, but there is no danger of a radioactive release from either the torpedoes or the submarine's nuclear reactor. In a report from the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Murmansk </LOCATION>, the military newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> said planes dropped lift rafts for the sailors. The newspaper quoted Maj. <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrogradskikh </PERSON> as saying the planes could not help further, and the crew had to wait for surface ships to arrive on the scene to save them. The first ship on the scene was a fishing vessel, the <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Khlobystov </PERSON>. Three sailors who were rescued died of exposure on the after they were on board, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The 27 survivors are out of danger and will be sent next week to resorts in the southern <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The Norwegian Sea temperature was 36-37 degrees Fahrenheit, and exposure to water that temperature can be fatal after 10 minutes, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Some of the survivors were in the water for more than an hour.

 A deranged man swinging a machete-like knife on a busy street was shot to death by police after a stun gun failed to stop him.

The man, who carried no identification, swung an 18-inch knife at pedestrians and scared a passerby into dropping his briefcase and fleeing into a building before five police officers arrived, police said. One officer sprayed <PERSON> Mace </PERSON> at the man but missed his face, police said. A policeman fired two darts from a 50,000-volt stun gun, but one apparently missed and the other may have failed to penetrate his four shirts, they said. An officer shot the man twice from about three feet after he twice lunged at the policeman with the knife, <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said. The victim, who was about 6 feet tall and around 200 pounds, died an hour later, police said. Police said the man wielded a Gurkha knife with an angled steel blade and a worn wooden handle. Gurkhas are warriors from the mountains of <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> known for their ferocity in battle. Their knives can be purchased in stores in the city. Separately, police charged two men with assault and cocaine possession in a machine-gun attack on a grocery store late Monday that left six people wounded, one critically.

 A 39-year-old restaurant owner looking for bamboo shoots in a thicket found a bag containing about 100 million yen -LRB- $ 758,000 -RRB-, police said today. A police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the money may be connected with some crime because no one reported it missing, although it apparently had been in the bamboo thicket for several years. He said <PERSON> Seiei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sato </PERSON>, who owns a small shop that serves grilled meat on a stick, reported the discovery to police today. The official said about a quarter of the cash had rotted and other bills were damp and fragile. Some of the money _ all 10,000-yen bills _ was bundled with bank tape dated from 1985 to 1986. He said the bag was found in a thicket about 35 feet from a road in <LOCATION> Kawasaki </LOCATION>, just south of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Under Japanese law, <PERSON> Sato </PERSON> can have the money if no one claims it within six months.

 The government has won convictions of four Puerto Rican nationalists in a $ 7.1 million heist. But the militants' supporters claimed victory, saying the trial will help the island gain independence. The four have maintained that the trial stemming from one of the country's biggest cash heists was politically motivated. They and their lawyers vowed to appeal Monday's verdicts. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayes </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON>, who was acquitted, said prosecutors had sought to `` criminalize the pro-independence movement in our country.'' But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Twardy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said the government's case was vindicated: `` The defense put the system on trial and after nine days the jury came back with a verdict that was well reasoned and proved that the system works. The government said the five defendants participated in the Sept. 12, 1983, robbery at the <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> depot in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> to raise funds to finance terrorist acts for <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macheteros </ORGANIZATION>, a violent group seeking Puerto Rican independence. Key defendant <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> was convicted of robbery, conspiracy and transportation of stolen money, but acquitted on four weapons-related charges. <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON>'s bond was revoked and he was led from the federal courtroom by marshals as his supporters sang about revolution to the tune of the Puerto Rican national anthem. The 39-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> graduate faces up to 165 years in prison. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON> <PERSON> Negron </PERSON>, 45, a car mechanic, and <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Maldonado </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, 53, an attorney, were convicted of conspiracy and transporting stolen money from <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON> faces up to 15 years in prison and <PERSON> Maldonado </PERSON> face up to five years. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> <PERSON> Talavera </PERSON>, 32, an artist, was convicted of conspiracy and faces up to five years in prison. No sentencing date was set. Judge <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Emmet </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarie </PERSON> also revoked the bond of <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON>. After the verdicts were read, <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON> raised a clenched fist and yelled in Spanish, `` The imperial power is showing how small it is.'' Ayes, a 29-year-old anthropology student, was acquitted of conspiracy. The 5 -LCB- - month trial had been delayed by marathon hearings on the admissibility of <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> tape recordings and other evidence, which in turn triggered a debate over record pretrial detentions of some defendants <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON> was held without bail for 2 -LCB- years before a judge ordered him released on $ 1 million bond in February 1988. His attorney, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinglass </PERSON>, called the verdict a sham because the jury convicted <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON> of robbery while acquitting him of robbery with use of a weapon. `` The jurors were divided, and so they split it down the middle. That's a compromise. The verdict should be set aside,'' he said. The 12 jurors' identities were kept secret and the panel was bused to the court from outside the city. The other defendants claimed they were the victims of mistaken identity and were prosecuted for legitimate activities for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Macheteros </LOCATION>, which means machete wielders. `` There are a lot of errors and it was a slim case,'' said <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Backiel </PERSON>. `` Because he was a Puerto Rican patriot, he never expected justice and he wo n't ask for mercy.'' <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON>, and two other supporters were arrested later for blocking traffic outside the courthouse. `` As long as <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> is still a colony we have a moral obligation to fight for the independence of our country by whatever means are available,'' said Ayes, who said he would return to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. `` All Puerto Ricans are Macheteros.'' <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrera </PERSON>, a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Repression </ORGANIZATION>, considered the trial a victory because publicity surrounding the case made Americans more aware of Puerto Ricans' `` struggle to be free and determine their fate. <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON> acknowledged he knew about plans for the robbery and received the stolen money to finance <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Macheteros </LOCATION>. But he steadfastly denied helping plan or execute the robbery. Prosecutors contended that <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Macheteros </LOCATION> recruited <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> guard <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerena </PERSON> to carry out the robbery, then helped him escape to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, where he is believed to be living. The government presented 110 witnesses and more than 700 pieces of evidence, including tape-recorded conversations and documents seized from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Macheteros </LOCATION> members. Prosecutors presented evidence that <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Macheteros </LOCATION> was desperate for money in 1983 and put <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON> in charge of getting funds. About $ 80,000 in what was believed to be stolen money was seized by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> on Aug. 30, 1985, when 13 suspects were arrested. The government contends that <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macheteros </ORGANIZATION> spent about $ 1 million, moved more than $ 2 million to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and squirreled away about $ 4 million in safety deposit boxes, certificates of deposit, savings accounts and farmhouse cellars in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. Two other defendants pleaded guilty to reduced charges before the trial began. Nine others await trial.

 The container holding heavy water and an electrode resembled a high school chemistry experiment. Only the beeps of a neutron counter showed that nuclear fusion might really be happening at room temperature. `` There's no question it's fusion,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Livesay </PERSON>, a metallurgist who worked on the project at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> here. `` I still do n't believe it, even though I see it.'' Researchers at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> and at <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, on Monday announced the results of separate experiments that they said appeared to confirm a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> experiment that aroused tremendous skepticism when it was announced last month. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahaffey </PERSON>, a senior researcher at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION>, said the school's experiment began detecting the release of subatomic neutron particles last weekend, a sure sign of fusion. `` It's open season on fusion,'' <PERSON> Mahaffey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> chemistry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION>, said he was elated and relieved by the announcements. He and a colleague, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southampton </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, sent scientists around the world scrambling with their March 23 announcement of a controlled fusion reaction. `` This is just incredible,'' <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` If they indeed have measured the neutron production, that's a real breakthrough. My sincere congratulations to <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION>.'' Nuclear fusion _ the melding together of two atoms with an accompanying release of energy _ normally requires enormously high temperatures. It is the energy source of the sun and hydrogen bombs. Scientists have sought for decades to harness fusion's power because it holds the potential to provide an almost unlimited supply of relatively clean, cheap energy. Unlike nuclear reactors that use fission _ the splitting of atoms _ to derive power, fusion does n't generate significant radioactive waste. In the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> experiment, which was kept behind lead shielding, probes that normally measure 40 neutrons an hour in background radiation were measuring 600 an hour. <PERSON> Mahaffey </PERSON> cautioned that his team had not confirmed whether the process produces more energy than it consumes. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M researchers said their experiment generated a net 1.144 watts of energy in the form of heat. They did n't measure neutrons. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> researchers believed the output was the result of fusion but said they were n't ready to rule out the possibility that a chemical reaction was the cause. `` This is a very unusual result, and we have not totally dismissed the possibility of some unusual chemical process which we might have not accounted for and we are currently exploring this possibility further,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, an electro-chemist at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; M. As in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, both the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> researchers used a palladium electrode to pass electric current through heavy water, a form of water that contains a heavy isotope of hydrogen. The <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> researchers said they cut the time needed for the palladium to soak in heavy water by first baking it in a vacuum. `` There is a need for much more money for research in this area if it is going to get the attention it deserves,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. `` But that's not surprising since this did n't exist two weeks ago.''

 The Confederate Home for Women, where eight elderly daughters of Civil War soldiers were told they would be taken care of for life, was doomed to close because of dwindling financial support, its chairman said. <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Burhans </PERSON>, president and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Managers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Needy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday she was too embarrassed to say how much money remained in the trust fund that supports the home and women. The women, ages 84 to 98, will be moved to more modern quarters 20 miles outside of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> to make way for the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Museum of Fine Arts. The two-story building is nestled among the magnolias behind the museum. Once the women are moved, the antiques filling the home will be sold and the museum will move in. The women had signed over their belongings and any future inheritances in exchange for their support at the home. They will lose dozens of worn but valuable antiques in use in the home. In exchange for the home, the state will pay the cost for the women to live at a suburban retirement center. Officials at the home declined requests to interview the residents on Monday. The home _ with its parquet floors, arched doorways, marble fireplace, antique furniture and portraits of Confederate heroes _ was built in 1931 and now needs extensive repairs, Ms. <PERSON> Burhans </PERSON> said. She said replacing the roof cost $ 300,000. The home also needs new plumbing and a new heating system, which would cost four times that amount, she said. `` The state was not going to appropriate the money to repair the home as a residence for eight ladies,'' she said. As many as 79 women once lived there. Not all the board members were in favor of moving the women. `` The museum wants our home,'' said board member <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliff </PERSON>. `` They want it so bad. `` They've been like damn vultures waiting for the ladies to die so they can get it.'' Ms. <PERSON> Oliff </PERSON> said she tried unsuccessfully to persuade other board members to open the home to paying descendants of Confederate soldiers. The board also denied her proposal that a smaller home for the women be opened about eight blocks away. Ms. <PERSON> Burhans </PERSON> said watching the women leave will be hard. They will be taken to see a retirement home this week. `` They are very well-adjusted,'' said <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeJarnette </PERSON>, the home's administrator. The home's board is to meet Thursday to decide where the women will go, Ms. <PERSON> Burhans </PERSON> said.

 Voters in the town where Wild <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickok </PERSON> was gunned down in a card game were asked today to take their community back to the days of the Wild West and approve poker, blackjack and slot machines. Under an amendment to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> Constitution last year, gambling limited to $ 5 bets will be allowed if 60 percent of Deadwood voters approve it. Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> predicted gambling would attract at least 200,000 additional tourists a year.

A recent telephone survey of 900 of Deadwood's 1,200 registered voters confirmed widespread support for legalized gambling, the mayor said.

 A jury resumed deliberating today whether three executives with a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> company took part in the bribery of a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> official in order to win a $ 24 million contract from the military. The four women and eight men weighing the case against <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnittjer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaub </PERSON> began studying the evidence at mid-afternoon on Monday, exactly a week after the trial started. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> allowed jurors to go home after they failed to reach a verdict in eight hours. All three defendants are former vice presidents at <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Newbury </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. All are charged with conspiracy, bribery and wire fraud for a scheme the government says involved paying bribes to a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> engineer in exchange for his confidential information about a $ 24 million contract to build hand-held radar equipment Kaub is also charged with two counts of making false statements. All the charges carry sentences of five years, except for bribery, which carries a 15-year penalty. The fine is $ 250,000 on each count. `` This was a case about bribery, cheating and lying _ that's exactly what it was,'' said assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronica </PERSON>, summing up the case in his closing argument The government tried to show in the trial that <PERSON> Schnittjer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kaub </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> knew a private consultant hired by <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> had paid bribes to <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> engineer. But defense attorneys depicted their clients as victims of a conspiracy perpetrated by <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, private consultants <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Savaides </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION>'s marketing representative in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Mortenson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Schnittjer </PERSON>'s attorney, said his client had `` nothing to do in that decision'' to pay <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON>, he said. `` <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnittjer </PERSON> is innocent.'' <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Savaides </PERSON> have pleaded guilty and are cooperating with the government in the first trial arising from the `` Operation Ill Wind'' investigation that began nearly three years ago. The investigation, which focused on the $ 150-billion-a-year purchasing system at the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, attracted national attention when search warrants were issued for offices coast-to-coast last June. <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, the parent company of the electronics firm, also pleaded guilty to conspiracy and making false statements. The company paid a total of $ 4.3 million in fines, penalties and damages. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuohey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kaub </PERSON>'s lawyer, said the executive was trapped without knowing it by the actions of <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> and his associates. `` This was their own conspiracy ... their conspiracy to defraud <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> and then hide the ball,'' he said, referring to <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> and his compatriots. `` My client was kept in the dark,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s attorney. But <PERSON> Aronica </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> executives were part of the scheme to defraud the government. They were responsible for agreeing to pay Parkin $ 10,000 in November 1985 to help win the radar contract. Once the contract was awarded, <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON>'s deal called for him to receive $ 150,000, a portion of which he got before Ill Wind was made public. `` But for these defendants, the grease for the skids would not have flowed,'' <PERSON> Aronica </PERSON> said. `` They aided and abetted in getting the money to <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON>,'' he said.

 The city's first black school superintendent may lose his job four years after many hailed his hiring as another step in healing racial bitterness that stemmed from court-ordered busing. The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is expected to vote whether to renew the contract of <LOCATION> Laval </LOCATION> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. Even though the committee voted 8-5 in October to rehire him, months of debate has changed some members' minds. A recent straw poll showed six opposing renewal, five favoring it and two undecided. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s detractors say he lacks leadership abilities and accuse him of not doing enough to lower the high dropout rate. Supporters of the 53-year-old <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> native say he needs more time to develop his programs and begin new ones. They also say <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> is dedicated and hard-working. The city has been rocked by racial tension and violence in the years following the 1974 desegration order. `` This is n't a racial issue, it's a competence and quality issue,'' said <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis-Mullen </PERSON>, a white member of the board. `` He's a diligent worker, but his approach is n't meeting the needs of the children of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>.'' Although the school budget has increased in four years by about $ 100 million, to $ 361 million, Mrs. <PERSON> Davis-Mullen </PERSON> said the dropout rate has gone up. `` I do n't think he has a firm grasp of the type of students we have here,'' she said. In 1972, enrollment was 96,000, 60 percent of them white. Today, there are 59,000 students, 24 percent white. School committee member <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>, who in 1985 voted against hiring <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> because of his conservative philosophies, said the superintendent deserves more of a chance. She is one of four black members on the board. `` You really ca n't get anything done changing horses in <LOCATION> midstream </LOCATION>. Just changing who it is right now is n't going to change a thing,'' she said. The system has had eight superintendents in the last 19 years. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> also is backed by members of the Vault, the nickname for a group of 25 prominent bankers and business executives interested in education and urban issues. Vault Chairman <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Hestnes </PERSON>, a lawyer, said Monday that <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s difficulties were based on the size of the school committee and its competing constituencies. `` Working with a 13-member school committee seems impossible to me,'' <PERSON> Hestnes </PERSON> said. `` It's a difficult system under the best of circumstances and he is n't in the best of circumstances.'' Two committee members met with <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> on Monday night, but declined to comment. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> also has declined to comment. He did not return telephone messages on Monday. His attorney, <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON>, said the committee was obligated to rehire him based on October's vote. Recently, at the request of the school committee, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> gave himself a report card. He gave himself high marks for dedication, for raising math and reading scores on national standardized tests and for lowering the dropout rate. Test scores have risen only marginally, and the dropout rate is in dispute. By <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s figures, fewer youngsters are quitting school. Other school system figures, however, show increasing attrition in class size between ninth grade and graduation day. The class of 1983 was 33 percent smaller than when it began; the class of'87 eroded by 40 percent. He said he could do better at sharing power and consulting with community groups and parents. But his bottom line was that he needed more time. `` The <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> public schools did n't develop problems overnight, and neither <PERSON> Laval </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> nor any other superintendent will solve them overnight,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> wrote in the assessment. He said if he kept the job, he would push his <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plan </ORGANIZATION>, which focuses on improving math and reading and giving principals and teachers more latitude. One problem he's faced in the contract negotiations has been his timing. Last fall, for example, he asked for an $ 18,000 housing allowance on top of his $ 95,000 salary. The request came at a time when school budget cuts loomed. After much criticism, he withdrew the allowance proposal. He now is asking for a three-year contract starting at $ 95,000, with future raises linked to what is given to teachers and administrators. Shortly after he was hired, he was granted his request for a $ 15,000 raise.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s security police keep files on people's political views and too often work in secret and on the margins of the law, a government report said today. The report followed the resignation Monday of <PERSON> Sune </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandstrom </PERSON>, head of the secret service since 1987. He said the government had lost confidence in him and apparently wanted a more political man in the job, rather than `` only a policeman.'' The secret service came under sharp attack after the 1986 assassination of Prime Minister Olof Palme because some security officials took part in a private hunt for a suspect. The new 215-page report urged tighter supervision of the secret service and greater documentation of its work. It was compiled over six months by <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Lidbom </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, and submitted to the government today The government ordered the report independently of the Palme scandal when the agency came under criticism for keeping political files and other issues. <PERSON> Lidbom </PERSON> confirmed that the <LOCATION> Sakerhetspolis </LOCATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> SAPO </ORGANIZATION> as the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> are known, kept files on political opinions of civil servants and citizens. In most cases, the practice is barred by the constitution. The ambassador also said <ORGANIZATION> SAPO </ORGANIZATION> may have used illegal wiretaps in some of its anti-terrorist and counterespionage operations. `` Seemingly, it has been characteristic for <ORGANIZATION> SAPO </ORGANIZATION> to conduct its work in a gray zone between the legal and illegal, the ethical and unethical,'' the report said. The disclosure of irregularities in the private operation to find Palme's killer shadowed the government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Ingvar </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> for most of last year. Several SAPO officers were enlisted in a private investigation. They were uncovered smuggling eavesdropping equipment into the country. The scandal led to the resignations of a national police chief and a justice minister. A 42-year-old man suspected in <LOCATION> Palme </LOCATION>'s killing was arrested Dec. 14. Officials have said the trial of the suspect, <PERSON> Christer </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>, will start May 29. <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> has denied he shot Palme. At a news conference today, <PERSON> Lidbom </PERSON> recommended that <PERSON> Sandstom </PERSON>'s replacement `` have broader experience'' and not necessarily come from the ranks of the national police He also said the agency should be required to gain prior approval for wiretapping from the justice chancellor or another oversight body. <PERSON> Lidbom </PERSON>, a senior member of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was a controversial choice to investigate the secret service, since he was sharply critical of SAPO in the past. He said <ORGANIZATION> SAPO </ORGANIZATION> had followed the lead of other countries' intelligence agencies in working in secret He did not name the other nations. `` It has become the practice to leave as few tracks as possible,'' he said of the agency's working methods.

 <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> used his `` good offices'' in an attempt to help Iran-Contra co-defendant <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> get a half-million dollars for renting a ship to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, the prosecutor at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial said today. <PERSON> North </PERSON> said that, acting on behalf of <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, he offered the Danish-registered ship Erria to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, which eventually turned down the offer. `` He could make for renting this ship as much as $ 500,000,'' prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> said as <PERSON> North </PERSON> took the witness stand in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for a fourth day. `` And that is totally separate from any'' situation involving `` me,'' the former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide responded. North is accused of accepting a $ 13,800 home security system from Secord free of charge. `` You are using your good offices to rent this ship,'' said <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>. `` No,'' responded North. He pointed out that the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> decided not to rent the ship, which was to have been used by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to broadcast into <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> presented messages that <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> had sent to <PERSON> North </PERSON> stating that the ship was worth more than $ 400,000. <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> said the ship had cost $ 300,000. One of the messages says <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> would charge $ 50,000 a month for risk for six months. `` Another word for risk is profit,'' said <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>. North had enlisted <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> major general, to run arms to the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. On Monday, the prosecutor questioned whether <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> had helped pay for a motor vehicle for North. <PERSON> North </PERSON> said he paid for the vehicle and other possessions by dipping into a family fund created by insurance settlements and years of yard sales, puppy sales and collecting spare change _ not the cash intended for Iran-Contra activities. <PERSON> North </PERSON> said the $ 15,000 family fund got its start in 1967 with an insurance settlement from an auto crash and he tossed spare change into the metal box bolted to the closet floor when he came home at night. `` We had a yard sale or two, and I think my wife sold some puppies,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> added. `` The change out of your pocket grew to $ 15,000 in your house?'' <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> asked. <PERSON> North </PERSON> said yes. <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> tried to show during cross-examination that <PERSON> North </PERSON> played loose with the $ 240,000 to $ 300,000 that <PERSON> North </PERSON> administered from an office safe to finance the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms initiative and aid the Nicraguan rebels. <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> suggested that <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> helped North pay for a used Chevrolet Suburban that cost $ 8,038. <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> also tried to show that <PERSON> North </PERSON> arranged for $ 200,000 in free life insurance, allowed his colleagues to make huge profits on Iran-Contra dealings, and accepted a free security fence. `` I got a lot of money from General <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> on a lot of occasions,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> said when asked whether he had gotten money from <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> on Oct. 5, 1985, the day he bought the car. North had enlisted <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> to run arms and other supplies to the Contras during a two-year ban on military aid to the rebels. The cash fund <PERSON> North </PERSON> operated out of his office safe was financed by Contra leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> and by <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, whose office was a mile or two away from the car dealership. `` This car has nothing to do with <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> or Secord, but with the fund that <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> set up in 1967,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> said firmly. The quarter of a million dollars or more he spent out of his office safe went to support the Contras and the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms initiative and `` that's what it was used for,'' North testified. <PERSON> North </PERSON> said he destroyed the ledger which tracked the money in his office safe on orders from then-CIA Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>. The order came after a Contra resupply plane was shot down in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> on Oct. 5, 1986, threatening to expose the covert operation, he said. North is accused of converting $ 4,300 from the office safe fund to his own use. `` You had gotten loose,'' <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> snapped. `` I had n't gotten loose,'' North snapped back. `` I was working my tail off.'' `` You had loosened up the standards,'' said <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>. `` You said that. I had n't,'' insisted North.

 Police said today they were holding three Jewish men in connection with a submachine gun attack in which one Palestinian was killed and three others were wounded. The announcement came shortly after police fired rubber bullets at stone throwers, wounding one in the leg, during an hourlong funeral march for the slain Palestinian. The three detainees `` are suspected of being linked to what happened yesterday'' but are not suspected of the actual shooting, <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanduri </PERSON> said. He declined to identify the men beyond saying two were from <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and one lived elsewhere in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The suspects were detained Monday night and were still in custody, <PERSON> Sanduri </PERSON> said. Mourners decried <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> during the funeral procession through the <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> compound, some shouting `` We warn the Jews: <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s army will return.'' Police opened fire after one youth smashed a window with his fist and others broke two windows with rocks. About 1,000 relatives and friends took part in the funeral march for <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Shawish </PERSON>, the 26-year-old blacksmith killed Monday when an attacker, dressed in army fatigues and believed to be an Israeli, opened fire with an Uzi submachine gun. The gunman, who escaped on foot, also wounded three other Palestinians in the attack outside the <LOCATION> Jaffa </LOCATION> Gate entrance to the Old Walled City of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. A caller claiming to represent a Jewish extremist group claimed responsibility for the shootings. Earlier today, several dozen masked <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> youths gathered at <PERSON> Shawish </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> home, waving <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags and vowing revenge against Jews. Police watched from nearby rooftops. One youth, masked with a kafiyyeh and hoisted on the shoulders of another, shouted: `` We should teach the Jews a lesson. Everything Jewish in this town should be burned. We should prove that this is <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> and teach them a lesson of what a Palestinian state means.'' Other youths shouted `` Revolution against the occupier!'' and `` We want a Palestinian state!'' One <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter taking notes was grabbed and threatened by masked youths. Another was hit in the stomach with a rock. In Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> today, most merchants shuttered their shops in a general strike called to protest Monday's shootings. A general strike today virtually closed the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where leaflets from the Moslem fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> movement urged residents to protest the deportation of more than 40 Palestinians by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> during the 16-month Palestinian uprising. In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, merchants shut their shops today to mourn a 22-year-old Palestinian who was shot to death in a clash with soldiers on Monday night. The death raised to 423 the number of Palestinians killed in the uprising. Eighteen Israelis also have died. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said four Palestinians were wounded by army gunfire during stone-throwing protests today in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, including a 90-year-old woman who was hit by a bullet in the left leg in the Shati refugee camp. Stoning protests were reported in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> and several neighboring <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> camps, but there were no reported casualties. In <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> today, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> teen-ager stabbed and wounded two Arab youths from the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, injuring one of them seriously, police said. The stabbings occurred during an argument that began when the Palestinian youths sought to park their truck and unload chickens outside a butcher shop, police spokesman <PERSON> Dalia </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilad </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the butcher's 17-year-old son threatened the Palestinians and then stabbed them. An anonymous caller telephoned reporters Monday night to claim responsibility for the shootings in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> for the Sicarites, a group named after Jewish assassins who fought the Roman forces nearly 2,000 years ago. The caller, who spoke Hebrew with a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> or North African accent, said the shootings were in retaliation for stone-throwing attacks on Jews during the Palestinian uprising. <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandouri </PERSON> said police were `` quite sure the assailant was Jewish'' but had not determined his motive. Sicarites members have asserted responsibility or been blamed for at least eight arson attacks against Israeli moderates. But they have not attacked Arabs directly and there were no known casualties in the previous incidents. Monday's shootings came as tensions ran high in the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. About 350,000 Jews and 135,000 Arabs live in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized in 1967 from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and has annexed. Police Minister <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bar-Lev </PERSON> announced Monday that some Palestinian youths would be barred from praying at one of Islam's holiest sites, the <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON> mosque in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, because of rioting there Friday During the riot by an estimated 4,000 Palestinians, rocks were thrown near the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest shrine. Twelve people were reported injured and 37 Arabs were arrested.

<HEAD>Ethics Panel Finds Probable Gift-Reporting Violations by Wright</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs 7th graf pvs, The committee, with new grafs 7-10 to update
with deliberations resuming, comment from panel members</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has concluded that Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> probably violated the chamber's rules by failing to report benefits from a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> business partner as gifts. A source familiar with the investigation said late Monday that the committee has found `` reason to believe'' that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> violated the gift-reporting rules on benefits given to him and his wife by the business associate in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to say how many instances of failure to report gifts had been identified by the panel. But the number could easily be in the dozens, because several benefits <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> received continued over a period of years and would have had to be reported on each year's financial disclosure form. Among the benefits under scrutiny are his virtually free use of a condominium in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, an $ 18,000 salary for his wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, and use of a 1979 Cadillac. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday that the committee had found about 30 instances of possible rules violations by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. `` We think it's an absurd report,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s press secretary `` We have absolutely no information along those lines.'' The committee resumed deliberations today, and senior members of the panel said they still hoped to reach some conclusions in the case this week. But neither chairman <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., nor senior Republican <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, would comment on votes taken so far `` I'm not going to judge whether the reports are premature or not premature,'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> told reporters. `` There's some truth and some misinformation about every statement we've read,'' added <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>. The panel's current deliberations are not unlike those of a grand jury. Finding `` reason to believe'' that rules have been violated would be equivalent to an indictment of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. The speaker would then have a chance to defend himself in a disciplinary hearing, the equivalent of a trial. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> reported his wife's employment with <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> on his financial disclosure forms as salary for her work. But the ethics panel's outside counsel, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, argued that the salary amounted to a gift because Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> did little work in exchange for it. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> and their wives jointly formed a small investment company called `` Mallightco'' and used it to make several investments. Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> first drew her salary directly from <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>'s development company and then from the partnership between 1981 and 1984. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> made no mention on the disclosure forms of the car or the condominium, which he now contends were simply fringe benefits from Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s employment. Remaining to be resolved are a number of more serious charges against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, including whether <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> had `` direct interest in legislation'' before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. That would make any gift worth more than $ 100 improper under <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules. Also remaining to be decided is whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> used his book, `` Reflections of a Public Man,'' as a device to evade limits on outside income. In several instances the speaker made bulk sales of the book to interest groups in lieu of accepting speaking fees. Honoraria for speeches are limited under the rules, but book royalties are not. The committee is struggling with the question of whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, in the committee's parlance, `` recharacterized'' money that was intended as a speaking fee into book income _ or whether the book sales constitute an entirely separate and permissible business deal. The ethics panel since last June has been conducting what it terms a `` preliminary inquiry'' and has spent upwards of $ 1 million on investigating <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s dealings over the past four decades. If it finds reason to believe rules were violated in any of the dozens of instances cited by its outside counsel, the panel would vote to include them in a statement of alleged violation. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> would have up to 21 days to respond. Then the committee would vote on whether to proceed to a disciplinary hearing. If the committee concludes that the allegations have been proven, it can recommend that the full House impose punishment ranging from a reprimand or denial of privileges to expulsion. If the committee finds the violations to be only `` technical,'' it may recommend no punishment. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, in recent weeks, has argued that any violations he may have committed would fall into that category.

 A fire and explosion at a <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> refinery shot flames 100 feet into the air and injured at least seven workers fighting the blaze, authorities said. The fire, which burned for four hours Monday and sent a black cloud over much of the eastern <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, cut production capacity at <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>'s second-largest <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> refinery by 25 percent, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> would not speculate on the amount of damage or predict when the refinery, which produces gasoline and jet fuel, would be back at full production. To make up the loss, <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> said it will increase shipments from its other Western refineries and from other areas, including the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> was investigating the cause of the blast. At least four workers were hospitalized in stable condition with burns or smoke inhalation, authorities said. There was no immediate word on the condition of others reported hurt. Gas oil, which is processed into gasoline, burned during the fire but did posed no danger to the public, said <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Holt </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Open Letter Asks Bush To Stop Outside Interference in Nicaragua</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some 600 international writers, scientists, religious leaders, academics and artists have signed an open letter asking President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to stop outside interference in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Signatories ask <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> not to meddle in regional peace efforts and to lift a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade embargo imposed against the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government four years ago. They suggest <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> talk directly to Nicaraguan officials. `` We believe that good faith must be translated into actions. This is the moment for you to restore direct dialogue with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' says the letter. A Spanish version was released to local and foreign journalists by President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s press office in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. An aide said the letter would be published in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> today. It was signed, among others, by <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> dancer <PERSON> Alicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Alonso </PERSON>, Spanish poet <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Alberti </PERSON>, American actor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Asner </PERSON>, Italian film director <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON>, Brazilian composer <PERSON> Chico </PERSON> <PERSON> Buarque </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Holando </PERSON> and American composer and conductor <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>. Other signatories included actress <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> and authors <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON> <PERSON> Grass </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON>. Central American nations should be allowed to `` resolve on their own their own affairs, without any foreign interference,'' the letter said. `` Peace in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> must immediately be re-established.'' To help bring peace, it said, foreign countries must support accords reached by the five <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents Feb. 14 in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. At the February summit, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> promised to institute democratic reforms and hold elections in February 1990, 10 months earlier than planned. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> also freed nearly 2,000 National Guards jailed for almost a decade since the July 1979 triumph of the Sandinista revolution. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and the presidents of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> also agreed to produce by mid-May a plan for dismantling the Nicaraguan rebel force known as the Contras. Some 11,000 Contra rebels, along with their families, have been living at border camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> since <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> cut off lethal aid to the U.S.-backed guerrillas in February 1988. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> has criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s recently announced proposal for a Contra aid package of up to $ 45 million in humanitarian aid over 10 months. The Nicaraguan leader maintains it would hurt regional peace efforts.

 Royal aide <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON>, whose letters to Princess <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> have renewed speculation her marriage is in trouble, was dropped from Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s entourage at the public premiere of a new <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> musical. But Buckingham Palace stressed in a statement that <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> had remained on duty back at <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION>, 21 miles west of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The bachelor, a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> commander, had been scheduled to accompany the queen, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>'s mother, to a charity performance Monday night of composer <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON>'s new show, `` Aspects of Love,'' in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> End </LOCATION>. As <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard investigated the theft of four of <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON>'s letters to <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> from the palace, speculation about her 15-year marriage to <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> made front-page news again today in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s royal-mad tabloids <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, a farmer and equestrian, is a former captain in The Queen's Dragoon Guards. Rumors his marriage to <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> is in trouble have circulated for years and recently the two have spent up to six months a year apart. They have two children, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>, 11, and <PERSON> Zara </PERSON>, 7. `` Dashing queen's equerry -LRB- aide -RRB- <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> is ` besotted' with Princess <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> and believes she loves him too,'' The Sun, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s largest circulation newspaper, reported today, quoting unnamed friends of <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> `` The handsome 34-year-old Naval Commander often speaks to her on the phone late at night, sometimes for more than an hour. And he meets her secretly whenever possible in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> or at country homes.'' <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>'s father-in-law, Maj. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, denied Monday that the marriage was on the rocks, and said he spoke to his son as recently as Sunday. `` He would confide in me if there was anything wrong but all the conversation was about horses,'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said. `` It's not the sort of marriage that ordinary people would understand at all _ they spend so much time away from one another. `` If people are royal, they do n't necessarily spend lots of time together ... Of course their marriage is very unusual.'' The British domestic news agency <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>, 38, and her 40-year-old husband were reunited for six hours overnight at their country mansion, <LOCATION> Gatcombe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, 90 miles west of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, after she spent a busy day fulfilling engagements in northwest <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The news agency said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> arrived home after midnight but left about 6 a.m. to go horseback riding. When she returned three hours later to prepare for engagements in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> had left the house. His business agent, <PERSON> Taryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennelick </PERSON>, said today he was somewhere in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> but gave no details. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> has become the busiest and one of the most admired member of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s royal family. As president of the Save the Children Fund charity, she travels on behalf of children in poverty-stricken and war-torn Third World countries. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> also travels widely on various business and equestrian interests. The latest speculation about the couple's marriage began after <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that it had been sent anonymously four letters stolen from <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>'s desk at Buckingham Palace. The Sun pledged not to publish the contents and said it had turned them over to <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard. After a Sunday newspaper told <ORGANIZATION> Buckingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> it was going to name the author, the palace identified <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON>. Royalty correspondent <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> wrote today in The Daily Mail `` <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> no longer have a marriage in the conventional sense.'' But <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> predicted: `` There wo n't be any announcement of a divorce ... For it is she ... who has brought back much respectability to the royal family at a time when popularity and support are on the wane ... Certainly the old guard at the palace would be appalled at the thought of another divorce within the royal family.'' Princess <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>'s aunt and the queen's only sister, was divorced in 1978 from Lord <PERSON> Snowdon </PERSON>, who has since remarried.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' unions agreed to big wage concessions with <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> but added a demand that must be resolved if the former baseball commissioner is to take control of the airline by tonight's deadline. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, must accept those changes in the $ 464 million deal if the purchase is to go forward, said sources speaking on condition of anonymity. The unions demanded that the bankruptcy court appoint a trustee to operate <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> as the airline emerges from Chapter 11, union sources said. A union legal adviser told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the demand was aimed at assuring `` speedy and orderly transition.'' `` We're more than a little concerned about what can happen while <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> is on his way out,'' the source said. An exhausted <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> told reporters outside the courthouse Monday evening, `` We have one more major bridge to cross ... and that's right here in this courthouse. That bridge must be crossed. ... There's no guarantee we will cross it.'' <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>'s deal with <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to expire at midnight. `` We have not yet seen a copy of the agreement. We understand it is very complex and we will study it,'' <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> said late Monday from the company's headquarters in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. `` There's no agreement as far as we're concerned,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Zirinsky </PERSON>, a lawyer for Eastern who attended the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> meetings. After four days of intense negotiations, <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> announced that his investor group had reached `` a historic labor partnership'' with leaders representing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>, pilots and flight attendants unions. Sources said the five-year agreement gives the unions a 30 percent share of Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> in exchange for $ 210 million in pay cuts and work-rule concessions. The accord must be ratified by rank-and-file members. <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> and other parties to the talks have declined to give details because of a gag order imposed by Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> said talks would continue today in an effort to get Eastern, the nation's seventh-largest airline, back in the air. Eastern has been largely grounded since Machinists struck March 4 and pilots and flight attendants walked out in support. The airline filed for bankruptcy protection five days later. Under the agreement, the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union would give up about $ 150 million in wage and benefit cuts or `` essentially what <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> wanted us to take before the strike,'' a union source said. The figures are smaller for other unions because after <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> bought Eastern three years ago, the pilots and flight attendants accepted pay cuts, but the Machinists did not. The pact must be approved by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s major creditors as well as <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. The agreement was reached early Monday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and participants flew rival <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s shuttle to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and continued talks at the bankruptcy courthouse in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. Lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and some of its creditors were at the courthouse meetings. Former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> also was present for some of the meetings, but he declined to identify his role. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> is a vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Carlyle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> investment firm. Union sources said <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>'s name surfaced several weeks ago as a possible candidate for the trustee position. Court-appointed examiner <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> was instrumental in forging the agreement with the unions, sources said. He had been in almost non-stop meetings with <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>'s representatives in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> since Thursday night. `` It would n't have happened without him,'' said a participant in the talks. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> gave the impression he would have `` thrown people in jail'' if they had walked out of the discussions, the source said. The agreement also would cover 11,000 non-union employees, including reservation clerks, ticket agents and clerical workers, <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> said. A representative of non-union employees, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Shore </PERSON>, said her group objected to not being represented in the talks. Eastern has said it could resume 80 percent of its pre-strike schedule within about 10 days after a final agreement is approved by all parties, although some union officials have said it could take 45 days or longer.

 Twelve long-term Jewish `` refuseniks,'' many of whom were denied exit visas on grounds they knew state secrets, have received permission to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on Soviet Jewry. They are the largest single group to be granted visas at one time since the summit meeting between former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> last December in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Included in the list are <PERSON> Aleksandr </PERSON> <PERSON> Piatetsky </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, who has waited 15 years for a visa, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Berenfeld </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, 12 years; and <PERSON> Inna </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorenshrain </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, 12 years. <PERSON> Shoshana </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardin </PERSON>, chairman of the Soviet Jewry group, said in a statement Monday: `` While we are encouraged by the resolution of the cases of so many long-term refuseniks, we regret that many who seek to emigrate are still denied their right to do so ...'' Emigration from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> last month was the highest since October 1979. Knowledge of sensitive information was given frequently in the past as a reason for denying visas to Jewish scientists or others who had been involved in government work. One of the reforms pledged by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was to ease the restriction.

 About 1,500 people evacuated when a fire and explosions at a chemical plant sent smoke billowing over their community were allowed back in their homes today after the fire burned itself out. Two firefighters were hospitalized for treatment of headaches and nausea after being exposed to fumes from the blaze Monday evening at the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Intermediates </LOCATION> plant, said county Fire Department spokeswoman <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Kidd </PERSON>. The unincorporated community of Saticoy, about 75 miles from downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, was evacuated overnight because of possibly toxic fumes. Battalion Chief <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said early today that more than 100 firefighters responded to the blaze but had to let it burn itself out rather than risk exposure to toxic chemicals. The plant blends chemicals for pharmacies. The company stocked acids, cyanide, explosive hydrogen and corrosives, including some chemicals that react with water, <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said. `` Because of the chemicals, you ca n't use water on it. The fire is burning through the roof with 75 - to 100-foot flames,'' said <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Beaumont </PERSON>, another Fire Department spokeswoman Firefighters hosed down an adjoining business and set up dikes to prevent the possibly contaminated water from reaching the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediates </ORGANIZATION> was cited last year for having larger quanitities of chemicals than allowed on the premises.

 Two hundred inmates today took 12 guards hostage at a prison west of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. About 300 police _ including several companies of riot police wearing helmuts and carrying clubs _ encircled the prison. Negotiations were under way between the deputy director and four inmates. The guards were being held in the first-floor central hall, an area that houses about 450 prisoners serving long sentences, the ministry spokesman said. The prisoners, who did not have weapons, took the guards captive at midday, the spokesman said. He spoke on condition of anonymity. An unidentified official in <LOCATION> Poissy </LOCATION> told Agence France-Presse the inmates `` offered no coherent demands and complained of disciplinary problems.'' After a dispute between a guard and inmate Monday night, the prisoners refused to resume their normal routine this morning. They later took the guards hostage, the ministry spokesman said. In November 1988, 250 inmates at the prison 23 miles west of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> occupied the central hall for 13 hours to protest `` bad conditions of detention'' before returning peacefully to their cells.

<TEXT>
 Foreign missions in <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> have urged <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, which has halted most exports and transit to this landlocked country in a border dispute, to let their diplomats have more gasoline, diplomats said Tuesday. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> closed most border checkpoints after Indo-Nepalese trade and transport treaties expired March 23, effectively imposing an economic blockage that has caused fuel, medicine and food shortages and led to rationing. On Monday, news reports in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> said the move completely shut down its nation's exports to <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, which were transported through <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. At the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, about 50 Nepalese demonstrated Monday to protest the border closings and appealed to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to reopen them. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> closed 13 of 15 checkpoints along the 1,090-mile border after the treaties expired. <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> wants two new treaties, while <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> demands a unified treaty combining transport and trade agreements. In a statement Tuesday to <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION>'s 19 diplomatic missions, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said diplomatic personnel could approach <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> for supplies for their use since <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s sanctions were aimed at the Nepalese and not foreigners residing in <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>. The diplomats made the request at a Friday meeting at the <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, said an Asian diplomat on condition of anonymity. One Western diplomat, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said the weekly government gas ration for diplomats has been reduced from 5.3 gallons per car immediately after March 23 closings to 4 gallons. Private motorists in <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION> can buy 1.6 gallons a week, and taxi drivers are allowed 15 liters. The rationing has led to long queues at filling stations. For cooking fuel, housewives have turned increasingly to <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>'s already dwindling forests because of a shortage of kerosene `` We just get a ration of three liters -LRB- 0.7 gallons -RRB- a week for a family of seven members. Do you think it would be enough to prepare the meals?'' asked one woman, <PERSON> Maya </PERSON> <PERSON> Devi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakya </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bangladesh </ORGANIZATION> news agency said more than 20,000 tons of fertilizer sold to <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> remains stockpiled in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> `` for want of transit facilities through <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>.'' The two neighbors have had friendly ties for years, but <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> has developed friendly political and economic ties with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which it borders along the Tibetan region. The <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION> government recently bought <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> arms for its 30,000-strong military and said they were needed to defend against domestic terrorist threats. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> fought a bitter border war with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1962, and relations still are strained. <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> says it can not play favorites in strategic politics and needs good relations both nations. Its trade with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> is minimal.

<TEXT>
 A grand jury will investigate whether a former detective committed perjury in testifying against <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, who was freed from prison after his 1977 murder conviction was overturned, a prosecutor says. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' attorneys have accused <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> of changing his version of <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' reaction to being arrested for the 1976 slaying of police Officer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> said Monday the allegation will be heard by a grand jury, probably in two or three weeks. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, now chief deputy constable in <LOCATION> Garland </LOCATION>, testified in December that <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> never denied shooting <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> and that <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> claimied to have had a `` blackout'' about what happened. But <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' attorneys countered that <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> stated in the 1988 documentary `` The Thin Blue Line'' that <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> had `` almost overreacted his innocence.'' `` There was no reason for him to lie on film,'' said defense attorney <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Preston </PERSON>, who asked District Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> for the grand jury review. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' conviction was questioned in `` The Thin Blue Line,'' which pointed instead to <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' accuser <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> as the killer. The <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last month threw out <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> ` conviction, ruling prosecutors suppressed evidence and allowed perjury at the 1977 <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> later dropped the charges, there was not enough evidence for a retrial.

<HEAD>Judge Authorizes County To Seize Property For `POW Style' Jail Camps</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge has authorized the sheriff to seize public or private property for `` POW-style'' camps to relieve jail overcrowding. District Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schattman </PERSON> issued the order Monday in an attempt to get the state to pay for housing its prisoners in county jails. The state is under a federal court order to keep its prisons below capacity and has refused to accept prisoners from most <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> counties, leaving local jails overcrowded with inmates who have been sentenced to state prison. County officials want to be reimbursed for housing such prisoners. <PERSON> Schattman </PERSON> instructed Sheriff <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> to `` requisition on the credit of the state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>'' any property needed for temporary jails. <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> said he believes a warehouse in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> would be a good site for a prison camp. The judge also instructed the sheriff to ask Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> to send National Guardsmen to patrol the compounds. If the governor refuses, the judge authorized the sheriff to deputize as many guards as he needs. The judge said the sheriff could set up `` however many POW camps are needed'' to relieve jail overcrowding. Ryder <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, general counsel to the governor, said state officials are awaiting a copy of the ruling before deciding what action to take. Officials said about 2,600 inmates are being held in the county jail designed for 1,970 prisoners, and 1,100 of them are awaiting transfer to state prison. The injunction resulted from a suit filed against the county by former inmate <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Markham </PERSON>, who claims he was raped and beaten by other prisoners and alleged that the assaults resulted from jail overcrowding. The judge ruled that the county jail is illegally overcrowded.

 The White House put some distance today between President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and drug policy coordinator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s criticism of <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and his handling of drug-related crime. `` We are in this to solve the drug problem, not to pick fights,'' said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> when asked if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was ready to second <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s criticism. `` This is a very serious problem that has to be worked out with the authorities that were elected and charged with dealing with these problems,'' said the presidential spokesman. Asked if the president supports <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> replied, `` Absolutely. He supports everything <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> says and does.'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said he welcomed the federal government's planned major drive on drug-related crime in the capital but rejected <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s contention that his administration's poor performance made the intervention necessary <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s plan, announced Monday, calls for construction of pre-trial detention and prison facilities, expansion of a local law enforcement task force, efforts to rid public housing of drug users and dealers, expansion of drug treatment facilities and an increase in job training programs. However, the <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> government will receive no direct funding. Instead, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said, the effort's $ 70 million to $ 80 million estimated cost will come from existing federal programs. `` I've said this as frankly as possible _ the local government has not acted in as responsible a way as it should,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. `` The plain fact is that, for too long and in too many respects, the <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> government has failed to serve its citizens.'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, who is under federal investigation for his relationships with a suspected cocaine dealer, refused to accept reporters' questions Monday, but he went on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show this morning to defend the local anti-drug effort `` The <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> government, I think, has been vigorous. We've had more people arrested than any other city in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ over 12,000 people in jail, getting longer sentences,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said. `` I think we've got to begin to attack the social causes'' of drug abuse, he said, noting cuts in federal education, job and housing programs during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. And he said the federal government needed to do a better job of stopping the importation of drugs. `` I'm like any other mayor,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said. `` We welcome all the help we can. We will fight as hard as we can ... We're going to win this war.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> became the nation's per capita murder capital last year with 372 slayings, most of them drug-related. This year, there have been 135 homicides, compared with 87 at the same time last year. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> had said Monday he was grateful for extra federal help in the drug war, but abruptly left a news conference before reporters could ask him if he had been stung by <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s comments. `` We welcome the idea of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> being a model -LRB- in the war on drugs -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said. `` We look forward to a long working relationship.'' `` We do n't feel that the city has failed in its management in this area,'' said city administrator <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, who fielded questions after the mayor's sudden departure. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> spokesman, said the mayor had staff meetings to attend and could not wait for the completion of the press conference. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said he had discussed the plans at length with <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> played down the mayor's involvement. `` I briefed Mayor <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> today by telephone,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. `` I gave him a brief outline of the whole thing, and we chatted for a few minutes.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> refused to elaborate on <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s role, but congressional and district government sources said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> had frozen the mayor out of his deliberations. `` There are normal channels you go through _ and that's <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> _ but <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> was going directly to agency heads,'' said one District government source who spoke only on condition of anonymity. `` We were told that they were not dealing with <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>,'' added a congressional source who had been briefed on the plan by <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s assistants `` They said the only person who had any credibility in this administration was -LRB- Police Chief Maurice T. -RRB- Turner.'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, who has been questioned by a federal grand jury about his ties to accused crack cocaine dealer and former city employee <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, is under fire from Democrats and Republicans alike on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats criticized <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> for his lack of coordinated plans for fighting the crime problem, while Rep. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Parris </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., has introduced legislation to give the federal government control of the city's public safety system <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s effort includes housing 250 city inmates at federal prisons, construction of a 500-bed pre-trial detention facility within one year and construction of a new 700-bed federal prison for the <LOCATION> Washington-Baltimore </LOCATION> area within two years. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> faulted the District government for failing to construct the detention facility in the three years since <ORGANIZATION> Cogress </ORGANIZATION> appropriated money for it, saying that due to the lack of space, `` thousands of people arrested for drug and other serious crimes in this city regularly go free.'' Meanwhile, a <LOCATION> Washington-area </LOCATION> drug task force will get an additional 57 investigators under the plan, including 25 <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and 11 <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agents. Five Defense Department intelligence analysts also will be assigned to the task force, which will concentrate on identifying crack distributors. On Mrch 13, the day he was sworn into office, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> had said he viewed <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as a `` test case'' to determine what federal efforts will work as he compiles a national drug control strategy. That plan is due 180 days after he took over the job. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s ties to <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> were called into question in December, when undercover police on their way to <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' hotel room to make a drug buy were abruptly called back when it was learned that the mayor was in the room with the suspect. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> has declined to discuss his dealings with <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, but has repeatedly denied using drugs. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> subsequently was arrested in early March in the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, where he is charged with selling crack cocaine to undercover agents.

<TEXT>
 Museum security workers turned away busloads of visitors from the <LOCATION> Pompidou </LOCATION> art center Tuesday for the 13th day, demanding <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>' most popular tourist attraction provide more jobs, higher wages and better benefits. About 1,200 employees working in other departments of the multifaceted center went on a 24-hour strike today in solidarity with the security workers. <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahrweiler </PERSON>, the center's new director, said their demands are `` trifling matters.'' She was more concerned about cutting costs, and said she is canceling a $ 1 million <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> retrospective. Defiant guards turned away thousands of European tourists on spring vacations who flooded the city. `` You ca n't come in. Ca n't you read the signs? We're on strike,'' said one guard at the 12-year-old center. The <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Pompidou </PERSON> center tops the Eiffel Tower as the capital's most popular attraction. Mrs. <PERSON> Ahrweiler </PERSON> said she wants to find a global solution to personnel problems. `` I'm the president of the whole center, and I want to avoid the isolation of the various departments,'' she said in a telephone interview. She was to meet today with Culture Minister <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> to discuss `` the status, career development and salary policies of all museum workers.'' The center, built in 1977 to accommodate 5,000 visitors a day, now welcomes five times that number. Mrs. <PERSON> Ahrweiler </PERSON> said she would make changes in management and cancel shows to cut costs. `` We can make substantial savings,'' she said. `` I'm stopping the <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> retrospective.'' The restrospective, organized by and now displayed at the Museum of Modern Art in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, was to run in 1990 and cost the <ORGANIZATION> Pompidou </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> nearly $ 1 million.

<TEXT>
 Voters went to the polls today with Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> so heavily favored for an unprecedented fifth term that turnout was expected to hit an all-time low. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, 71, needed to capture at least 50 percent of the votes against nine opponents to avoid a June 6 runoff for the four-year office. None of the candidates runs on a party line. The only serious challenger, freshman City Councilman <PERSON> Nate </PERSON> <PERSON> Holden </PERSON>, has accused <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> of ignoring his roots and the city's impoverished south side and favoring big business and foreign trade `` He's been in office too long,'' said <PERSON> Holden </PERSON>, who like <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> is black. `` They're not going to vote for him out of habit anymore.'' On Monday, <PERSON> City </PERSON> <PERSON> Clerk </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> predicted turnout of 25 percent to 30 percent _ `` a historical low for a mayoral election.'' Turnout figures were not immediately available this morning. But <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, the son of sharecroppers and grandson of slaves, has managed to escape responsibility for many of the city's problems, including drugs and gangs Even a current investigation of <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> by the city attorney's office for performing consulting work with two banks that do business with the city seemed to have had little effect on the mayor <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> has returned the $ 18,000 fees he was paid and called the charges politically motivated. Pollsters and would-be candidates conclude that <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, a congenial former city police lieutenant and councilman, has managed to be associated with <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' emergence as a Pacific Rim economic power and growth as a multi-ethnic cultural center. The city's population is swelling past 3 million, making it the nation's second-largest, and more than 70 languages are spoken. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s name has been carefully linked to projects such as the profitable 1984 Summer Olympics, the development of a skyscraper skyline downtown, the revamping of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, where the international terminal bears his name, and the construction of a multibillion-dollar rail-line transit system, <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION>. His stewardship has been less linked in the public mind with criminal infestation, illegal drug trafficking, street congestion, overbuilding, pollution and a failing sewage system. In a recent <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll, 65 percent surveyed said their quality of life worsened during the <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> years to the point that half have recently considered moving. However, in another Times' poll, 78 percent of Hispanics, 70 percent of whites and 68 percent of blacks had a favorable impression of the Democratic mayor. `` They -LRB- the public -RRB- are not holding him accountable for it. The drugs and the gangs are causing it. But they do n't think <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> is causing it. He's a lucky politician,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerrell </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles-based </LOCATION> political consultant who has known <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> since he was a police lieutenant in the 1950s. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, a political pollster and consultant, said a docile media and a perception that the city's problems are so huge that they appear unsolvable add to <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s aura of immunity. The other mayoral hopefuls were socialist <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Britton </PERSON>, an oil refinery worker; singer-dancer <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>; teachers <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Munoz </PERSON>; consultant <PERSON> Khushro </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghandhi </PERSON>; aerospace worker <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>; politician <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Miropol </PERSON> and political scientist <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Passi </PERSON>. Other <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> races included eight of the city council's 15 seats, city attorney, controller and school board members.

 Runaway Everglades brushfires sent thick black smoke across the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area today, prompting health warnings and an order to evacuate 700 aliens from a detention camp. `` I thought my garage was on fire this morning, the smoke was so heavy,'' said <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasher </PERSON>, who lives in suburban <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>.

With the help of members of <PERSON> Marsman </PERSON>'s old 18th Squadron and a lot of luck, <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON> finally made contact with the family in <LOCATION> Brandon </LOCATION> in 1987. The retired major mailed the ring to the <PERSON> Marsman </PERSON> family and later traveled to <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> to visit the flier's widow and son. `` Completing this has been one of the highlights of my life,'' said <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON>. `` There's no way to tell you what this has meant to me,'' <PERSON> Marsman </PERSON> said. `` I was two weeks old when his <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> bomber went down and all I knew from childhood was that he was missing in action and that's all my mother ever knew.'' <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON> said his unit was assigned to sweep through <LOCATION> Kai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in search of lingering Japanese or Australian and Dutch soldiers. `` I was given the ring by the head man of the island, who told me about this flier whose body had washed up on the beach,'' <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON> said. `` The head man asked that I find ` <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON>,' the name enscribed on the ring,'' and told him that name tags showed the flier's name was <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON> said. At the end of the war, the Dutch government did not yet have complete records and `` nobody I contacted seemed to know about Dutchmen flying into those islands.

He spotted the name <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsman </PERSON> in a book written by <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> and detailing the history of the <ORGANIZATION> 18th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION>, and wrote <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> asking help. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> contacted Dutch officials who were able to search their completed files and learned <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON>'s maiden name and that she lived in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. The elder <PERSON> Marsman </PERSON>, whose parents were in the Dutch East Indies and were captured by the Japanese, joined the <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and was sent to <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> to learn to fly B-25.

 <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> has praised <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> for its support of a family driven from their hometown in an adjacent county because three brothers were exposed to the AIDS virus. <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> on Monday presented the city a certificate praising its hospitality toward the <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> family, who settled here last year after battling town officals over an order banning the sons' attendance at public schools in <LOCATION> Arcadia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON>, 12, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, 11, and <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, 9, are hemophiliacs who doctors suspect became exposed to the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome through contaminated blood products. The Ray boys, doctors say, show no symptoms of AIDS and pose no threat to other children in a casual school environment. The boys and their parents, <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, fled <LOCATION> Arcadia </LOCATION> in 1987 when their home burned down, months after the family won a federal court order returning their sons to school despite protest of other parents. The preceding school year, school officials banned the three youngsters from attending classes because they tested positive for the AIDS virus. The family later received a $ 1.1 million settlement from the school district. The family settled in <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> in September, and have attended school since without incident. `` <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> has demonstrated that it's one of those good communities that does react to families in need ... and comes to their calling and provides opportunities for them,'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> told an audience of about 400 people.

 Anxious parents pulled 10 to 20 children out of classes after a drawing of an assault rifle and the words `` You're Dead'' were found on a school that received telephone death threats 10 days earlier. Police said the graffiti found Monday appeared to be the work of juveniles and not of the anonymous woman who made the phone threats. But officials of this rural community's school system reinstated tight security imposed after the first threats, including locked doors and police escorts for morning and afternoon bus runs. The security was a drastic change at the <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, which had an open-door policy at its three buildings serving 850 pupils in kindergarten through ninth grade. `` We have to face the fact it's probably not wise to have such freedoms,'' said schools Superintendent <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>. `` It's sad. It's really an end of an era.'' She said officials would also look into different types of security, including intercoms at doorways. `` If your child forgot a book, it used to be you could walk right in and hand it to him,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, who came to pick up her 11-year-old son Monday.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> urged skeptical Arab governments on Tuesday to withhold judgment on an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> proposal for Palestinian elections until it is developed into a more formal plan. `` This is a step-by-step process,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. `` You have to crawl before you walk.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> endorsed the proposal last week when <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> presented it to him at the White House. Subsequently, the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> rejected it outright. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration declined to take that as a final answer. `` It is not unusual in a process for different parties to stake out more extreme positions, especially at the beginning of the process,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s proposal had `` potential'' and `` there are lots of questions to explore. We plan to do so in the days and weeks ahead.'' For instance, Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> would discuss the proposal with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> during a visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> May 10-11. `` We are asking all those who are committed to peace to give us a chance to explore and develop these ideas,'' the spokeswoman said. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s proposal is to hold elections among the 1.4 million Palestinian Arabs who live under Israeli control on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. The leaders they chose would negotiate arrangements for five years of local self-rule. Afterward, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> would negotiate an overall settlement for the territories the Arabs lost in the 1967 Six-Day War. <PERSON> Clovis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> representative here, denounced the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> proposal on Monday as a device `` to buy more time for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and to diffuse the mounting pressure within the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and throughout the world as well to thwart the Palestinian uprising.'' <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> sought to find through elections `` a boneless or a toothless <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> negotiator who ratifies his conquest.''

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> House has voted to have a state song, `` <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>,'' which would make the Keystone state the 49th state to have an official tune. Only <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> would be left songless. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 135-59 for the measure Monday, sending it on to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Efforts to put one special song on the books have for years been tangled in politics as lawmakers pushed constituents' creations. State Government Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said a special committee of music educators and professionals chose `` <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'' from more than 200 selections. The process left no room for politics, he said. The song features the chorus, `` <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, may your future be filled with honor everlasting as your history.'' The two-verse ditty was written about 20 years ago by <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Khoury </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>. `` I feel great, I feel greatly honored. What can I say?'' <PERSON> Khoury </PERSON>, a retired prison administrator, said in a telephone interview. Under the legislation, <PERSON> Khoury </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> would still hold the copyright to the song as its publishers. But the state `` can use the song in any manner it sees fit,'' <PERSON> Khoury </PERSON> said. During debate, one lawmaker bellowed out a song he wrote about three years ago lamenting <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s song-less state. State Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallen </PERSON> launched into the nameless song a cappella to the cheers and applause of his fellow <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members. `` Without a song, there's no way to celebrate,'' he sang in a slightly off-key baritone. `` Without a song <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> is out of tune. Without a song, we're the off-key stone state. We've got a state dog, flower and fish and even a state bug. `` But what good is our bug, if we are unable in song it to plug.'' State Rep. <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kosinski </PERSON> said he would oppose the bill for `` <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>.'' `` In my mind, the only state song is the ` <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Polka,''' he said.

 <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> has been abducted, all 900 easy-going pounds of her, leaving her owners distraught and police hamstrung. `` We want her back,'' owner <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbanski </PERSON> said. `` We'll pay a ransom. No questions asked.''

The pig disappeared once before, wandering after her feed bucket when a gust of wind carried it off. `` We found her half a block away at a Dairy Queen, where people were feeding her ice cream,'' <PERSON> Urbanski </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The horror of the fighting in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> has sent 150,000 city residents fleeing for shelter in war-ravaged south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Many moved in with relatives. But hundreds are living in the wilderness, sleeping in their cars, in orange groves, or on the rough concrete gravel in unfinished buildings. A nine-month-pregnant woman is staying with her three children and 45 other refugees at one of the incomplete structures. They sleep on the ground without mattresses or blankets. `` I need milk to feed my children, and to give to my baby who is due any minute now,'' said <PERSON> Alliyeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Khodor </PERSON>, 24. She fled her house in southern <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on March 14, a week after the latest round of fighting erupted between Christian and allied Syrian and Druse forces around the capital. Police say at least 180 have been killed and more than 600 injured the fighting. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> are trying to ease refugees' plight with food handouts and blankets. `` So far we have been able to provide wheat, sugar, canned food and blankets,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> spokesman who refused to be identified by name. `` But our stocks are running thin.'' The influx has boosted the population of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by 30 percent, causing acute food and gas shortages, said a police spokesman who by custom is not identified by name. Spokesmen for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> force said at least 45,000 migrants are staying in the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> area of operations. The rest of the refugees, which they estimate at 150,000, have fled to areas near the southern <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> port cities of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> and Tyre. Some are trying to get back to their original homes inside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-designated `` security zone,'' along the Israel-Lebanon border which they fled during <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 1982 invasion. But Israeli military authorities and the Israeli-backed <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> right-wing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> fighters that controls the zone are refusing to allow Moslem returnees. <PERSON> Ghazi </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>, a 45-year-old taxi driver, said he has been prevented from returning to the house he left nearly nine years ago in the town of <LOCATION> Aynata </LOCATION> inside the Israeli-run enclave. `` I have since changed nine houses because they were either destroyed or burned to the ground during <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s endless wars,'' <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> said. His wife and eight children squeeze with 27 other relatives into his brother-in-law's two-room house in <LOCATION> Hosh </LOCATION> village, two miles south of Tyre. His eldest son, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON>, 15, said shrapnel almost killed him two weeks ago when a bomb crashed near the south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> tailoring shop where he worked. Most refugees are Shiite Moslems from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> who fled the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> invasions of 1978 and 1982 and bloody clashes between feuding Shiite militias. Lines of people wait outside the state's central telephone station in Tyre to call relatives left behind in the capital. The station has only two functioning lines. `` Now it's <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The hell there is unbearable. So I've come back here,'' said <PERSON> Kamleh </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabbagh </PERSON>, 42. `` But my heart is still there.'' <PERSON> Malak </PERSON> <PERSON> Kabbani </PERSON>, 45, a Sunni Moslem waiting her turn, said she left her house in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mosseitbeh </LOCATION> district mainly because water and power were cut off. `` We are used to the shelling, it does not scare us anymore. It's much more difficult without electricity and water,'' she said. <PERSON> Yohanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Haddad </PERSON>, the Roman Catholic bishop of Tyre, said only 1,500 Christians are among refugees in Tyre. But police say tens of thousands of other Christians have fled the Christian-held regions north and northeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Police say most managed to leave by small boats to open waters, where a ship took them to the southernmost border town of <LOCATION> Naqoura </LOCATION>. From there they crossed on foot to the `` security zone.''

 A prison escapee and suspected bank robber who underwent plastic surgery to look like actor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Niro </PERSON> was captured Tuesday with a large amount of cash in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, federal officials said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Litchfield </PERSON>, 40, was grabbed by agents of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which had assigned a special task force to him after he escaped last month from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penitentiary </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Leavenworth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION> `` It appears he is a creature of habit. There was no doubt he was going back to bank robbing and he would go back to a hot part of the country,'' said <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Pekarek </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshal for <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>.

 The walled <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, dotted with shrines sacred to Moslems, Jews and Christians, is the major fault line of the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict where tensions frequently burst to the surface. On Tuesday, Palestinians buried an Arab resident of the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s Moslem quarter who was shot by an Israeli dressed in army fatigues. The angry Palestinians shouted: `` Teach the Jews a lesson! Everything Jewish in this town should be burned!'' `` We are living inside a powder keg,'' said <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sublaban </PERSON>, 40, the owner of a souvenir shop in the city's Moslem quarter. `` The slightest provocation can make all the resentments erupt to the surface.'' Responsibility for the submachine gun attack Monday was claimed by a Jewish extremist group known as the Sicarites. The group, which takes its name from ancient Jewish assassins of biblical times, said it was avenging Palestinian stoning attacks on Jews. Tension in the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> rose Friday when rocks hurled by Palestinian rioters during a clash in the <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aqsa </ORGANIZATION> mosque compound fell on Jews worshipping at the adjacent Wailing Wall, the holiest site in Judaism. `` Radicalism on both the Arab and Jewish sides have sharpened the situation,'' Police Minister <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bar </PERSON> <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. `` Arabs throw rocks at the <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> and a Jew kills Arabs. There is no solution, it only heats up the conflict.'' About 17,000 Moslems and 2,000 Jews live in separate enclaves inside ancient <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s crowded square mile of narrow cobblestone alleyways, houses and shops. Enemies yet neighbors, they carry separate passports and rarely interact. `` These people will never integrate, it is not their purpose,'' Mayor <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> said recently to explain the historic divisions. `` The most we can do is try to avoid clashes of interests.'' Clashes have, however, been a hallmark of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s history. The city has been conquered about 20 times from 587 B.C., when the Babylonians exiled the Jews, to 1967 when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and the walled <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and annexed it. In addition to the Jewish shrines, Moslems also have sacred places in the <LOCATION> Holy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, including <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aqsa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mosque </ORGANIZATION>. The mosque is in the <PERSON> Haram </PERSON> <PERSON> al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, or Noble Enclossure, an area is called <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> by the Jews. <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> is the capital of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> also claim <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> as the capital of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. For Christians, the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> is a goal of pilgrims as the scene of <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s crucifixion and burial. Friday's riot at the <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aqsa </ORGANIZATION> mosque compound prompted Bar Lev to ban some Palestinians from the occupied territories from worshiping there. The move elicited angry reactions from the Waqf, the Islamic administrators of the <PERSON> Haram </PERSON> <PERSON> al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, or Noble Sancutary in Arabic. It is the third holiest site in <LOCATION> Islam </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. `` This is categorically unacceptable. It is an attack against freedom of religion,'' said <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON>. `` Bar Lev is pouring oil on the fire. The result will only be more and more fire.''

<TEXT>
 Winter wheat across the nation is in `` mostly fair'' condition, although the crop has declined in the central <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, a government report said Tuesday. `` In <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, winter wheat condition deteriorated and was mostly very poor to poor,'' the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility said. `` As fields broke dormancy, winterkill continued to become more evident. Insect and disease problems, however, were below normal.'' The facility, operated by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> departments, said the <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> crop was mostly good to fair, and in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> winter wheat was reported in mostly fair to poor condition. Conditions were reported as of the week of April 3-9. Dry soils since winter wheat was planted last fall have stunted development severely in many areas. Elsewhere in the plains region, winter wheat in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> was said to be in mostly fair condition, although winterkill became evident as the dormant crop began to green up this spring. The crop was reported mostly good to fair in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, and mostly fair to good in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, winter wheat was mostly fair to good, with some replanting in the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> crop was mostly poor, with winterkill becoming more widespread in several counties. Winter wheat was said to be in mostly good to excellent condition in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and mostly good in the Corn Belt. In the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> and Southeast, the crop was reported in mostly good to fair condition.

<HEAD>Agency Says Warped Track Caused Derailment, Blames Rail Company</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal investigators on Tuesday blamed `` inadequate track inspection and maintenance procedures'' by the <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> Northern Railroad for the derailment last summer of an <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> passenger train in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. The train, which was bound from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, derailed Aug. 5 near <LOCATION> Saco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mon. </LOCATION>, when it struck track that had been warped by temperatures near 100 degrees. The accident injured 165 people, about a dozen of them seriously. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in its report on the accident said Tuesday it was caused by shifting of track just ahead of the <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> train. The board said the shifting was caused by the intense heat, but that track conditions and the danger of such buckling should have been apparent to <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> Northern. The probable cause of the accident, said the safety board in its final report, `` was <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION>'s inadequate track inspection and maintenance procedures which resulted in a thermally induced lateral shift of the track structure in front of -LRB- the -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> train.'' The board continued that `` the lateral shift occurred when the train was closer than the 2,478 feet necessary'' to bring the train to a safe stop. The train was traveling at an authorized speed of 79 miles an hour. `` There was nothing that the engine crew could have done ... to have avoided or decreased the severity of the accident after they observed the shifted track,'' said the report. The derailment caused five of the train's cars to topple after leaving the tracks. The 12-car train was carrying 375 passengers and about a dozen crewmembers. The safety board blamed some of the injuries on `` the lack of effective restraint devices'' that caused some items to fly around inside the cars. While the board did not fault <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> for the accident, the report called on the passenger railroad to improve its training and procedures for evacuating passengers in such circumstances. The safety board also called on <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> to improve its track inspection procedures and make available to inspectors devices that could determine when excessive heat might cause track to warp.

 A fire aboard a tugboat early today briefly halted the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> barge trip of a mammoth decommissioned nuclear reactor bound for its burial site, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. The fire broke out in the tug's engine room about 3:30 a.m., when the barge carrying the reactor was just above <LOCATION> Bonneville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dam </LOCATION>, and delayed the trip for about seven hours. There were no injuries and `` at no time was there any danger of the reactor vessel going aground,'' said <PERSON> Wenday </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Knapptown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, which owns the tug. Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> said a backup tug was hooked up to the barge carrying the reactor while a third tug was dispatched from <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> said he was unsure what caused the fire aboard the <LOCATION> Clarkston </LOCATION>. Coast Guard vessels escorted the barge as it made its way upriver toward a dump at the government's <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> nuclear reservation in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. About 50 demonstrators watched from the <LOCATION> Interstate </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> at the edge of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> as the barge passed by without incident just after midnight, said Petty Officer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>. The barge headed to the <LOCATION> Hood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> for the final leg of an 8,000-mile trip from <LOCATION> Shippingport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, through the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> and up the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast. The <LOCATION> Shippingport </LOCATION> nuclear plant was shut down in 1982 and dismantled. The barge carried its 1,000-ton reactor pressure vessel. The vessel, 45 feet high and 18 feet across, was emptied of its uranium fuel and filled with concrete to keep residual radioactivity from escaping. `` People are just concerned,'' <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said at an earlier demonstration by about 20 people at an <LOCATION> Astoria </LOCATION> pier. `` We just wish it were n't happening.'' The main fear is that radioactivity from the vessel will seep into the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> from the dump site, she said. `` It's not what goes up the river that we worry about at this point so much as what's going to come down the river in leakage later,'' said <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> has said the barge's cargo is no threat to the public.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Urge Trade Actions Against Nations with Fleets Using Huge

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 House members from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> urged President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday to take trade action against nations refusing to regulate fishing fleets which use huge nets in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fishermen claim the so-called driftnets are used to illegally snare millions of salmon, while environmentalists contend the nets are responsible for killing thousands of porpoises, seals, seabirds and other marine life every year. The nets, which can stretch up to 35 miles, have been used since the early 1980s by about 700 vessels from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> to catch squid. Rep. <PERSON> Jolene </PERSON> <PERSON> Unsoeld </PERSON>, D-Wash., introduced a non-binding resolution, backed by her <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> colleagues in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> delegation and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s three Democrats in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, urging <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to impose trade sanctions if nations with such fleets refuse to `` enter into and implement adequate driftnet monitoring and enforcement agreements. `` This has been called ` biological strip-mining of the sea' and that's exactly what it is,'' <PERSON> Unsoeld </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` The driftnet fleet can lay 30,000 miles of net on any given day, catching and suffocating virtually every porpoise, seal, fish or bird that comes into contact with it. `` That's not fishing; that's indiscriminate slaughter.'' <PERSON> Unsoeld </PERSON> said the resolution `` sends an unmistakable message that we want these pirates put out of business.'' She said driftnet fleets are `` stealing'' an estimated 10,000 metric tons of salmon worth an estimated $ 21 million annually. American fishermen say the illegal salmon netting has already hurt fish runs in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. By international agreement, driftnet fishing is limited to certain areas that are supposed to be well away from salmon grounds, but <PERSON> Unsoeld </PERSON> said the regulations are ignored. Talks with the Japanese aimed at reaching an agreement to monitor the driftnet fleet and enforce various regulations broke down over the weekend. The secretary of commerce, under a 1987 law, has until June 29 to notify the president of any country failing to enter into such an agreement. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could then impose trade restrictions on imports of fish products from those countries. <PERSON> Unsoeld </PERSON> said that if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> fails to act, she and other lawmakers were prepared to introduce legislation that would require trade sanctions.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> reversed himself before <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, acknowledging he accepted $ 1 million from a company at the hub of a political scandal that has prompted calls for his resignation. Though <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> went before lawmakers seeking to clear his name in the nationally televised session, opposition leaders and some conservative analysts said he only raised more doubts. `` I'm not sure why <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> agreed to speak today,'' said <PERSON> Keiichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakamura </PERSON>, who served an an aide to former Prime Minister <PERSON> Takeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Miki </PERSON>. `` But if it was to increase the people's trust in the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, he probably did more harm than good.'' <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and his party have been battered by disclosures the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a huge publishing conglomerate, sold bargain-priced stock to prominent bureaucrats and businessmen. In all, 14 people have been arrested and three Cabinet ministers have resigned in connection with the scandal. The government's embarrassment heightened last week with several news reports that turned national attention to Recruit political donations to <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> before he became prime minister. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> told a special session of the lower house budget committee that between 1985 and 1987, he had received $ 1 million from Recruit and its subsidiaries. He said they gave the money to his political support groups in the form of donations and purchases of fund-raising party tickets. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> was finance minister and secretary-general of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> at the time. He earlier acknowledged that a former aide and a relative bought 12,000 Recruit subsidiary shares for a profit of about $ 190,000. But he denied any personal involvement. On Tuesday, he stressed the legality of the Recruit donations, which he called `` indispensible elements for vital political activities.'' <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> went on to reject opposition party assertions his administration no longer has the credibility to lead the nation. Vowing to stay in office, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said, `` At a time when distrust of politics is growing among the people, it is my responsibility to see that reform is carried out.'' Leaders of the governing party said his appearance would help put the Recruit affair into perspective and allow the government to move on to other business. `` I think -LRB- <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s explanations -RRB- should serve to distinguish -LRB- that the donations were legal -RRB- and should put a period on the criticism,'' said Chief Cabinet Secretary <PERSON> Keizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Obuchi </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Nakamura </PERSON> said not all members of the governing conservative party were persuaded. `` Opinion within the ruling party is split, but more and more people are realizing that the party just ca n't win elections with <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> as its leader,'' he said. Elections for half of the seats in the upper house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> will be held this summer. Political analysts say no clear successor is ready to take over <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s job, and the opposition acknowledges it does not control the votes needed to oust him. By acknowledging the donations, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> reversed a statement he made before lawmakers last October, when he denied receiving any Recruit funds `` whatsoever.'' `` <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> attempted to clear his name,'' <PERSON> Kanji </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawasaki </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> legislator who questioned <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, said. `` But by admitting to the flow of such large amounts of money, he has only deepened the suspicions which surround him.'' `` <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> simply lied until the truth was uncovered ... The people of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will not be satisfied,'' said <PERSON> Kawasaki </PERSON>. Recruit sold unlisted shares in a real-estate subsidiary to about 160 political, business and government officials at low prices in 1986. Buyers of the shares received handsome profits when the shares soared in value shortly after they were listed on the market. Prosecutors say Recruit was trying to influence policies of the labor and education ministries regarding the company's major activity, publishing job placement magazines. No politicians have been arrested in the scandal, but prosecutors have been reported to question several of them.

 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> troops opened checkpoints Tuesday in northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> said no guerrillas showed up to begin a withdrawal to salvage a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire and independence plan for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. Chief Inspector Kierie du Rand, a South African spokesman for the territorial police, said groups of more than 50 black nationalist insurgents were seen heading south, disobeying orders from their exiled leader to withdraw north to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> negotiated the withdrawal at the weekend to get the independence plan back on track after heavy fighting last week. Guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> are to report to U.N.-supervised assembly points or border posts and leave <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> by Saturday. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Rand </PERSON> said police trackers found evidence that only a handful of guerrillas have crossed back into <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> of an estimated 1,900 which <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> says entered <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> starting April 1. <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> has won international backing for its assertion the incursion violates a regional peace accord calling for <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> fighters to stay at bases in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> until May 15. The Namibian <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> said it received no reports of guerrillas appearing at churches and missions, which have been suggested safe gathering places. Territorial officials said the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> agreed that territorial police supervised by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers could interrogate guerrillas who report whereabouts of other insurgents and possible arms caches. Du Rand said police are concerned some guerrillas may hide their weapons, don civilian clothes and try to stay in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> said Monday in a radio interview with the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> that there is confusion about how to spread word of the withdrawal. He said guerrillas would not trust appeals from territorial authorities and most do not have radios to hear broadcasts of the withdrawal agreement. A contingent of 210 Finnish soldiers flew Tuesday into <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION> to join <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> forces monitoring the transition to independence, including elections scheduled for November. About 1,400 of the 4,650-member force has arrived. Youths in <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION>'s black township, <LOCATION> Katutura </LOCATION>, boycotted classes Tuesday to show support for guerrillas killed last week. Five of 14 schools were empty, the Education Department said. About 500 youths marched from school to school, hailing the slain guerrillas as heroes and denouncing the paramilitary police unit responsible for many of the deaths. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> has been fighting South African rule since 1966. Du Rand reported only `` a few skirmishes'' with guerrillas Monday and Tuesday.

<TEXT>
 The largest Tamil militant group Tuesday rejected a one-week cease-fire offered by President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>, who sought to end six years of ethnic violence that has claimed 12,500 lives. `` The government is only interested in getting our weapons and has not put forward anything worthwhile,'' said a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ranjan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> told reporters Monday that while troops operations were suspended, the militants should give themselves up at 228 centers across the country. He said 104 militants, all Sinhalese, had surrendered before the centers were set up. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> offered the one-week truce beginning Wednesday to both ethnic Tamil and majority Sinhalese militants. He said the military would suspend offensives against the Tamil rebels during that time. The offer was part of a peace package that included general amnesty, seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and jobs for the militants on this island off the southern coast of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. `` We will not agree to any cease-fire so long as the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> arms remain in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>,'' the rebel leader told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> had decided to withdraw some of its peacekeeping troops from <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. Spokesman <PERSON> Aftab </PERSON> <PERSON> Seth </PERSON> did not give details, saying only that a `` significant'' number would be pulled out. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> moved in 50,000 troops to disarm the Tamil militants under a July 1987 accord that aimed to end a Tamil insurgency in the northern and northeastern provinces. The <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> group refused to accept the accord because it said the pact did not meet enough of its demands for self-rule. In January, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> withdrew an estimated 3,000 soldiers, saying it did so out of respect for public wishes in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. Opponents of the 1987 accord had feared Indian troops might remain on the island indefinitely. Tamil militants in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> launched a campaign in 1983 for an independent homeland, citing discrimination by the Sinhalese in employment and education. In a backlash, Sinhalese extremists of the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> have killed more than 2,500 people since January They oppose the government's plan to grant Tamils limited autonomy. They have not reacted to the truce offer. In addition, the government had no immediate reaction to the rebels' rejection. Also Tuesday, two gunmen from Sinhalese group broke into a house outside <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> and killed <PERSON> Sarat </PERSON> <PERSON> Algama </PERSON>, the twin brother of senior military officer Brig. <PERSON> Lakshman </PERSON> <PERSON> Algama </PERSON>, officials said. Tamils, mostly Hindus, comprise 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people. Sinhalese, who are mainly Buddhists, make up 75 percent of the population and control the government and military.

 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee on Tuesday approved legislation to reimpose limits on commercials in children's TV shows and require broadcasters to inform and educate their young audiences or lose their licenses. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, on a voice vote, sent the Children's Television Practices Act to the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where it was expected to pass easily. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed the same bill last year but then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> let it die without his signature. A companion measure has been introduced in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, D-N. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has not taken a public position on the bill. Authors of the measure said it was designed to stop the `` overcommercialization'' of children's TV shows in the wake of a 1984 decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to lift limits on TV ads in shows aimed at youngsters. The FCC rules, established in 1974, had limited broadcasters to nine and a half minutes of commercials per hour in children's shows. Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., last week said some stations have increased their ads to as much as 12 minutes to 14 minutes per hour on such shows since 1984 At the same time, the average amount of advertising on adult shows is only about eight minutes per hour, said <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on telecommunications and finance. The bill orders the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> to limit ads on shows for children to 12 minutes per hour on weekdays and 10 -LCB- minutes per hour on weekends. In addition, the bill requires a TV station, before the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> can renew its license, to demonstrate it has `` served the educational and informational needs of children in its overall programming.'' <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, under questioning by Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dannemeyer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Calif </LOCATION>., acknowledged there were no hard definitions in the bill of what constituted children's programming But he said there was a `` general understanding'' that such shows are shown on Saturday mornings and in early mornings and afternoons during the week. He also said programming such as `` The Cosby Show'' and Disney-type programs could fall into the children's arena. Rep. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinaldo </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.J. </LOCATION>, who co-authored the bill with Reps. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, D-Ill., said it was a `` carefully crafted bipartisan compromise. Rep. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lent </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the committee's ranking Republican, said the bill `` provides modest but needed correction to excesses in children's TV advertising practices. It also encourages TV stations to improve their children's programming.'' The bill would be effective Jan. 1, 1990. It was adopted in cooperation with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stations </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>House Panel Approves Phased Lifting of Gas Price Controls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel approved legislation Tuesday to end 35 years of federal control of natural gas prices, a step cheered by the energy industry but criticized by some consumer groups even though decontrol could mean slightly cheaper gas for the nation's consumers. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, on a voice vote without dissent, sent the measure to the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where even its strongest critics say approval is likely. A similar measure has been introduced but not yet act on in the Senate. The legislation would complete a price decontrol process that began in 1978 with the Natural Gas Policy Act, which removed price limits on certain kinds of gas while also establishing two dozen categories of gas, each with a ceiling price. About one-third of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> natural gas currently is subject to federal price controls. The House bill, sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, D-Ind., would lift the remaining price controls as supply contracts expire or are renegotiated, with all such limits to be removed by Jan. 1, 1993 Controls would be ended immediately for gas not subject to a contract on the date of the legislation's enactment. Past efforts by the gas industry to win price-control legislation foundered on fears that prices paid by the 48 million households using natural gas would increase. Such concerns have faded. The collapse of oil prices in 1986, coupled with the effects of moves by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to liberalize the gas industry, led to falling gas prices, excess supplies and greatly increased competition. `` I think gas prices are going to fall'' if full decontrol is enacted, said Rep. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauzin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>. Any price movements are expected to be small because most of the controlled gas already sells at prices below the federally set ceilings. Industry officials contend that ending federal price regulation will stimulate production and use of natural gas without leading to higher consumer bills. `` For consumers this will mean supply and demand, not arcane government regulations, will set natural gas prices with the least expensive gas being produced first,'' <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee vote. His group represents gas producers. Some consumer organizations oppose the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> decontrol bill, although they acknowledge that lifting the price limits is not likely to mean higher consumer bills. Their main objection is that the legislation ignores other, more significant, gas issues that are having the effect of inflating home heating bills. `` This bill does nothing for consumers,'' said <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> Citizen-Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON> and other consumer advocates say <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should be tackling such related issues as the `` take-or-pay'' problem that is forcing consumers to help pay the cost of voiding high-priced supply contracts taken by pipelines in the late 1970s when, unlike today, supplies were tight and prices were rising. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration strongly supports gas decontrol, and <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> has said a liberalized gas industry is part of his overall strategy for strengthening the nation's energy base and reversing the trend toward higher energy imports. The decontrol move comes at a time of growing political and commercial support for expanding the use of natural gas, which currently accounts for about one-quarter of the country's energy supply. Gas is gaining popularity in part because it is considered more environmentally benign than oil and other fossil fuels. A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill, for example, calls for spending $ 100 million over three years to finance demonstration projects that use natural gas for mass transit and training programs for conversion of gasoline and diesel-fueled vehicles to run on natural gas. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel also approved legislation to create an independent, 11-member commission to recommend to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a comprehensive approach to cleaning up toxic and radioactive wastes at the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear weapons plants. Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> opposes that bill.

 An explosion and fire at in <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>'s huge east <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> refinery cut the plant's gasoline and jet fuel production cut by 25 percent, the company said. Monday's blast sent towering clouds of sooty smoke boiling into the sky from the 4 -LCB- - square-mile <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> plant and injured eight workers and firefighters with burns, smoke inhalation and shock Firefighters decided to allow the blaze to burn itself out and residual pockets of fuel continued burning Tuesday. The burned unit, a cracking column which separates crude oil into its various components from light fuels to heavy lubricants, produced about 10 percent of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>'s oil requirements, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> could not say if the production shortfall would cause any retail increase at the pumps in the western states, but that <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> planned to compensate by dipping into inventories and increasing production at other refineries. `` It's hard to isolate what the movement in prices ... might be; one thing we know is our costs will go up,'' he said. The company said the stricken unit could be out of commission for at least two months, but management would not speculate on repair and replacement costs. The 87-year-old plant handles 270,000 barrels of oil a day. <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> said company investigators were still trying to determine the cause of the lunch-hour eruption. The plant employs about 1,800 people. The Bay Area Air Quality Management District reported that although the smoke did not register on monitoring stations near the plant <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> might be liable for a $ 1,000 fine `` for creating a public nuisance.'' The smoke was not toxic, said <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Costa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Finucane </PERSON>, rating the smoke about as dangerous as that produced in a fireplace.

 A high-rated <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> championship basketball game helped CBS come in second in last week's Nielsens, but did n't budget <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> from No 1, even though <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Roseanne'' was the top-rated show of the week. Last year, the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> championship game was enough to give <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> a first for the week. This year, the game had a somewhat lower rating, but was still in the top 10. According to the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the top-rated shows of the week were: `` Roseanne'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, `` The Cosby Show'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Cheers'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` A Different World'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` 60 Minutes'' <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, `` <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> Championship _ <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Seton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION>'' <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, `` Golden Girls'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Empty Nest'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` L.A. Law'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and `` Murder, She Wrote'' CBS. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won the week ending April 2 with a 15.4 rating. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> had a 13.0 and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> a 12.5. For the season, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> has a 16.0, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> a 12.9 and CBS 12.6. `` Roseanne'' had the highest rating of the week, 23.3, but a lower share, 35, than `` Cosby'' with a 38. Each rating point represents 904,000 households with television. The share is a percentage of sets in use. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said the `` Cosby'' rating was lower because of the switch to daylight saving time affecting shows that are on at the beginning of prime-time when in many parts of the country it's still light outside. `` Roseanne'' is on an hour into prime time. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Columbo'' did well, coming in 12th for the week. But the bad news for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> is `` Moonlighting,'' which went on hiatus earlier this year, then moved to Sunday night where it is in the bottom 10 of the Nielsen ratings with a 6.2 and a 10 share. Only two other shows, both of them on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, rank lower: `` HeartBeat'' and `` Men.'' Three <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> shows had better ratings than `` Moonlighting.'' The Masters golf tournament ran over into prime time Sunday, pushing back CBS' schedule for almost an hour. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> won the Sunday movie battle with a repeat of `` Romancing the Stone.'' It was 15th, out-rating <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> movie, at 18th. CBS' `` Bridge to Silence,'' starring <PERSON> Marlee </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlin </PERSON> in her first speaking role, ranked 35th. The lowest-rated shows of the week were: `` Hard Time on Planet Earth,'' `` Mission Impossible,'' `` Rock' n' Roll Mom,'' `` Quantum Leap,'' `` Sesame Street: 20 and Still Counting,'' `` Great Circuses of the World,'' `` A Man Called Hawk,'' `` Moonlighting, `` HeartBeat'' and `` Men.''

 Syrian gunners shelled Christian areas Tuesday in spite of a 6-day-old truce called by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> sent an envoy to work out a distribution plan for two shiploads of French humanitarian aid. Police said the howitzer shells landed in a scattered pattern in Christian territory and no casualties were reported. They said the Christians held their fire. Moslem-Christian artillery duels began five weeks ago and developed into the worst sectarian fighting since 1985 in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war Police give the casualties, nearly all civilians, as 180 killed and 619 wounded. Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who commands the 20,000 Christians of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s army, imposed a blockade March 6 on illegal militia-run ports that deprive the government of an estimated $ 100 million a year in revenue. <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s Druse militia started shooting two days later and Syrian gunners soon joined them. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has 40,000 soldiers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kouchner </PERSON>, French minister for humanitarian assistance, arrived ahead of the two ships carrying food, fuel and medical supplies, which have caused an argument between Moslems and Christians. Moslems claim <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, from which <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> became independent in 1943, favors the Christians. The French government has expressed concern over the fate of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Christians. <PERSON> Kouchner </PERSON> spent 45 minutes with acting Premier <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who heads a Moslem cabinet that has competed with a Christian government led by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> since a political crisis began in September. <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> convened his cabinet afterward, then issued a statement saying the Moslem government rejected `` the French donation until the French stand toward the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> crisis is clarified.'' <PERSON> Kouchner </PERSON> told reporters <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> was determined to deliver the aid to `` all the Lebanese'' and would meet with several leaders to plan the distribution. He said <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> policy `` supports a political settlement in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> has warned the French not to bring the ships into a Christian port. Before meeting in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem, <PERSON> Kouchner </PERSON> conferred with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>, the Christian suburb where the presidential palace is located. By unwritten agreement since 1943, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s president is a Christian, the premier a Sunni and the parliament speaker a Shiite Moslem. The relief ships left for <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> last week. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has not said when they will arrive, but they are expected Wednesday. One carries food and fuel. The other is a hospital ship with beds, surgical facilities and medical supplies. Fear has been expressed that more fighting will accompany the ships' arrival. A <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> envoy who was in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> last week _ <PERSON> Jean-Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Deniau </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>'s foreign affairs committee _ was quoted Tuesday as saying it `` would be an act of war against <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'' to fire on the ships. `` If they fire, it is clear that they want to destroy <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' he was quoted as saying in the Tours, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nouvelle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republique </ORGANIZATION> du Centre-Ouest. <PERSON> Youssef </PERSON> <PERSON> Aridi </PERSON>, a grocer in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said: `` I think Wednesday will be a bad day. I wo n't leave home. If they shell the French, God knows what will happen.'' <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s latest government crisis began when President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s six-year term ended in September and <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> could not agree on a successor. <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> chose <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, the army comnmander, to lead an interim administration and Moslems swore allegiance to <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, the incumbent premier.

 The Soviet navy said Tuesday it plans to retrieve a nuclear submarine that sank off <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> to learn what caused the accident that killed 42 sailors. `` We consider that we must raise it,'' Vice Adm. <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargin </PERSON> said on the nightly television news program Vremya. <PERSON> Vargin </PERSON>, who is with the Soviet Baltic Fleet, said details of how to bring the submarine up from nearly 5,000 feet below the surface had not been worked out. `` The experts will deal with it,'' he said, adding that the hull was believed to be cracked but intact. The sub caught fire and sank Friday in the <LOCATION> Norwegian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, the government newspaper, has said a short circuit probably caused the fire. <PERSON> Vargin </PERSON> repeated the Soviet position that there is no danger of radiation leakage. He said the reactors were shut down before the crew evacuated and neither of the two nuclear-tipped torpedoes was armed for combat. In <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>, Norwegian officials said tests on water samples at the sub's level showed no radiation, but the <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> would not declare the zone clean until a more extensive examination late this week. Soviet media reports Tuesday said the sub commander, Capt. <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanin </PERSON>, pulled a sailor through a smoke-filled hatch, then died while trying to reach other survivors. `` He had spent all his energy saving sailors and he perished in front of his crew,'' Lt. <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaitsev </PERSON> told the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> from his hospital bed in <LOCATION> Murmansk </LOCATION>. Another crew member, Capt. <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolyada </PERSON>, said the first thing the crew did when the fire started was secure the nuclear reactor and nuclear-tipped torpedoes. Several of the 27 survivors were shown on television greeting their families and praising the courage of shipmates. One crewman, not identified, said: `` We were in the water for an hour and a half, but we never doubted that we would be rescued. There was no panic, absolutely no panic at all.'' Official media praised the bravery of the 69 crew members, 42 of whom were killed. Officials say only 19 bodies have been recovered. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the commander was the last person to leave the submarine when it started to sink and the crew could not put out the fire. `` Prior to that he looked once again into the submarine's exit hatch belching out smoke,'' it said. `` One of the seamen was there. The commander dived into the icy water, swimming toward the inflatable life rafts.'' <PERSON> Vanin </PERSON> died in the water before he could reach a raft, the agency said.

<HEAD>Government Says Treatment Makes Pigs Eat More, Get Bigger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that scientists have invented a vaccine to make pigs piggier. Pigs immunized with the experimental vaccine ate an average of 22.5 pounds more feed and gained 11 pounds more weight than pigs without the treatment, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` If a commercial product results from this venture and is approved by regulator agencies, it could mean more quality pork produced at lower cost and in less time,'' said animal physiologist <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pekas </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agency has signed a three-year cooperative agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Codon </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> biotechnology firm, for development and further testing of the vaccine. <PERSON> Pekas </PERSON>, who works at the agency's meat animal research center in Clay Center, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, said the vaccine is made partly from a fragment of cholecystokinin, a natural appetite-limiting hormone made in the upper intestinal tract of pigs and humans. When the fragment, called CCK-8, is joined to a larger foreign carrier protein, the animal's immune system recognizes the fragment as a foreign molecule and produces antibodies that block the natural CCK hormone, he said. When that happens, there is nothing to tell pigs when they've had enough to eat So they keep on eating.

 Foreign ministers from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> will try to break a deadlock in peace negotiations in a new round of talks beginning April 20 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, diplomats said Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> will mediate the talks between Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> and his Iraqi counterpart, <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>, the diplomats said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief is expected to publicly announce the date for resumption of talks Wednesday, said the diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> had previously agreed to hold a new round of direct talks in the near future at an undisclosed site near <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. No explanation was given for switching the site to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, but the change may have been made because <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> will be touring <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in late April. His itinerary has not yet been announced.

 A 45-year-old engineer accused of spying testified Tuesday that he gave sensitive documents to communist agents after one of them befriended him and gave him a job. The trial was the second involving espionage to open in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in two days. At a trial Monday in <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION>, a woman said she gave sensitive data to a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> spy because she loved him. At Tuesday's trial, <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolasch </PERSON>, who worked for an electronics firm that did military work, is charged with providing sensitive computer information on <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> jet fighters to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> intelligence service from 1973 through 1984. `` I did n't want to have anything to do with those people, I somehow got pulled into it and then feared they would pressure me if I did not cooperate,'' <PERSON> Kolasch </PERSON> told the court. `` Now I have to accept the fact that I supported the KGB. That is an enormous burden for me to bear,'' <PERSON> Kolasch </PERSON> told the court. <PERSON> Kolasch </PERSON> was arrested in March 1988, the same month as former high-ranking government secretary <PERSON> Elke </PERSON> <PERSON> Falk </PERSON>, whose trial opened Monday. Ms. <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> has acknowledged providing state secrets to the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> from 1975 to 1985. Prosecutors say <PERSON> Kolasch </PERSON> photographed documents pertaining to jets of <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> members and sold the papers to communist agents while he worked at the West German electronics firm <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION>. Among the information handed over by <PERSON> Kolasch </PERSON> were details on a sensitive aircraft electronics system he himself had developed at <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION>, prosecutors say. According to court documents, <PERSON> Kolasch </PERSON> handed over the material to contacts in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Karlsruhe </ORGANIZATION> and collected more than $ 16,200. <PERSON> Kolasch </PERSON> said Tuesday he had provided material to an East German agent using the alias <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Groth </PERSON>, whose whereabouts are unknown. The prosecution says <PERSON> Groth </PERSON> put <LOCATION> Kolasch </LOCATION> in contact with a <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> intelligence agent, whom the court said then worked as a secretary in the Soviet Consulate in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kolasch </PERSON> told the court he was a student in 1968 when he first met <PERSON> Groth </PERSON>. According to <LOCATION> Kolasch </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Groth </PERSON> gave him a part-time job with a building-cleaning company he operated at the time. He said a friendship developed. <PERSON> Kolasch </PERSON> said he began providing photographed computer information to <PERSON> Groth </PERSON> in 1973 `` because I felt obligated to him.'' `` At that time, I did n't have much money,'' <PERSON> Kolasch </PERSON> said.

 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> appealed Tuesday to a visiting Polish Cabinet minister to press for removal of a Roman Catholic Carmelite convent from the site of the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> death camp, officials said.

 Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, D-Ark., filed a formal complaint with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee Tuesday accusing <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> whip <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> of violating <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules with an unusual 1984 book promotion deal <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> listed 10 alleged violations of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules in the complaint, filed as the ethics committee discussed behind closed doors the results of a lengthy investigation of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> that was initiated by <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>. `` Mr. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> is a congressional <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, who condemns sin while committing hypocrisy,'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said. The complaint, which under <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules will force the ethics committee to vote on whether to investigate the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Republican, centers around a limited partnership created to promote `` Window of Opportunity,'' a book written by <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>; his wife, <PERSON> Marianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>. The partnership involved 21 investors who put up $ 5,000 each to promote the book, in exchange for a promise of half of the profits that normally would have accrued to the publisher. The publisher, however, ended up losing money on the book and the investors got a tax write off. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, who has denied any wrongdoing in connection with the book deal, said Tuesday that the partnership was controlled by his wife and that he was not aware of the details of the arrangement. But he said he is preparing detailed answers to 40 written questions about the book deal that have been submitted to his office by members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and reporters since the existence of the partnership was disclosed last month. Mrs. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> has acknowledged receiving less than $ 10,000 from the partnership for her work in setting up the deal and coordinating the promotional effort. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said Tuesday his wife `` resents the implication'' in <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s complaint that she was used as a conduit to funnel money to him in violation of House rules. He said she has contacted an attorney to determine if she has grounds for legal action. In addition to the promotional deal, <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said the book involved a standard royalty contract in which he and his wife each received 3 percent royalties and <ORGANIZATION> Drake </ORGANIZATION> 2 percent. But <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said the payments <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> received can not be characterized as royalties because of the unique promotional deal associated with the book. Consequently, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> argued, those payments are not exempt from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rule limiting outside earned income, as royalties are. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> also alleged that the promotional deal involved four apparent violations of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> limitations on gifts, one possible conversion of campaign funds to personal use, two possible instances of conversion of government resources to personal use, one apparent violation of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> financial disclosure rules and one apparent violation of the campaign finance law.

<TEXT>
 A public prosecutor freed Tuesday four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens detained a week ago on charges of violating laws that prohibit proselytizing, the <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. The four were freed following questioning by the prosecutor, the agency said without further explanation. An <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION> police chief, speaking on condition of anonymity, said authorities are trying to find a way to deport the four, who reportedly belong to an unidentified Christian fundamentalist group. <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> quoted officials of the prosecutor's office as saying the investigation into the case is continuing to determine whether the four should face trial. The four were detained April 4 as they distributed pamphlets protesting the portrayal of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> in the film `` The Last Temptation of Christ,'' outside a theater at the <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION> Cinema Festival. Turkish law bans proselytizing and a conviction carries a maximum 10-year jail sentence.

A group of Moslem fundamentalists also protested in front of the Turkish film festival April 4, calling the movie offensive to Moslems. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has criticised <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> for including the film and withdrew its own entry from the festival program, Turkish newspapers reported. Religious issues have strained relations between the two nations, and both countries recalled their ambassadors for consultations last week.

<TEXT>
 Two major nursing-home groups filed suit against the government Tuesday to block provisions of a law requiring nursing homes to turn away the mentally ill and mentally retarded. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Car </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homes </ORGANIZATION> for the Aging said the federal government is requiring states to implement the law, which took effect Jan. 1, even though the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> has issued no regulations to guide them. They said the result is that the law will hurt the people it was intended to help by denying them admission to nursing homes even when no alternate care facilities are available. Nursing home applicants and patients who are mentally retarded or mentally ill `` are being held hostage by this legislation and its misguided implementation,'' said <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homes </ORGANIZATION> for the Aging, which represents about 2,500 nursing homes. Though he did not cite specific instances in which mentally ill or mentally retarded patients have been discharged from nursing homes, he said his concern was `` that could happen in the future.'' The suit was filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, naming <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. Department officials had no immediate comment on the lawsuit. Under the law, nursing homes will lose federal Medicaid funds if they accept patients who suffer from mental illness or mental retardation unless they also need nursing home care. Nursing homes get about 44 percent of their revenues from the federal-state Medicaid program. Patients who have lived in a nursing home for fewer than 30 months also must be screened for mental illness and mental retardtion, under the law. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Willging </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents about 9,000 nursing homes, said that without regulations from the <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION>, nursing homes do n't know how to define mental illness. The law exempts Alzheimer's disease, but diagnosis of the condition is difficult and its victims are often classified as mentally ill, he noted. Depending on how mental illness is defined, an estimated 26,000 to 208,000 current residents of the 1.5 million Americans in nursing homes might have to be involuntarily discharged under the law, he said. With few alternate care facilities available in most areas, he said, many of these patients may be left homeless, without even basic levels of care. <PERSON> Willging </PERSON> and <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said the law is well-intentioned in that it seeks to ensure that the mentally ill and mentally retarded get the specialized treatment they need for their conditions. `` But it is equally important to provide some elementary protections,'' <PERSON> Willging </PERSON> said. `` We demand the horse be put before the cart.'' The suit asks the court to put the screening requirements of the law on hold until HHS issues implementing regulations. It also asks the court to prohibit application of the rules to private-pay patients.

To avoid this cost, however, some states have sent these patients to nursing homes, where Medicaid picks up the tab for those who can not pay. More states have special facilities for the mentally retarded because Medicaid helps pay for them, but nursing home care for these patients is often cheaper, he said.

<HEAD>Navy Denies Receiving Cancer Study</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday issued a public denial stating it had never received any medical evidence suggesting sailors who served aboard nuclear missile submarines were more likely to contract cancer. Responding to a report Monday in a trade publication alleging increased risk, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> released a 140-page statistical study performed by the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> that tracked both the in-service and post-service death rates for nuclear submariners. The study, conducted at a cost of $ 600,000, was originally completed in August 1985 and then updated and revised in April 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> insisted there was no reason to challenge the study's conclusion that submariners were not placed at higher risk as a result of their occupation, adding in a statement it would stand by the work of the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> researchers `` The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> has reviewed the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> study, in view of recent news media reports ...,'' the statement said. `` The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> finds that there is no basis in the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> study to conclude there is any health concern related to cancer rates and submarine service on either attack nuclear-powered submarines or ballistic missile nuclear-powered submarines.'' <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and Undersea Technology, a weekly trade publication, reported Monday the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s statistical study contained evidence that sailors who had served aboard nuclear-missile submarines were more likely to develop cancer than their civilian counterparts. The publication said the research reported an `` observed'' rate of cancer cases among former missile submarine personnel of 54, compared to an `` expected'' rate for the general population of 39.4. By contrast, the statistics for sailors who served aboard nuclear-powered attack submarines _ vessels that do not carry nuclear-tipped missiles _ showed the number of cancer deaths precisely matching the expected rate: 22 versus 22.5. The publication also quoted Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON>, an epidemiologist and biostatistician at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, as saying the study utilized procedures that were bound to be biased in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s favor and to underestimate cancer rates. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, in responding Tuesday, said the trade publication had failed to take account of the fact that all such mortality statistics are developed with a range of numbers. While the numbers cited by the publication are correct, as drawn from one table, the observed rate of 54 cancer cases compares to an expected range of `` 26 to 53, based on nationwide averages,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> researchers found that there were 54 actual deaths, one higher than expected. A small increase such as this may be due to normal statistical variation in a group of this size.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> researchers themselves had made the same point in the study, writing: `` It is not proper to interpret this Standard Mortality Ratio as statistical ` proof' that men on -LRB- nuclear missile -RRB- submarines are at elevated risk of cancer ...'' The study distributed on Tuesday was originally requested in 1974 by Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, D-Colo., and her military affairs assistant at the time, Capt <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> submarine skipper who developed cancer. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was treated and survived his cancer, is now an associate director at the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said his interest in pushing the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to conduct the study was spawned by his own experience and the fact that he personally knew 14 former submariners who developed or died from the disease, including four from the same missile boat that he commanded. Phone calls to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday to discuss the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s response were not immediately returned.

<TEXT>
 The Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> will cut the length of military service required for students who have completed higher education courses, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said Tuesday. Under new regulations for conscription, students who graduate this spring will be required to serve only one year in the military instead of 18 months in the army and air force or two years in the navy, the news agency said. The new regulations were expected to begin with the spring intake of conscripts, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announced in March that students could defer military service until after graduation, but it did not specify the length of service that would be required. Previously, all Soviet men between the ages of 18 and 25 were liable for the draft, and there were no exemptions for students. Changes in the conscription system have been under discussion for the past five years, and the program of officer training is also under review, according to the Communist youth newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION>. The new rules apply only to conscripts and not officers or officer candidates, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. About 75 percent of Soviet military personnel are conscripts. Changes in the draft law follow the announcement Dec. 7 by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> that Soviet troop strength would be cut by 500,000 and military spending would be reduced by 14 percent.

<TEXT>
 A coalition of environmental groups on Tuesday sued the state of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and the federal government, alleging they had failed to reduce ozone pollution in the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> area. The lawsuit, filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, seeks to block more than $ 100 million in federal highway and clean-air planning grants until the state takes action to clean the air. `` We believe that <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> has not made a good-faith effort to meet the standards of the Clean Air Act,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Minott </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, one of the plaintiffs. `` If they wo n't do it voluntarily, we'll get a court to force them to do it,'' he said. Ozone pollution forms when fumes from gasoline and other organic chemicals such as cleaning solvents and paint interact with the sun's heat and light. Ozone is the principal component of the brownish smog that covers <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and other urban areas, especially in the summer months. `` 1988 was <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s worst year for ozone pollution since the re-authorization of the Clean Air Act in 1977,'' said <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Balter </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, lead attorney for the council. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blackburn </ORGANIZATION>, said the federal agency had been expecting the suit, but he declined to comment on it until he had read the complaint. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> said the state is trying to launch a far-reaching effort to control ozone pollution with new gasoline volatility regulations. But a state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee, citing costs and possible gas shortages, recommended last week that the new rules not go into effect completely until 1992.

<HEAD>Bush Will Propose Stricter Ethical Standards, Judicial Raises</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> intends to call for more stringent ethical rules on executive branch officials and recommend a 25 percent pay raise for federal judges in a sweeping ethics-in-government program to be unveiled Wednesday, administration officials said Tuesday. But these officials said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has decided for the time being against recommending any hike in the $ 89,500 salary received by members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and will recommend no change in the widely criticized system that permits lawmakers to earn thousands of dollars in speaking fees. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who promised during last year's campaign to crack down on ethical laxness in government, arranged to lay out his recommendations in a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> Editors convention. Among the recommendations is one extending the one-year ban that currently prohibits executive branch employees from lobbying their former office to have it apply to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and to judges, said a source who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In making his proposals, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to accept most of the recommendations made by a special commission he established, and discard some others. The commission that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> set up to recommend changes for an ethics overhaul had called for a ban on honoraria to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for speaking engagements or similar work. Such honoraria provide thousands of dollars in outside income for senators and representatives in a system that critics, including <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ethics panel, contend allows for too much special interest influence on the representatives. But the president decided that the issue of honoraria should be considered in conjunction with the question of a congressional pay raise, separate from the ethics package he was preparing to put forward Wednesday, said the official who spoke anonymously. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal is expected to cover matters such as outside income, conflicts of interest, financial disclosure, enforcement and restrictions on what executive branch employees can do after they leave the government. His announcement follows the March 10 report by his eight-member ethics commission, which detailed 27 recommendations for changes in ethics laws and regulations as they apply to senior officials, judges and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and their staffs. In addition to proposals that require congressional legislation, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will issue an executive order covering executive branch employees, the administration sources said. The order will include provisions to give elevated rank to a designated ethics officer in each department, and will do away with `` compartmentalization'' of the various agencies of the executive branch for purposes of lobbying after working for the government. The current one-year lobbying ban for executive branch workers would remain but would be extended to cover all agencies rather than just the one in which the individual was employed. For instance, a former employee of the vice president's staff would be precluded not only from lobbying that office but also any other executive branch agency, such as the Office of Management and Budget. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform, in its March 10 recommendations, reiterated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign pledge to seek the same ethical standards for the judicial and legislative branches of government that apply to the executive branch. The panel recommended a ban on honoraria for all three branches. White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, without specifically confirming that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had dropped the honoraria provision for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday that the president believes the matter should be discussed in conjunction with congressional pay raises. `` We have always said that honoraria are a part of the pay equation and we do not intend to deal with the congressional pay raise, so it makes sense we would n't deal with the other part of it,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does intend to `` work with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>'' to come up with a pay raise coupled with a resolution on the honoraria question, said an administration source who spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> backed previous pay raise legislation, but <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> itself voted against giving its members a raise earlier this year. `` The subject of honoraria is inherently attached to pay raises. He'd like to work with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> separately on it rather than cramming the honoraria ban down their throat,'' the source said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s executive order also bars senior government officials from serving on the boards of profit-making enterprises, an area that caused complications for his own White House counsel, <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> voluntarily stepped down as chairman of a family-owned communications company after it was revealed that he continued to hold the post in contradiction to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s planned ethics guidelines. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s reported decision on the honoraria question brought immediate criticism from <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON>, president of the organization <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cause </ORGANIZATION>, which backs a congressional pay raise and wants to do away with all honoraria. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal undermines the president's avowed effort to set stricter ethical standards for government. `` It appears he has caved in to pressure by members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who want to keep this corrupt system going. He knows better and it appears the president does n't have the courage of his convictions.''

<HEAD>Cuba Programming Interrupts S. Fla. Prime Time; TV Marti Retaliation?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Viewers watching WCIX-TV were surprised when Cuban television cut in briefly with a preview of `` Endless Love'' starring <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> and a shot of <PERSON> Giron </PERSON>, the site of the Bay of Pigs invasion. And viewers switching past channel 3, a blank, unused channel in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, also got a taste of Cuban government programming. Some think the interference Saturday and Monday was intentional, a warning against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> proceeding with plans for TV <PERSON> Marti </PERSON>, an alternative to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s state-controlled media and the next step after the success of Radio <PERSON> Marti </PERSON>. `` The reason -LRB- Fidel -RRB- <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> may be doing this now is that the legislation to authorize TV <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> is going to be debated on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> this week,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Burris </PERSON>, an aide to Rep. <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Fascell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a key backer of Radio and TV <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> `` Rep. <PERSON> Fascell </PERSON> anticipated this and has already cautioned the administration that they'd better be prepared for this type of action.'' But it may instead have just been a rare combination of technical difficulties and inopportune weather conditions, said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, vice president and manager at CBS-owned WCIX. His station experienced a power outage and briefly was off the air Monday night when the Cuban signal appeared. `` We believe it was a unique combination of circumstance, us going off the air, and of the wether being such that the signal from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> was able to bounce full-strength onto our frequency,'' <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said. Channel 3 carried a variety show and the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government's national news program Saturday <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pino </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Cuban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interests </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Section </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, would not confirm or deny the jamming was a warning from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. Cuban <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials have suggested that if TV <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> goes into operation, their government might retaliate by beaming TV programs to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, even if the signal interfered with American stations. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration began considering TV <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> after seeing the success of <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION>, which broadcasts news, editorials and entertainment to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> under the auspices of the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. Both are named after <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> independence hero <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Marti </PERSON>. The TV Marti section of the annual House authorization bill is based on a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version passed last year that provided $ 7.5 million for starting costs and a study to determine whether TV <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> is viable. The study, released in January, endorsed TV <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> but cautioned that <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s ability to retaliate be weighed closely before proceeding.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Nassau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has begun random drug testing in certain narcotics squads, making it one of the first departments in the nation to test officers for drug use. Officers who fail the test will be fired, and officers who refuse to take it also may be dismissed. The program was announced to the 200 officers in the drug-fighting squads this week and is effective immediately. The policy follows a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision which last month upheld the right of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to randomly test employees who work on drug interdiction even without reasonable suspicion an officer has used drugs. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>, attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benevolent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, said the union has not decided whether to challenge Nassau's new policy. The program is designed to make the public and officers confident of an officer's integrity, Commissioner <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rozzi </PERSON> said. He noted that the officers assigned to the drug units, including undercover agents and police lab workers, have ready access to drugs. `` Almost all of our officers are above reproach _ the finest in the country,'' said <PERSON> Rozzi </PERSON>, whose department on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> numbers 3,200. `` We want to be able to weed out the one or two who are not.'' For 15 years, the <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> department has drug-screened applicants, officers during their first year of probation, and those under suspicion of drug use. Since 1983, nine officers and two civilian employees have been fired for illegal drug use. Six of the officers were charged with crimes. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, random testing for drugs was started last October among the approximately 1,000 officers assigned to the <ORGANIZATION> Organized </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, are awaiting court rulings on drug detection programs being fought by their police unions. In 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> implemented a random mandatory testing program for all its members. The program was suspended after eight months when the state attorney general advised that it may be an unconstitutional invasion of privacy. <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> officers asked that an annual mandatory drug screening exam be written into their contracts.

<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> lawmakers have ratified a bill requiring background checks and a seven-day waiting period for buyers of military-style semiautomatic assault weapons. The bill, prompted by January's schoolyard shooting in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and by an upswing in street violence involving semiautomatic weapons, was approved late Monday in the closing hours of the 1989 General Assembly session. The measure still must be signed by Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON>, whose support is expected. Under the legislation, state police would check the background of a prospective gun buyer before a sale could be completed. The sale would be canceled if police found evidence that the applicant was a drug addict, alcoholic, convicted felon or was mentally deranged. Purchases of 24 specific gun models are affected, and those who violate the law would be subject to prison terms of up to three years and maximum fines of $ 10,000. Earlier in the 90-day session, some legislators proposed banning the sale of semiautomatics altogether, but later modified the measure in the face of overwhelming resistance. In 1988, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> passed a bill eliminating cheap handguns known as Saturday Night Specials. The measure established a nine-member board to decide which guns may be manufactured and sold in the state. Gun control opponents spent $ 6 million in a losing effort to defeat that bill. Continued pressure from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has kept lawmakers leery of further weapons legislation. However, lawmakers around the nation have felt pressure to control the spread of semiautomatic weapons, particularly after January's schoolyard tragedy in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, where a gunman killed five children and wounded 30 other people in a rapid burst of gunfire from an AK-47.

 About 200 prison inmates took eight guards hostage Tuesday but released them at the end of the day and returned quietly to their cells, authorities said.

 A barge carrying a nuclear reactor vessel resumed its trip up the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> on Tuesday after a fire aborad the tugboat pulling it caused a seven-hour delay.

The two men sought asylum, citing death threats following a military court decision last week to free 19 police and soldiers involved in the killing of 14 other Venezuelan fishermen on Oct. 29. The Rev. <PERSON> Oswaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Santana </PERSON> told reporters that <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wolmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinilla </PERSON> went to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> diplomatic mission late Monday, and were moved to a Roman Catholic church in the eastern slums of <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, where they will receive `` unconditional protection.'' <PERSON> Santana </PERSON>, the church's human rights vicar, said they are depending on the sanctity of the church to keep the men safe. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pinilla </PERSON> said they survived the October shooting by jumping in a river and swimming to safety. They later sought asylum in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, while a lower military court ruled them guilty of `` military rebellion.'' In January, the military court declared <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pinilla </PERSON> innocent and ordered the arrest of the 19. This followed a congressional investigation that declared the 14 dead men were murdered and the military brigade had tried to cover up their actions by accusing the fishermen of being Colombian guerrillas. The highest rung of the military justice system last week declared the lower military court had lacked authority, and freed the 19 lawmen on a legal technicality. A socialist congressman who supported the survivors, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON>, called the decision a `` legal prison break.'' Since the men were freed, <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON> said he, <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pinilla </PERSON>, have got numerous anonymous telephone calls threatening their lives. Local reporters following the case also reported receiving death threats. `` This situation is extremely grave, not only for the lives of the two men, but also for the correct administration of justice,'' Rev. <PERSON> Santana </PERSON> told reporters. The Oct. 29 slayings had prompted four days of student riots in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> and elsewhere in which news reports said at least one person was killed and at least 57 were wounded. Church groups and human rights organizations worldwide sent letters of protest to the government. Also Tuesday, the Venezuelan Episcopal Conference of `` grave dangers'' facing democracy. They said Venezuelans have lost faith in the administration of justice and their political leadership. In a document, the bishops called on corrupt Venezuelan politicians and businessmen to return billions of dollars illegally siphoned from the country in the last 10 years. In February, government-imposed price increases prompted riots that left at least 270 dead by official count. Unofficial sources say that death toll was as high as 2,000.

 Police arrested hundreds of people and were seizing tens of thousands of hunting rifles from Soviet Georgians in an attempt to calm the republic, which on Tuesday mourned 19 people killed in a pro-independence rally. Tanks, armored personnel carriers and soldiers patrolled the streets of the southern republic's capital, <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, to enforce a ban on public gatherings and an 11 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, apparently signaling a tough <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> response to any more outbursts of nationalist feeling, expressed his resolve to oppose `` extremism, anti-Soviet displays and the destructive actions of adventurist elements.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s comments at a meeting with <PERSON> Hans-Jochen </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, the head of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, were carried by the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he considered it a `` sacred'' principle that Georgians and others should have the right to express their opinions freely, but said the law set limits on their actions, <ORGANIZATION> Hans-Vogel </ORGANIZATION> reported after the meeting. `` The question of state power is nothing to be trifled with or taken lightly,'' <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as saying. Reports indicated a general strike that began Friday to back demands for <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s secession was easing. Some buses and trolleys resumed routes Tuesday, and police who accompanied the vehicles on their rounds were beaten, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. It said many schools also remained closed by boycotts. Tuesday was declared a day of mourning to mark what the <ORGANIZATION> Georgian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, <PERSON> Djhumber </PERSON> <PERSON> Patiashvili </PERSON>, called `` a common grief'' _ the deaths of civilians killed in a clash Sunday with soldiers and police at the pro-independence demonstration. Cars and trolleys were adorned with black flags and people wore black clothes and ribbons, said <PERSON> Nana </PERSON> <PERSON> Natadze </PERSON>, wife of a Georgian nationalist activist. `` Everything is black,'' she said in a telephone interview from the city of 1.2 million people, 900 miles south of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` Everyone's suffering.'' Georgian radio and TV canceled regular programs to play dirges and report news, said <PERSON> Nanuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogua </PERSON>, another <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> resident whose daughter, <PERSON> Irina </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarishvili </PERSON>, was among a half-dozen <LOCATION> Georgian </LOCATION> activists arrested over the weekend. All entertainment activities were called off, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. About 200 people were arrested for violating the curfew, and police were confiscating 66,000 registered hunting rifles from the public temporarily, <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday, without giving a reason. The government daily <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said 464 people were arrested for curfew violations. Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazarishvili </PERSON>, an anesthesiologist at the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, said a 32-year-old man died Tuesday morning of injuries suffered in Sunday's clash. He said that brought the death toll from the confrontation to at least 19, although he said he heard unconfirmed reports of as many as 50 deaths. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said at a news briefing Tuesday his latest information put the death toll at 18, and 120 civilians and 75 police and soldiers injured. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said more than 200 were hurt. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said one woman died of `` traumatic shock'' and 12 people were crushed to death. He said the causes of the other deaths were undetermined. In a report on the TV news program Vremya, <PERSON> Patiashvili </PERSON> said no one expected fatalities when troops armed with clubs and shields were ordered to clear demonstrators from <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>'s main street. `` After the troops started to act, they -LRB- the demonstrators -RRB- did n't retreat. And then the unpredictable happened,'' he said. `` The troops did n't back off, and unfortunately, innocent people who were not active participants in the demonstration died.'' `` Unfortunately,'' he added, `` the leaders immediately fled, and not one of them was scratched.'' `` It happened, and we share a common grief,'' the <LOCATION> Georgian </LOCATION> party leader said. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said all factories were working but some not at full capacity because `` some women decided to stay home with their children.'' Public transport, he said, was operating at `` almost normal levels.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, an ethnic Georgian, was sent to his home republic to help quell the unrest. The foreign minister met with a crowd on a street and had a `` heated but at the same time substantive dialogue,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said without elaborating. While serving as Georgian party chief from 1972-1985, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> called for tolerance between Georgians and ethnic Abkhazians, a minority living in the western part of the republic. In 1978, he supported nationalists on a law making Georgian the republic's official language. Demontrations in the southern province, where former Soviet leader <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> was born, began April 4. Protesters had attacked calls from some Abkhazians to break away from the republic because of alleged discrimination by Georgians. Others demanded that <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> secede from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> because of alleged interference by the central government in their political, economic and cultural affairs.

<TEXT>
 Nearly 25,000 children in military families nationwide are on waiting lists for child care despite <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> efforts to expand its child care program, according to a study released Tuesday. The survey, conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, found that military child care facilities are providing day care for about 62,000 children, an 82 percent increase over the end of the 1984 fiscal year. Two types of care are available to families living on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> bases _ child development centers, provided in government-built and subsidized facilities by trained care givers; and family day care homes, usually provided in government housing by non-military spouses. The survey of 200 military installations in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> found that child development centers have the capacity to care for more than 38,500 children, while 4,557 day care homes can care for as many as 23,417 children. Eighty percent of the remaining 24,729 children, who are on waiting lists, need full-day care. The survey, by the congressional watchdog agency, had no information on nationwide spending for military child care. Worldwide, however, operating costs for child care centers totaled $ 101.6 million in fiscal 1985, including $ 31.4 million in federally appropriated funds, the report said. By fiscal 1987, federal spending had increased 39 percent, to $ 43.6 million out of a total cost of $ 134.3 million, the survey said. If the program is to continue to grow, many child care centers need to be renovated or built, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. Military parents' child care needs are complicated by the fact that they often work unusual hours, ca n't rely on extended family for help and, because of frequent moves, do n't have the support of an established neighborhood, according to the report.

 The conviction of four Puerto Rican nationalists in the $ 7.1 million Wells Fargo robbery could revitalize the independence movement in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, a professor who has written a book about the case said Tuesday. `` It's going to provide a tremendous stimulous,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, a sociology professor at <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Five defendants were accused of being members of <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macheteros </ORGANIZATION>, a militant group seeking Puerto Rican independence. The group has been linked to terrorist attacks on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military installations on the <LOCATION> Carribean </LOCATION> island. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, who wrote `` <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Macheteros </LOCATION>'' about the case, compared their cases to that of Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, on trial in the Iran-Contra case. `` <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> was clearly engaged in revolutionary activity, clearly used violence and allegedly used illegal means. But a large number of Americans perceive him to be a hero, a patriot and are willing to look the other way. It's the same thing for the Macheteros in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` A portion of the population regards them as patriots and regard this a terribly unjust thing.'' <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, 39; <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON> <PERSON> Negron </PERSON>, 45; <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> <PERSON> Talavera </PERSON>, 32; and <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Maldonado </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, 53, were convicted Monday at <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, ending a trial that began Oct. 11, 1988. <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON> was found guilty on robbery, conspiracy and transportation of stolen money charges, but innocent on four weapons-related charges. He's being held without bond and faces up to 165 years in prison. <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON>'s bond was revoked and he faces up to 15 years in prison, while the others face up to five years behind bars. No sentencing date was set. A fifth defendant, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayes </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON>, 29, an anthropology student, was the only defendant found innocent. He had faced a conspiracy charge stemming from the Sept. 12, 1983, heist of about 900 pounds in cash from the <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> depot in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> said the defendants should have been tried in a different location by an Hispanic jury. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Twardy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> did n't immediately return telephone calls to his office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The military, criticized for killing two reporters last month, said Tuesday it will not fire on journalists' vehicles even if they ignore or inadvertently run a roadblock. Two reporters were killed and another seriously wounded in March by soldiers manning roadblocks. The incidents are being investigated, but the armed forces have acknowledged that in at least one of the cases the soldier fired without provocation. In another development, President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> returned to his duties at the Presidential Palace after five days of convalescence from side effects of cancer treatment. A document containing instructions on military relations with the press was signed Tuesday by Defense Minister Gen. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Vides </PERSON> <PERSON> Casanova </PERSON>. It says that if a news vehicle passes through a roadblock, soldiers manning the position `` will limit themselves to taking down the license plate number, to be reported to the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, which will take appropriate action. Under no circumstances will the vehicles or their occupants be fired upon.'' Security force roadblocks are common in zones where fighting is heaviest in this Central American country, ravaged by nine years of civil war between leftist guerrillas and the U.S.-backed government. News vehicles are identified by the local convention of affixing, with tape, the large letters `` TV'' on the windshield, sides, roof and back. They also fly small white flags out windows or from antennae. The document, to be distributed in the form of an order to military units nationwide, also prohibits the arrest of accredited journalists discovered in battle zones without a safe-conduct document from the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>. Such passes are required for access to regions of frequent fighting. Journalists who have entered such areas without the pass have been arrested. The new regulation authorizes local commanders only to take down the violator's name and affiliation, for relay to the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, which would administer any sanction. The new document also prohibits confiscation of equipment, film or written material under any circumstances. Military authorities in the past have temporarily impounded or confiscated such material, prompting protests from the local correspondents' association `` We feel it is our obligation to establish regulations that, in addition to improving our relationship with the media, allow both of us to carry out our missions in the best possible manner,'' said the document. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s secretary <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Vallejos </PERSON> said the president met with several ministers and other officials when he resumed his duties. In a telephone interview, she described his mood as `` animated.'' Duate, a 63-year-old Christian Democrat, is dying of liver cancer. Chemotherapy intended to slow the advance of the disease provoked severe nausea and vomiting last week. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> became dehydrated and was confined to bed for intravenous feeding. He temporarily delegated the presidency to Vice President <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> <PERSON> Claramount </PERSON>. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s five-year term ends June 1, when he is to hand power over to President-elect <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> of the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> was elected March 19.

 The mother and sisters of Irish hostage <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> appealed for his release Tuesday on the third anniversary of his abduction in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>, 38, an English-language teacher at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION>, was kidnapped April 11, 1986. No group has claimed responsibility for his abduction. `` We, the family of <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> who is today held hostage for three years, want to appeal to those who are holding him for some news about his well-being,'' <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>'s family said in a statement. An Arabic-language translation of the statement was published by the independent daily An-Nahar and leftist As-Safir. `` We again appeal to those holding our dear son and brother <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> to release him and let him go in peace,'' the statement said. It was signed by <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>'s mother, identified only Mrs. <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>, and his sisters <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilham </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> said Tuesday that <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> came within 10 minutes of being released in January before something mysteriously went wrong. `` Our hopes were highest in January and we now know that <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> was 10 minutes away from being released,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> said in a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> radio interview. `` He was clean shaven.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Soldiers whose revolt was crushed by loyal troops over the weekend have begun returning to duty after Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>'s military government promised not to punish them. Radio Soleil, the Roman Catholic church radio station, said more than 230 of the <ORGANIZATION> Dessalines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barracks </ORGANIZATION>' 750 soldiers had reported to army headquarters by Tuesday morning. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> <PERSON> Elie </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> said Monday no rebels were being held prisoner. The government has said they will be treated `` with dignity'' and no reprisals will be taken. Two gunmen identified as Dessalines deserters hijacked a twin-engine airplane Monday that was carrying missionaries based in <LOCATION> Redlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, from <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The hijackers diverted the plane to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and surrendered. The seven other passsengers and the pilot were not harmed. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>'s 1,100-man Presidential Guard based at the National Palace stormed the adjoining <LOCATION> Dessalines </LOCATION> barracks Saturday to put down a rebellion among soldiers demanding that the general give up the presidency. Fighting began Friday night and lasted 20 hours. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> told reporters Monday most of the cartridges used initially were blanks, in order to reduce casualties. He said the Saturday assault with live ammunition occurred after mortar shells from the <ORGANIZATION> Dessalines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barracks </ORGANIZATION> landed near the palace, killing three soldiers. Five soldiers were killed in the two days of fighting, and a sixth died Sunday while trying to recover an unexploded grenade, <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> said. He also reported one civilian killed and 43 soldiers and 32 civilians wounded. It remained unclear whether <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> would disband the <PERSON> Dessalines </PERSON>, widely regarded as the most repressive unit in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s 7,000-man army. Col. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Francois </PERSON>, its former commander, was said to have been given temporary asylum in the <ORGANIZATION> Vatica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. The government has identified <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> as one of four leaders of a coup attempt April 2. Negotiations continued between the government and the 414-member <ORGANIZATION> Leopards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battalion </ORGANIZATION>, the other unit that rebelled last week. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Himmler </PERSON> <PERSON> Rebu </PERSON>, the commander, was deported after being named as a conspirator in the coup attempt. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> said 12 Leopards had not returned to their base, but the battalion had accepted government authority. `` Everything is on the way to the re-establishment of order,'' Adjutant Gen. <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean-Pierre </PERSON> said Tuesday.

 <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> defended his efforts for the Nicaraguan Contras Tuesday, testifying at his trial that he knew a pivotal letter his boss sent <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the subject was false but regarded it as a `` political problem,'' not a fraud. `` Did any moral bells go off in your head?'' asked prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>. `` It would n't be proper to describe it as a moral bell,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> said, and then he turned his focus to the cut-off of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Contra aid that led to his secret efforts. `` I thought it was extraordinarily immoral to have put a force in the field, to have fed it, armed it, equipped it and then leave it in the lurch,'' said <PERSON> North </PERSON>. `` It was heinous. I happened to be right smack dab in the middle of it.'' All through his fourth day as a witness at his Iran-Contra trial, <PERSON> North </PERSON> defended his honor as well as his efforts on behalf of the Nicaraguan rebels, meeting a fusillade of suggestions from <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> that he violated the code he was taught at the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> accused North of telling `` a flat-out, 100 percent, old-fashioned, All-American lie'' when he was instrumental in getting President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to send thank-you notes to a fund-raiser and a major donor to the Contras. <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> read from a document which quoted North as giving an assurance the two were `` not involved in raising private funds for the Contras.'' Other questioning concerned a letter sent by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> Adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> on Sept. 5, 1985, to Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., then the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> That letter, denying news accounts that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff was soliciting donations and offering tactical advice to the Contras, is at the heart of several charges concerning lying to or obstructing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` I recognized it to be false because I had gone to some lengths since 1984 to get his -LRB- <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>'s -RRB- approval for and keep him apprised of what I was doing,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> said of the letter. `` It denied the things he sent me off to do.'' Did n't he see the letter as a fraud on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>? the prosecutor asked. `` To me a fraud means to break the law. I did not recognize it as breaking the law. I recognized it more as an increasing political problem,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> replied. But, he said, `` I'm not proud of this ... I did n't think it was unlawful, but I did n't think it was right.'' He said he had urged <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> to assert executive privilege and refuse to reply to <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> and, failing in that argument, attached `` talking points'' to <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>'s draft to discuss before the letter went out. Asked why his insistence on executive privilege did not show up in attached notes, <PERSON> North </PERSON> said by that point he felt he had lost the argument. `` What is not in the notes is anything about fund-raising,'' said <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>. `` Surely, he and the president had done it,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> said. `` He -LRB- McFarlane -RRB- had authorized me to go to the Taiwanese; I had arranged for the <LOCATION> Peoples </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to get missiles; he knew I had arranged air drops of weapons and intelligence and recoilless rifles -LRB- to the Contras. -RRB- He knew all of these things, none of which was in those letters.'' `` I believe <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>'s letter was false to the point of being deceptive,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> asked <PERSON> North </PERSON> about a recommendation, approved and forwarded by <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sign thank-you notes to fund-raiser <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> and to <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Newington </PERSON> who had contributed $ 250,000. A document introduced by <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel Fred Fielding approved the recommendation on grounds that <PERSON> North </PERSON> had said neither had been involved in fund-raising. <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> characterized that assertion as `` a flat-out, 100 percent, old-fashioned, All-American lie.'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> said he barely knew Fielding. `` At the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Naval Academy you would have been kicked out for this?'' <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> asked at one point in connection with <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s role in drafting the McFarlane letter to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` In the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Naval Academy nobody taught me to run a covert operation,'' North retorted. Nor about `` political warfare going on in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1983-1986.'' On another matter, <PERSON> North </PERSON> denied he tried to help his associate, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, make a half million dollars by renting a ship to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, which turned out not to be interested in the offer. During a 1984-1986 congressional ban on military aid to the rebels, <PERSON> North </PERSON> had enlisted <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> to run arms to the Contras, an operation which the government alleges turned millions of dollars in profits for <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> major general. <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> has been trying to draw a connection between <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s profits and favors done for North For example, one charge against <PERSON> North </PERSON> is that he illegally accepted a $ 13,800 home security system paid for by <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>. `` At the Naval Academy you were taught falsehood included deception?'' asked <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> of the witness, a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel until he resigned in the wake of the Iran-Contra affair. `` You were also trained to obey all lawful orders,?'' asked <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>, underlining the word lawful on a large pad on an easel facing the jury. `` Did you take courses in that and learn what was meant by lawful and unlawful ... you were trained and taught that it was a crime when in World War II at the end of the war German officers came and said they were ordered to do it?'' Said North: `` I do n't believe I have ever received an unlawful order.''

<HEAD>New Fusion Experiments Still Leave Many Questions On Process</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Despite two tests that seem to confirm part of a <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> cold nuclear fusion experiment, experts said Tuesday that more questions need to be answered before most scientists accept there has been a breakthrough. `` We're all mystified by this and watching it,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Meade </PERSON>, head of fusion reaction research at <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION> niversity. `` It's the scientific way to be skeptical. That process is still going on.'' <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> and others said the experiments announced Monday at <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M and <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> did shed some light on what <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> officials claim is a demonstration of fusion at room temperature. But most experts remain unconvinced that fusion has actually taken place and some suggest the phenomenon may be something new to science. `` They -LRB- <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> researchers -RRB- have taken the position that it was a fusion reaction,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Soures </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION> fusion scientist. `` But that has yet to proven.'' `` I think this whole thing may go down as one of the most bizarre episodes in 20th century science,'' he added. In an announcement two weeks ago, <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southhampton </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> said they had achieved fusion using ordinary laboratory equipment at room temperature. Their experiment used a rod of palladium and a coil of platinum immersed in a beaker of deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen commonly found in seawater. <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> said that when electrical power was applied to the coil for about 100 hours, it forced deuterium atoms into the palladium until they finally fused, producing energy in the form of heat. <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> claimed the device made four watts of energy for every watt of energy used. Fusion has been the goal of thousands of scientists around the world for more than a quarter century. It is the energy secret of the stars, the sun, and the reaction that gives the boom to the hydrogen bomb. If the reaction could be controlled, scientists believe it could be the ultimate energy source, giving virtually limitless electrical power using a cheap fuel extracted from sea water and producing only modest amounts of radiation hazard. In fusion, hydrogen atoms are forced together. As they fuse, they give off energy, neutrons and helium-3, a stable chemical. Fusion is the opposite of fission, the nuclear reaction that splits the atomic nucleus. Fission is the force that powers atomic power plants and nuclear bombs. At <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M, scientists said Monday an apparatus similar to the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> experiment did produce some excess energy, but the reaction was so small that their equipment was not sensitive enough to detect the flow of neutrons, a characteristic of fusion. A & amp; M's <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said his group could have come from some `` unusual chemical process'' and not from nuclear fusion. This possibility, he said, is being investigated. A similar experiment at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> did produce neutrons, causing researcher <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Livesay </PERSON> to announce, `` There's no question it's fusion. I still do n't believe it, even though I see it.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> experiment began producing neutron particles and probes measured a flow of about 560 neutrons an hour above the background radiation. However, <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahaffey </PERSON> said the team did not confirm that the experiment produced more energy than it used. <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> said fusion can not be confirmed until more laboratories have conducted the experiment and made precise measurements of both the heat production and the flow of neutrons. He said the rise in neutrons and in heat should `` track'' each other, that is, show by measurement to be directly related. `` It is not enough to just see some heat there and the hint of a few neutrons,'' said <PERSON> Meade </PERSON>. `` We need to be able to relate this energy to some process that would produce it.'' He said the amount of energy reported in the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> experiment would develop trillions of neutrons a second, and if the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> experiments matched the energy output, they, too, would have high neutron flow. `` They are missing billions of neutrons per second,'' said <PERSON> Meade </PERSON>. `` They hypothize that is may a different type of nuclear reaction than we have known. Physics experts around the world are trying to come up with some nuclear reaction that we have n't seen before. It possible, but not very probable.'' Both <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> and <PERSON> Soures </PERSON> said the energy surge seen in the experiment may be created by a `` battery effect.'' `` It takes weeks for the energy output to get up to the reported levels,'' said <PERSON> Soures </PERSON>. `` This suggests that it's operating more like a battery than fusion.'' He said the device could be storing the electrical energy put into the experiment and then discharging the power as heat when it becomes satuated. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON> of the Department of Energy laboratory in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, said that a good explanation of the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> experiment will not be developed until more experiments are conducted and the fundamental process is finally understood. `` Sometimes, these things could drag on for months before they are resolved,'' he said. `` But right now, I do n't think it is a breakthrough that will be useful.''

 Drug czar <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON>, believed to be the biggest cocaine dealer in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, was charged Tuesday with possession, trafficking and transportation of illegal drugs. `` I do n't know why they connect me with the cocaine business,'' he said in the 10th District Court after the charges were read. `` I have never had that type of dealings.'' The court is located inside the Southern Prison on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON> stood behind bars during the proceeding. He was asked if he used drugs and he replied, `` Yes, sporadically, but I'm not an addict.'' <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON> was moved under heavy guard before dawn from the Attorney General's office where he had been held since his arrest Saturday in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION>. Nine others arrested in the investigation, including several of <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON>'s aides and the chief federal anti-drug official and five other ranking police officers in <LOCATION> Sinaloa </LOCATION> state, were jailed in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s Northern Prison. Authorities on Monday seized some of <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON>'s assets, including a hotel, pharmacy, real-estate company, bank accounts and other properties. No value was placed on the assets, but his net worth is estimated to exceed $ 500 million. He was asked in court how much he earned. He said he could not say. Judge <PERSON> Amado </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvardo </PERSON> said the charges against <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON> carry a sentence of seven to 15 years. The judge has three days to decide whether to issue an indictment and then a year to review the evidence and present the verdict. Attorney General <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> on Monday called <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON> `` the No. 1 drug trafficker in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.'' In the northwestern state of <LOCATION> Sinaloa </LOCATION>, judicial police patrolled the residential zones in <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON>'s hometown of <LOCATION> Culiacan </LOCATION>, especially the districts where he owned property. <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON>, 43, was taken to the 10th District Court on the basis of a warrant the court issued for him in 1986 after the arrest of <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Devere </PERSON> <PERSON> Becerra </PERSON>. Parts of the 500-page court document read to <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON> were based on testimony by <PERSON> Devere </PERSON> <PERSON> Becerra </PERSON>, who allegedly was <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON>'s partner for a year or two beginning in 1983. <PERSON> Devere </PERSON> <PERSON> Becerra </PERSON> also has been linked to other drug traffickers, including <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>, who was arrested in the 1985 slaying of American <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>. <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> was sentenced in September 1988 to 34 years in prison after being convicted on drug-related charges. He has not been tried in the abduction, torture and killing of <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>. That case is in a court in the western city of <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION>. During Tuesday's hearing, <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON> denied knowing <PERSON> Devere </PERSON> <PERSON> Becerra </PERSON> or at least four other reputed narcotics kingpins. He was not asked about <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> said Monday his office had no evidence linking <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON> directly to the killing of <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>, but he said he was the `` intellectual author'' of the organization that murdered the agent. <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON> was asked by the court what he did between March and December of 1984 _ the period covered by <PERSON> Devere </PERSON> <PERSON> Becerra </PERSON>'s depositions He said, `` During this period I was only dedicated to my hotel business, and a concession for sales of building, along with various businesses in which I'm up to date on tax payments.'' He gave his profession as a businessman, said he was married and had four children and had attended junior high school. He also said he was a native of <LOCATION> Culiacan </LOCATION> and lived in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON> denied testimony in the court record that he used several airplanes, including his own $ 1.5 million Aerocommander, to transport drugs from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to various parts of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and sometimes across the border to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The government's <ORGANIZATION> Export-Import </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which has been borrowing money at more than 9 per cent interest, announced Tuesday it is making a $ 17 million loan to the firm of <PERSON> Babcock </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> at 6.5 percent. Most loans by the bank go to other countries to encourage them to buy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods, but the bank also is authorized to lend to American companies to help them compete for business at home against subsidized loans from other governments. <PERSON> Babcock </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> will use the money to install a heat recovery boiler at a <ORGANIZATION> Gaylord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Container </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> paper mill at <LOCATION> Bogalusa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. The loan is for eight years, with repayment beginning in July 1990. The loan was announced after the government determined that the Brazilian government had offered a 6.5 percent `` noncompetitive'' loan to <LOCATION> Gotaverken </LOCATION>, a joint venture of Brazilian and Swedish companies. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank matched the offer. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Frey </PERSON>, public information officer at the bank, said, `` <PERSON> Babcock </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> employees will build the equipment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. We're supporting American jobs and not Brazilian jobs.'' A noncompetitive loan by an official agency needs a subsidy from taxpayers to make up the difference between the higher interest rate that the government has to pay for the money it borrows and the lower-cost financing it offers to the private company. Last time the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank itself borrowed money it had to pay 9.34 percent.

<TEXT>
 A nurse's aide who reported a suspicious death at a hospital last year was questioned Tuesday by police investigating four other nurse's aides who confessed to what they described as 49 `` mercy killings.'' All the patients at <LOCATION> Lainz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> were elderly _ 75 years or older _ and were killed over the past six years with overdoses of medicine or by water forced into their lungs. Police said they doubted the claim of mercy killing because of the methods used. One investigator said the nurse's aides also admitted to killing patients they considered a nuisance. After a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, Chancellor <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> spoke of the case as `` the most brutal and gruesome crime in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s history.'' The killings prompted <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Zilk </PERSON> to evoke <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> medical experiments at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> and other death camps. `` The death angels of Lainz remind me of the death angels of <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Zilk </PERSON> said during a televised debate late Monday. Nurse's aides <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON>, 25; <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Leidolf </PERSON>, 27; <PERSON> Waltraud </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, 30, and <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON>, 50, are in custody, but no charges have been filed. Three were arrested Friday and one Sunday. Police said Ms. <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> admitted killing 39 patients, 22 of them by forcing water into their lungs, and Ms. <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> to killing five patients, one with water. A fifth nurse's aide, Chilean-born <PERSON> Dorah </PERSON> <PERSON> Eugenie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrada-Avendano </PERSON>, was on vacation when a warrant for her arrest was issued, and she went to police Tuesday for questioning. Authorities said they doubted she was involved and speculated the other four implicated her because she reported her suspicions last year. The first deaths in the ward _ which has come to be known as `` The Death Pavilion'' _ occurred in 1983, but most were committed in the last two years, police said. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelbacher </PERSON>, a senior police investigator, said Tuesday that questioning of nursing personnel substantiated the assumption of `` knowledge and suspicion'' about the crimes committed at the hospital's <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. He said police got the impression staff members did not take rumors about the deaths seriously. <PERSON> Edelbacher </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the total of patients killed will probably rise above 49 with further investigation. As aides, the women were supposed to wash and feed patients, but not to give injections, according to hospital officials. Austrian radio said Ms. <PERSON> Ferrada-Avendano </PERSON> told police she knew of one murder and told a doctor about it. But <PERSON> Edelbacher </PERSON> said she knew of killings at the hospital two or three years before she first mentioned her suspicion last year. He said that as a single woman coming from abroad and having to look after a son, she was under constraint that made it hard for her to approach authorities. Police Chief <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Boegl </PERSON> has said the overdoses administered were insulin or tranquilizers. Police sources said aides plugged the noses of at least 23 victims and pumped water into their lungs. Investigators said each nurse knew the others were killing patients, and in some cases two nurses would act together. An unidentified man, confirming a newspaper interview, told Austrian TV he saw <PERSON> Waltraud </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> administer sleeping medication to a 86-year-old male patient who died hours later. The man refused to face the camera or give his name. <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Pesendorfer </PERSON>, who heads the department where the murders occurred, said he and his doctors could not have known about the mass slayings because the crimes were committed in a secret and sophisticated way. <PERSON> Edelbacher </PERSON> said police met `` a wall of silence'' when they tried to get the name of the doctor said to have been told about suspicious events in the ward. <PERSON> Zilk </PERSON> read a police statement that said the doctor, when finally identified, refused to name his informant. The mayor appointed a commission to consider possible negligence at the hospital, <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>'s fourth largest.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, the flamboyant singer and film actress, was freed from jail Tuesday after a court granted her bail on a charge of possessing cocaine. Magistrate <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence-Beswick </PERSON> freed the Jamaica-born Ms. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> on $ 2,700 bail on condition she returns for trial June 6. Ms. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 36, who became a movie star in the <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> film `` A View to a Kill,'' sat on a prisoner's bench, occasionally conferring with her lawyer. She was not asked to enter a plea. Her lawyer, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Tavares-Finson </PERSON>, told the court the entertainer is not a drug user, and is involved in the campaign against drug abuse. Spectators packed the small courtroom. A crowd of about 200 gathered outside the courthouse, and some shouted support as she left. Ms. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> had been held in a police station cell since Saturday, when police charge they found 0.006 ounces of cocaine wrapped in two $ 2 Jamaican bills in her purse. If convicted, she probably will be fined rather than jailed because of the small quantity of the narcotic involved, court observers said. At Tuesday's hearing, Clerk of Court <PERSON> Alicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> opposed bail, saying the actress would not be inclined to return for trial because of her business obligations. But <PERSON> Tavares-Finson </PERSON> said it was because of recording and advertising contracts that Ms. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> wants to stand trial so she can be cleared of the charge. Ms. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> was arrested after police raided the Music Mountain Recording Studio in the <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Stony </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, which also doubles as the home of her husband, record producer <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>. According to the prosecution, the entertainer was in a bedroom when police approached. Police searched her handbag and allegedly found a small quantity of cocaine wrapped in a $ 2 bill. At the <LOCATION> Stony </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> police station later, police searched her bag again and found more cocaine wrapped in another $ 2 bill, the prosecution alleged. Ms. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who has been called the `` high priestess of androgyny,'' is known for her crewcut and bizarre stage acts. She grew up in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and studied acting before becoming a model in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. She appeared on the covers of <LOCATION> Vogue </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Elle </PERSON> magazines. She now lives in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. As a singer, Ms. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> capitalized on the disco boom. Her most recent album, `` No Compromise,'' produced by <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, is scheduled to come out in June.

<TEXT>
 Bishop <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeler </PERSON> was named Tuesday as the 14th archbishop of the nation's oldeset archdiocese. `` I am honored and deeply grateful to our Holy Father for this assignment,'' <PERSON> Keeler </PERSON>, 58, said at a news conference. `` I pledge to Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> my loyalty, and I know that I have his support.'' He will be installed May 23, succeeding Archbishop <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Borders </PERSON>, 75, who retired. Borders will continue to serve as administrative leader of the archdiocese until <PERSON> Keeler </PERSON>'s installation <PERSON> Keeler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said he was both bewildered and humbled. `` Bewildered because of my human limitations and also because it meant leaving the Diocese of <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, where I have been as a priest and bishop for so many years,'' he said. `` Humbled because of the new and heavier responsiblities and because of a long line of great archbishops here,'' <PERSON> Keeler </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Keeler </PERSON> is considered a conservative. He has taken stances against cohabitation, premarital sex, abortion and capital punishment. Borders had a reputation as a liberal, supporting an increased role for women and the laity in the church and opposing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the government in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. In taking over the oldest archdiocese in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which observes its bicentennial this fall, <PERSON> Keeler </PERSON> will confront such challenges as the alarming decrease in the number of Catholic priests and nuns. Following church tradition, Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> chose the new archbishop after a secretive selection process in which the pontiff considered the recommendations of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bishops, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials.

 Princess <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> had a brief reunion Tuesday with her husband of 15 years while a royal aide the tabloids say is `` besotted'' with her remained on duty behind the walls of Windsor Castle. All three kept silent on the questions that grip <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s mass-circulation newspapers: Is the marriage of the queen's only daughter in trouble, and is <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON>, the royal aide who wrote four letters to her, the other man in her life Buckingham Palace refused to comment on reports that <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON>, a handsome 34-year-old bachelor who is a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> commander, had offered his resignation to Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. It said only that the theft of the four letters delivered to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s largest-circulation tabloid, was under investigation by <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard. In a front-page story Tuesday, The Sun quoted unidentified friends of <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> as saying he `` is besotted with Princess <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> and believes she loves him too.'' Under the banner headline `` Tim ` So In Love With <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>','' the rival <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> quoted other unidentified friends as saying they have had long telephone chats at night and have met secretly at a house in the country. Rumors have circulated since 1981 of trouble in the marriage of Princess <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>, 38, and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, a 40-year-old commoner and former captain in the Queen's Dragoon Guards. They were brought together by their love of horses but have led increasingly separate lives, spending about half of 1988 apart. On Sunday and Monday, the princess and <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> had separate schedules and did not see each other, then had only a brief reunion in the early hours of Tuesday. She arrived at their <LOCATION> Gatcombe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> estate in western <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> after midnight Monday and went horseback riding at 6 a.m. Tuesday. By the time she returned three hours later, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> was gone. His business agent, <PERSON> Taryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennelick </PERSON>, said he was `` somewhere in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>.'' His father, Maj. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, said his son was advising people who wanted to set up an equestrian center in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. `` There is no question of him running away,'' said the senior <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, 68. `` One is getting rather fed up with all the speculation. They have been getting along for the last 10 years without any problems.'' <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> kept public engagements in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> later Tuesday, including visits to research projects related to multiple sclerosis and muscular dystrophy at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Neurology </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> was on duty at <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION> as an equerry, or aide, to the queen. The Sun, which told <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard it would not reveal the contents of the letters, quoted one of <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON>'s friends Tuesday as saying: `` Obviously, <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> and the princess were physically attracted to each other, but their friendship goes deeper than that. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> has apparently filled a loneliness in her life and given her a shoulder to cry on when she needed someone to tell her troubles to. `` He understands her tantrums and the bad publicity she often attracts. But most of all, he cares for her in the way she believes her husband does not.'' There is royal precedent for divorce. The queen's only sister, Princess <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON>, divorced <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Snowden </PERSON> in 1978 and he has remarried. Because <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> is seventh in line to the throne and unlikely to become queen, a divorce would not threaten the monarchy.

<TEXT>
 Retired Supreme Court Justice <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Estey </PERSON> said Tuesday he will not hear new testimony in reviewing the disputed investigation of a 1985 Gander, <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>, airplane crash that killed 256 Americans `` I'm giving a legal opinion; I'm not holding a hearing,'' <PERSON> Estey </PERSON> said in a phone interview from his office in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. `` I'm sitting here reading tons of evidence.'' <PERSON> Estey </PERSON> agreed last month to review a three-year investigation by the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and deliver a report in 90 days on whether it was adequate or if further investigation or even a new inquiry is warranted. A letter from <PERSON> Estey </PERSON> to a transportation official, published Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Ottawa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION>, rejected requests that he hear new testimony. <PERSON> Estey </PERSON> said he had no direct comment on the Citizen's report, but remarked that the terms of reference for his 90-day review were to decide if a new hearing is needed and not to hold one now. The safety board's report on <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s worst air disaster was released in December after internal disputes that often went public. Five of the nine members approved the report saying the probable cause of the Dec. 12, 1985, crash was ice on the wings of the Arrow Air charter DC-8. Four members released a minority report saying an in-flight fire or explosion was the most likely cause. The plane carrying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers from <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peacekeeping duties to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Campbell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, crashed shortly after taking off from a refueling stop at <LOCATION> Gander </LOCATION>. Killed were 248 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen and eight crew. According to the letter obtained by the Citizen, <PERSON> Estey </PERSON> decided to base his review on existing records of the crash investigation. This upset some members of the safety board and families of crash victims, who hoped <PERSON> Estey </PERSON> would let them testify on why they believe a full-scale judicial inquiry into the disaster is warranted. In an April 5 letter to a <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> official, the <ORGANIZATION> Ottawa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> reported, <PERSON> Estey </PERSON> wrote he had heard some safety board members planned to submit new information. `` If I were to entertain submissions from board members, I believe that that would be both improper in law and would oblige me to hear submissions from all interested parties on an equal footing,'' it quoted the letter as saying. Transportation Minister <PERSON> Benoit </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouchard </PERSON> named <PERSON> Estey </PERSON> to review the investigation last month. <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, widow of pilot <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, wrote <PERSON> Estey </PERSON> last week asking to testify. She is among those trying to clear the name of <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, indirectly blamed for the accident by not having the plane de-iced before takeoff. `` This is not going to be an impartial review,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rusinowitz </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> supporter. `` The fact that we are being excluded is intentional. It's part of the game plan. It's a cover-up.''

<HEAD>GOP Lawmakers Introduce Child-Care Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENISE CABRERA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Republican legislators on Tuesday introduced a child-care bill that would offer a tax credit to low - and moderate-income families who care for small children at home as well as those who send their children to day-care facilities `` We're going to use the tax code of this country to put dollars in pockets of parents,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>, chief sponsor of the bill in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're not going to discriminate if they want to put their children in day care centers, they're going to have money to pay for it ... and essentially we're not going to discriminate if in these families the mother or father chooses not to work.'' The proposal recognizes `` every family has different circumstances,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, the bill's chief <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> sponsor. Republicans said their bill is an alternative to the Act for Better Child Care -LRB- ABC -RRB- bill that has been revived by Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>. They said their bill would serve more families, give the money directly to parents and not day-care providers, allow state and local governments and not the federal government to set day-care standards and not restrict eligibility to child care in center-based facilities. `` The tax credit approach is not a child care bill,'' responded <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaacson </PERSON>. He said the $ 1,000 credit proposed by the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> would cover just one-third of the average annual $ 3,000 child care costs families face. `` To propose child-care legislation and to dismiss the question of quality ... is to say that if you live in a state that has tough health and safety standards, congratulations, and if you live in a state that does not ... tough luck,'' said <PERSON> Isaacson </PERSON>. Republicans, including then-presidential candidate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, were critical of the Democrats' version of the bill in the past <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Current tax law provides tax savings up to $ 720 annually per child for a maximum of two children to help offset some expenses required for parents to get or keep a job. <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> initiative would help the majority of the nation's families whose children he said were not served in day-care center settings but were in home-based facilities. `` We now know that only about 12 percent of the children that we're talking about today are taken care of in child-care centers,'' <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> said. `` Eighty-eight percent of them are taken care of either at home by their parents; they're taken care of by relatives, they're in home-based kinds of day-care facilities so we think that we ought to help the 88 percent.'' The bill, called the Child Care Assistance Act of 1989 would: _ Provide a $ 1,000 refundable tax credit for the first child under age five and $ 500 each for up to two additional children. _ Expand the current dependent care block grants authorization to states to $ 300 million annually. _ Offer a 10 percent tax credit to employers for spending on dependent care assistance programs made available to employees. _ Establish a $ 75 million fund to assist states in establishing insurance liability pools to which any accredited child-care provider may belong. _ Authorize $ 25 million in revolving loan funds which family-based day-care providers could tap to help them make capital improvements to meet accreditation requirements. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers said $ 3 billion in potential tax revenues would be foregone during the first year of the bill, but they expected those revenues to be replaced. They did not say how that would happen.

 <LOCATION> Papua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>, facing a revolt on the remote island of <LOCATION> Bougainville </LOCATION>, has asked <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> to provide emergency medical aid to its troops after two were killed in weekend ambushes, the Australian government said Tuesday. The request for helicopters for rapid medical evacuation came after two soldiers were shot dead Sunday, apparently by militant landowners, bringing the death toll from in recent violence to six. The local landowners are opposed to foreign-controlled mining operations. Prime Minister <PERSON> Rabbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Namaliu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Papua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> said it appeared they were equipped with weapons from overseas. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Beazley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s defense minister, said <LOCATION> Papua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> made the request because Sunday's violence marked the first time its troops were killed in action. An aide to the Australian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> expects to respond favorably to the request. <LOCATION> Papua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>, with a 3.5 million mainly <LOCATION> Melanesian </LOCATION> population, is just north of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. It gained independence from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> in 1975. <PERSON> Namaliu </PERSON> did not give details of the clashes, but said: `` If it is established that foreign elements have been involved, we will pursue these criminals. This is truly a sad event in the nation's history. Tensions have been high on <LOCATION> Bougainville </LOCATION> for months after local landowners objected to profits being made from the island's copper mine, which ranks among the world's 10 biggest open cut mines. Last year, local landowners demanded the equivalent of $ 4 billion in compensation for mining operations and mounted a series of sabotage attacks that temporarily suspended mining operations. Local landowners also object to the presence of immigrant tribal highlanders who arrived in the 1960s and 1970s and have formed a large community, depriving many locals of employment. A spate of recent murders between the two groups has fueled the unrest. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s biggest mining company, <ORGANIZATION> CRA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, jointly operates the <LOCATION> Bougainville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Copper </LOCATION> mine, which is about 300 miles northeast of the mainland. The <LOCATION> Papua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> government also issued `` shoot-to-kill'' orders if further violence erupts, the Australian <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> said.

 The center-right government of Premier <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>, whose party suffered defeat in local elections last month, won a vote of confidence in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, 289 to 95. The 57 members of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> True </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> boycotted the vote in the one-house, 450-seat Parliament. The chief opposition, the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Populist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, voted against the government. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Motherland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has an overwhelming majority in the legislature. After the setback in local polling, <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> overhauled his Cabinet and then sought the confidence vote. About 300,000 workers meanwhile joined a campaign of passive resistance called by Turk-Is, the nation's largest labor union confederation, to protest what it said were low incomes at a time of high inflation. The protest includes a work slowdown, a boycott of company-provided luncheons, the growing of beards, a refusal to work overtime, and going for hospital visits en masse, said Turk-Is spokesman <PERSON> Erkin </PERSON> <PERSON> Okay </PERSON>. Turk-Is President <PERSON> Sevket </PERSON> <PERSON> Yilmaz </PERSON>, whose federation has 1.8 million members, said on Tuesday that the campaign was prompted by deadlock in contract negotiations for more than 600,000 workers employed by state agencies such as sugar factories, the <ORGANIZATION> Electricity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> and State Highways Department. In March 26 local elections, <ORGANIZATION> Motherland </ORGANIZATION> won only 22 percent of the vote nationwide and trailed both the Social Democrat and True Path parties. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> has vowed to stay on until his term ends in 1992, but many in his own party concede that early elections are inevitable and say <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> wants to delay the voting until 1990. He apparently hopes to win voter support if given more time to lower inflation, which reached 75 percent last year.

<TEXT>
 A House banking panel voted Tuesday to gut the key reform of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's savings and loan proposal, but then rolled back in several follow-up votes on some of the changes that most weakened the plan. By a 24-23 vote, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on financial institutions diluted a requirement to force S & amp; L owners to back loans with more of their own capital. The original weakening amendment, sponsored by Reps. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, D-Ill., and <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Parris </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., provided a much looser definition of what constitutes capital by including such balance sheet items as goodwill, subordinated debt, deferred loan losses and mortgage servicing Then, the subcommittee partly retightened the definition of capital regarding subordinated debt and deferred loan losses in subsequent votes of 28-19 and 26-21, respectively. However, the bill, as written so far, still would allow institutions failing to meet the standard to grow by about 7 percent to 8 percent a year. The administration wants to bar capital-deficient thrifts from expanding. `` We've come back some, but we're still concerned that we not have fictional capital,'' Assistant Treasury Secretary <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON> said after the votes. `` There are still problems. It is still not as good as the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> bill, but a small group of Democrats got <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> his ... capital standards,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who has been supporting the administration position. The subcommittee, with sessions scheduled Wednesday and Thursday, still faced long hours drafting other provisions of the bill, but members agreed the capital standards were the central reform accompanying President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal to spend $ 50 billion to close or merge failed S & amp; Ls. In the original vote to gut the provision, seven Republicans joined 17 Democrats in supporting the change. They were opposed by 11 Democrats and 12 Republicans. `` It really, really guts this bill. ... I would have to say it surrenders to the'' <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, the industry's chief lobby group, said Rep. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleczka </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, told panel members before the vote that `` we ought to have a little backbone'' and said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would veto any legislation with weak capital standards `` This amendment embraces one more time smoke-and-mirrors accounting and smoke-and-mirrors capital,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the full committee, which will review the version of the bill that eventually passes the subcommittee. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to increase S & amp; L capital requirements by June 1991 from 3 percent of assets to 6 percent, contending that the more capital S & amp; L owners have at risk, the less likely they will be to take undue risks and the greater the buffer standing in front of the government deposit insurance fund. <PERSON> Parris </PERSON> said his amendment, worked out over the weekend by aides to committee members, was `` absolutely not overgenerous to thrifts.'' He argued that if each element of the capital standards was separately debated, the end result would be an even weaker bill. However, so far, the individual votes have gone in the other direction. <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> said 1,091 solvent S & amp; Ls, more than a third of the industry, would fail to meet the administration's capital rules and would not be allowed to grow. `` In reality that is a death sentence,'' he said, adding, `` It must be pointed out that these 1,100 savings and loan institutions are not the bad guys. ... Rather, for the most part, these are institutions scattered throughout the country that were primarily engaged in home lending.'' Earlier, the subcommittee adopted, 30-17, a separate weakening amendment offered by Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>. The administration wants to encourage S & amp; Ls to get out of areas such as direct investment in real estate, insurance and junk bonds by requiring owners to back those investments entirely with their own capital. <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON>'s amendment exempts healthy thrifts already engaged in those businesses from the stricter standard. The panel also approved, on a 35-7 vote, a proposal by Rep. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON>, D-Ga., that would protect holding companies that bought sick <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls last year with the promise of government aid from having to absorb the costs if those institutions fail because the assistance is cut off <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> said the measure was aimed at preventing other S & amp; Ls under a holding company's umbrella from also failing because of a government failure to live up to the aid agreements. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> complained that the amendment would create a large loophole for holding companies to skirt any liability if the once-failed thrifts go under again. In other decisions, the subcommittee: _ Rejected, 31-14, an amendment by Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, D-Mass., proposing a sweeping change in accounting <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> would force banks and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls to value loans at their market price, rather than at their original worth. The change would have drastically altered the balance sheets of big banks with shaky loans to Third World countries. _ Rebuffed on a voice vote an attempt Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFalce </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, to get states with high numbers of state-chartered thrift failures, such as <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, to help pay for the bailout _ Protected the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> from political interference by extending, on a voice vote, the terms of board members to eight years and the terms of the chairman and vice chairman to five years

<HEAD>Military Vows To Intervene Again If `Institutional Order' Disrupted</HEAD>
<UNK>By EVA VERGARA ^Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s military, preparing to surrender power after 16 years of authoritarian rule, has vowed to intervene again if an elected civilian government does not maintain the present `` institutional order.'' That warning was issued by President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the army commander, and the chief of the military academy of strategic studies. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> led the coup that ousted the elected government of Marxist President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> in September 1973. In October, voters rejected a military proposal to extend <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s term until 1997. An open presidential election now is scheduled for Dec. 14 with the winner to take office next March 11. The 73-year-old <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, speaking Monday night in southern <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, said the armed forces must `` guard the constitutional order.'' `` That obliges us to make sure, without hesitation, that the sons of this land will not see the efforts of these years destroyed,'' he said. `` We will continue to work to ensure that those seeking political power are authentic democrats, who defend the model of a free society.'' Army Gen. <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>, commander of the military academy, delivered a stronger message Monday to hundreds of non-commissioned officers. `` If the institutional order is broken, the armed forces have the duty to restore it, using ... all the necessary means,'' he said. <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> said civilians must understand `` the role of the armed forces,'' and that role is not one of a policeman watching the country `` but to support the reign of law and the institutional order.'' Opposition leaders have denounced what the military calls the institutional order based on a 1980 constitution approved in a referendum. Opponents have centered their criticism on two issues: A constitutional article that allows <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> and the heads of the other military branches to remain as commanders until 1998, and the creation of a military-dominated <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to `` represent'' its views on crucial matters. No significant progress has been reported in negotiations between the government and opposition on possible constitutional changes. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> authorized the negotiations but said he would not allow changes in key articles. The army issued a communique Monday denouncing criticism of <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> and saying the army considered such criticism `` as addressed to each and all members of our institution.'' <PERSON> Genaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Arriagada </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the largest opposition party, responded. `` Pinochet is a politician and, as such, he is subject to criticism for his work and his public comments,'' he said. `` Even the army's high command is subject to criticism by the citizens.'' He said the continuation of <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> as army commander under a future civilian government `` is tantamount to establishing an armed state within an unarmed democratic state.''

<HEAD>California Water Program Renewed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, faced with a long-running fight over central <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> water, announced the renewal Tuesday of a long-term contract to supply water to farmers despite objections from environmentalists. But Interior Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> directed that an environmental assessment of the lease renewal be done and he suggested that state officials and other interested groups could solve any environmental problems. While the lease only involves the Orange Cove Irrigation District in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, the action is likely to set a precedent for other central <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> irrigation projects which serve farmers who also rely on the delivery of federal water through an elaborate system of dams and canals. Environmentalists have opposed a renewal of the long-term leases because they argue the leases lock the government into supplying a certain volume of water well into the next century at a time when rapid population growth also is putting new demands on non-farming water needs. As water continues to be diverted for both agriculture and urban use, streams will dry up and seasonal wetlands, which support migratory waterfowl, will disappear, the critics maintain. Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on water, power and offshore energy resources, sharply criticized the decision to resume renewing the leases at a time when there are uncertainties about their environmental impact `` This decision further corrodes the environmental credentials of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Block </PERSON>, an attorney who represents several environmental groups that have challenged the lease renewals, said, `` It's kind of backward to sign the leases and then order an environmental assessment.'' The Friant Unit of the Central Valley Project, as the huge irrigation system is called, receives 1.5 million acre-feet of water a year from <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reclamation </ORGANIZATION>, providing water for both large and small farms and orchards. The decision to renew the lease came as different agencies of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration also continued to disagree sharply on whether new <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> water contracts running 40 years should be issued without resolving all their potential environmental ramifications. After the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> indicated last November that it planned to renew the 40-year leases without first developing formal environmental impact statements, the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> challenged the leases, elevating the matter to the White House. More than a dozen environmental groups also protested and the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> filed suit in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> arguing that another 40-year water commitment is such a significant act that it requires a formal environmental assessment under the National Environmental Policy Act. A federal judge recently said, in response to the suit, the leases could be issued, but he reserved the right to void any such lease, depending on the outcome of the government debate over environmental issues. The president's <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> has scheduled meetings in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Thursday and Monday to gather information on the environmental issues surrounding the lease renewal controversy. While the presidential council has no authority to block the leases or order environmental assessments, its opinions on such matters historically have carried considerable weight among federal agencies and in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. In a statement, <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> said the department action on the Orange Cove lease renewal should not have an impact on the <ORGANIZATION> CEQ </ORGANIZATION> proceedings. He said he has ordered the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reclamation </ORGANIZATION> to proceed with an environmental assessment of continuing water deliveries to the massive Central Valley Project, of which <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cove </ORGANIZATION> is only a small part. `` The renewal of long-term water supply contracts may pose legitimate environmental concerns,'' said <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>, adding that the assessment he ordered should be `` considered by the state and -LRB- local -RRB- districts as they adopt environmentally sensitive operating procedures and water policies.'' `` That is essentially different than doing an EIS -LRB- environmental impact statement under federal law -RRB-,'' suggested <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanderson </PERSON>, director of the office of federal activities at the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. He said <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> officials are essentially `` sidestepping'' the National Environmental Policy Act in the procedures being used to consider the environmental issues. `` Our position -LRB- at <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- is the entire water issue for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> needs to be reviewed in light of today's environmental standards and particularly the environmental requirements 40 years hence,'' said <PERSON> Sanderson </PERSON> in an interview. <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> said the lease renewal would encourage increased water conservation among the farmers by charging `` substantially higher prices'' for the water. Uder the new contract with <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cove </LOCATION>, the cost of federal water would quadruple from $ 3.50 to $ 14.94 per acre foot, he said. An acre foot is an amount of water need to flood an acre of land one foot deep, or about 350,000 gallons.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s decision to stop jamming <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> presents an unparalled opportunity to spread American ideals and policies in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, an official said Tuesday in seeking new money for the U.S.-operated networks. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the publishing magnate and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that the greatest challenge for <ORGANIZATION> RFE </ORGANIZATION> @ RL is to respond to the end to jamming despite severe budget constraints. He said Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s new policy of openness has placed the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> `` at a crossroads of history.'' Soviet jamming stopped late last year, making the mission of <ORGANIZATION> RFE </ORGANIZATION> @ RL `` more important than at any time in its nearly 40-year history,'' <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can affect the nature and direction of reforms in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc by ensuring that all citizens of the region have access to the full range of information necessary for making intelligent political decisions.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>, an independent federal agency that oversees <ORGANIZATION> RFE </ORGANIZATION> @ RL, is seeking a $ 425.2 million appropriation in fiscal 1990 to beam its broadcasts into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. More than 55 percent of that amount _ $ 234.8 million _ is a one-time expense to complete modernization of <ORGANIZATION> RFE </ORGANIZATION> @ RL's transmitting system. About $ 207 million will go to build a new relay station in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, with the rest to be the final installment on a refurbishing program for existing relay stations that began in 1985. `` Funding of BIB modernization needs is critical in fiscal year 1990,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>, the agency's financial manager. `` This is very important for the Israeli relay station, so the major contracts can be let in 1990.'' The relay station will be used jointly by <ORGANIZATION> RFE </ORGANIZATION> @ RL and <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, the radio network operated by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, and will increase the stations signals by 300 percent in Central <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> beginning in 1992, <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, acting director of <ORGANIZATION> USIA </ORGANIZATION>, proposed a 1990 appropriation of $ 949.2 million at the hearing before a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee. <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said the budget request is a $ 66.9 million increase over this year, but that losses in funds from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and other cost increases will mean an actual cutback in <ORGANIZATION> USIA </ORGANIZATION>'s operating funds He said <ORGANIZATION> USIA </ORGANIZATION> will be forced to cut back <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>'s Greek and Turkish language broadcasts, close some relay stations and overseas posts and cut staff. House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> appropriations subcommittees have been supportive of the budget requests, but `` neither have made any promises,'' said an agency official who spoke only on condition of anonymity. The <ORGANIZATION> USIA </ORGANIZATION> budget does not call for any money for the controversial TV Marti project, which is to beam <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> broadcasts to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> USIA </ORGANIZATION> is negotiating with the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> for a 1990 budget amendment for TV <PERSON> Marti </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> USIA </ORGANIZATION>'s 1989 appropriation included $ 7.5 million in startup funds for TV Marti, which faces strong opposition from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> broadcasters who fear it will interfere with their TV signals. A presidential commission in January questioned TV <PERSON> Marti </PERSON>'s legality and technical feasibility Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, who is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, has opposed TV Marti, particularly in light of the Soviet decision to stop jamming <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> broadcasts in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two House panels gave unusually routine approval Tuesday to a $ 49.7 million aid package for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Contra rebels designed to carry out an agreement between President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> The House Foreign Affairs Committee approved the aid package _ always a source of virulent contention in the past _ on a 32-to-6 vote, and the Appropriations foreign operations subcommittee gave voice-vote approval to the package, which is expected to come before the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. The money is to keep up the flow of food, clothing and medicine to the roughly 11,000 rebel fighters encamped in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> along the Nicaraguan border through February of next year, when the leftist Sandinista regime has promised to hold national elections. It may be used, as well, to support `` voluntary reintegration'' of the rebels into Nicaraguan political life, assuming promised electoral and media reforms are made by the Sandinista government. Under the agreement announced March 24 at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the money may be cut off if the rebels engage in human rights abuses or in offensive military action. The bill would require no new money, instead transferring the aid funds from various Pentagon accounts. Later Tuesday, a companion bill providing the $ 49.7 million in Contra money was introduced in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and put on track for swift passage. The measure, offered by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, was referred immediately to the Appropriations and Foreign Relations committees, the latter of which planned a hearing Wednesday. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., said he was working with <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> on a time agreement for debating the plan and said he hoped the floor debate could come Thursday `` This legislation is the result of a great many hours of work by members on both sides of the aisle,'' said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said he wished there was sentiment in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to approve military aid to the Contras but conceded: `` The votes are n't there.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> then applauded <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> for striking the deal for humanitarian aid for the Contras, saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> needed to `` remain a player'' in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in case <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government reneges on commitments to democratic reforms. `` I'm not under any illusions that <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> is suddenly going to be a good boy in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said, referring to the Nicaraguan president.

A homemade videotape showed the helicopter going out of control suddenly while lowering the air conditioning unit. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, an investigator with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said he reviewed the videotape and concluded that the helicopter lost power to the tail rotor. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> gave the pilot credit for avoiding the building once he lost control. `` He did the best he could with it and brought it down,'' he said. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaberg </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> seaman, said he was watching the helicopter work when the vehicle's tail rotor hit the building and the aircraft went into a spin. <PERSON> Seaberg </PERSON> and others helped pull the pilot from the helicopter. Lt. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> estimated about 20 gallons of fuel leaked into the lake, but he said workers had the spill contained and were cleaning it from the water.

<HEAD>Open Letter Asks Bush To Lift Trade Embargo Against Nicaragua</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An open letter signed by about 600 international artists, religious leaders and academics asks President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> not to interfere in Central American peace efforts. It also urged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to lift the trade embargo against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government and called on the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to open talks with Nicaraguan leaders. Copies of the letter were released to journalists Tuesday by President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s press office. An aide said the letter would be published in other countries. Among the signatories were Cuban dancer <PERSON> Alicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Alonso </PERSON>, Spanish poet <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Alberti </PERSON>, American actor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Asner </PERSON>, Italian film director <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON>, Brazilian composer <PERSON> Chico </PERSON> <PERSON> Buarque </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Holando </PERSON> and American composer and conductor <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was asked about the letter, and he said: `` We want to continue to watch the situation in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, to keep the pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> for change, to keep the pressure on them to live up to their promises. We think there should be discussion between the parties involved.'' He also said Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> has raised the possibility of incentives to the Sandinistas if they make reform efforts but added, `` We would n't want to speculate on what that would be.'' There have been reports in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of a possible easing of the trade sanctions. The letter said the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nations should be allowed to `` resolve on their own their own affairs, without any foreign interference,'' and peace in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> `` must immediately be re-established.'' It said outside countries must support the accords reached by the five <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents Feb. 14 in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The letter told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, `` This is the moment for you to restore direct dialogue with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' There was no immediate response by <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> to the letter. At the February summit <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> promised to institute democratic reforms and to hold elections in February 1990, 10 months earlier than planned. In March his government freed nearly 2,000 former national guardsmen imprisoned since the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> won a civil war against the right-wing regime of President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> in 1979. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and the presidents of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> also agreed at the Februar meeting to produce by mid-May a plan for dismantling the force of Nicaraguan rebels known as Contras. An estimated 11,000 Contras have been living in border camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> since the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> cut off military aid to the rebels in February 1988. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> has criticized the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's proposal to provide up to $ 45 million in humanitarian aid to the Contras over 10 months.

<HEAD>April Chill Threatens Crops in the South</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Temperatures dipped below freezing Tuesday through much of the nation east of <LOCATION> Rockies </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, where farmers scurried to save their crops. More than 40 cities reported record lows. The low of 29 degrees at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> was a record April, and lows of 31 degrees at <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, and 26 at <LOCATION> Hot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, tied records for the month. Frost and freeze warnings were posted Tuesday night for parts of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> fruit growers assessed the damage from the cold snap that apparently cut heavily into peach, plum and strawberry crops. The cold wave sent temperatures into the upper 20s in many parts of the state and left behind dead or dying plums and peaches, officials said. Apple and pear crops weathered better because they had not yet bloomed as much as the peaches, plums and strawberries. In <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, a record low of 28 degrees had apple, peach and plum farmers worried about their crops. In <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, many growers rushed Monday night to light smudge pots and activate irrigation systems to save their crops as overnight lows dipped to the 20s in much of the state. In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, a record-breaking springtime snow hit the eastern part of the state early Tuesday, dusting streets and lawns but causing few problems other than delayed school openings. Morning snowfall totals in northeastern <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> reached 5 inches in <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, with 4 inches in <LOCATION> Currituck </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. By Tuesday afternoon, the snow had changed to rain or moved off the coast. The <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> basked in higher temperatures, with readings in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> in the 80s and 90s. Dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation, with sunny skies over much of the West and the Southeast. Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 31 degrees at Yellowstone National Park, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, to 93 degrees at Needles, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The nation's low for Tuesday was 9 degrees at <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>. The forecast for Wednesday called for snow showers scattered across the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION>; showers and thunderstorms in southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and the southern <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION>; and sunny skies over the rest of the nation.

 <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> agreed Tuesday to permit more <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> checkpoints of military observers along the <LOCATION> Afghan-Pakistan </LOCATION> border, where <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> says illegal aid from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is flowing to the Afghan rebels. Pakistani envoy <PERSON> Iqbal </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhund </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in emergency session that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has agreed to provide a permanent presence along the border to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> For <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, or UNGOMAP. This increased presence of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military observers, now numbering only 50, repeatedly was requested by <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, which allege <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is violating U.N.-mediated agreements on non-interference. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> denies the charges, but its agreement on the additional checkpoints is considered a minor concession. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> diplomats said they did not think it would have a significant impact. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> signed a U.N.-sponsored agreement in April 1988 calling for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Soviet troops entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979 to help the Marxist government fight U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas, and 100,000 soldiers were in the country before the withdrawal. <PERSON> Akhund </PERSON>, the prime minister's adviser on foreign affairs and national security, said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has agreed to provide new border checkpoints to <ORGANIZATION> UNGOMAP </ORGANIZATION> in border areas including <LOCATION> Chaman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Parachinar </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Torkham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nawa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION>. These are in the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Frontier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION> and in <LOCATION> Baluchistan </LOCATION>. Earlier, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> urged the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to take immediate action to stop what it called <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s `` full-fledged war'' against <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and to stop intervention by the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> army and militia. Aside from more <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> border checkpoints, it called for an international conference on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> fact-finding mission and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet efforts to persuade <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to stop aid to rebels. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON>, appealing to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, said, `` The question is why the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a big world power, becomes the tool for the implementation of Pakistani policies on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Why should the strategic interests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> be subdued to the expansionist designs of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in the region?'' <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which aids the Afghan rebels, denied all allegations of interference, massing its troops and taking part in the battle for <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, a key city in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The 15-member council was not expected to adopt any critical resolution or take action on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s complaint because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which backs <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, would veto any action. It adjourned after speeches from Afghan and Pakistani envoys. No further meeting was scheduled. The other permanent council members with veto power are <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which arms the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government against the rebels, is president of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> this month. Despite the withdrawal of Soviet troops in February, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> continue to arm the Afghan guerrillas and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> continues to resupply the <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> says it will halt its arms supplies if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does so, but the rearming continues and efforts to seek a political settlement and establish a broad-based government have faltered. The other council members are <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethipia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>.

 Hundreds of masked youths marched through the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s narrow streets Tuesday, waving outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags and carrying the coffin of a Palestinian killed by a Jewish gunman the day before. One policeman fired tear gas and another fired rubber bullets at stone throwers, wounding one in the leg, during the hourlong procession. Police said they had detained three Jews `` suspected to be linked to'' Monday's shooting, in which three other Palestinians were wounded. When the mourners reached the <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON> mosque compound, four young men climbed to the mosque roof and raised a large Palestinian flag while the crowd sang the Palestinian anthem `` Biladi, Biladi'' -LRB- My Homeland, My Homeland -RRB-. On Monday, a man dressed in army fatigues opened fire with an Uzi submachine gun near the <LOCATION> Jaffa </LOCATION> Gate entrance to the walled <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, killing <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Shawish </PERSON>, a 26-year-old blacksmith, and wounding three companions. He fired from a distance of about five yards and escaped on foot before police arrived. Police commander <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> <PERSON> Yehudai </PERSON> said he believed the killer was a reserve soldier. `` We seem to be speaking about an army reservist,'' he told <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television. `` There is a serious direction toward what I would call nationalist motives,'' he told <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television. Responsibility was claimed for an underground extremist group named after the Sicarites, the Jewish assassins who fought the Roman forces nearly 2,000 years ago. A man who said he spoke for the Sicarites told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> they would increase attacks `` to improve the situation of Jews'' in the occupied lands. About 70,000 Jewish settlers live in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which have a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> population of 1.7 million. Most merchants in Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> closed their shops in a three-day strike to protest the shooting. At <PERSON> Shawish </PERSON>'s house in a blind alley hung with two huge <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags, dozens of angry young men raised more flags and pictures of <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. They chanted: `` <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, do n't worry, we have people for you! God is great!'' Many wore improvised black masks or bags with eyeholes over their heads. Others had wrapped their faces in checkered scarves called keffiyehs. One masked protester told a journalist: `` The Israelis must choose if they want peace or war. We are not afraid of them. We want our state in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> its capital.'' As the funeral marchers moved through the cobblestone streets, their ranks grew to about 1,000. They circled the <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON> complex, a holy site of Islam that also houses the Dome of the Rock mosque, from which the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> is said to have ascended to heaven. Several of the young mourners attacked a nearby police station, smashing windows and doors with their fists, legs and rocks. A policeman responded with rubber bullets. Tension has increased in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, home to 350,000 Jews and the 135,000 Palestinians of east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. A riot outside <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON> on Friday spilled over into the area of the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest shrine. The holy sites are on <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION>, known in Arabic as <PERSON> Haram </PERSON> <PERSON> al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, or Noble Sancutary. Police retaliated by saying people who might riot, mainly young Palestinians from the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, would not be allowed to pray at <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> teen-ager wounded two <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> youths with a knife Tuesday, one of them seriously. The dispute apparently began over a parking space, but police spokeswoman <PERSON> Dalia </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilad </PERSON> said the possibility of an ethnic motive was being investigated. A general strike virtually closed the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The fundamentalist movement <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Zeal -RRB- urged it to protest <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s deportation of more than 40 Palestinians during the 16-month-old uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said Israeli soldiers firing on stone-throwers in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> wounded nine Palestinians, including a 90-year-old woman struck in the left leg. The army confirmed one of the wounded and said it was investigating the other incidents. The uprising has taken the lives of 423 Palestinians and 18 Israelis. In <LOCATION> Lod </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, a military court indicted two Palestinians on charges of belonging to illegal organizations. The defendants were identified as <PERSON> Saman </PERSON> <PERSON> Khouri </PERSON> ,41, and <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shalalda </PERSON>, 35, both of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> They were arrested March 5. The indictment accuses <PERSON> Khouri </PERSON> of being a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Shalalda </PERSON> of belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. It claims the two men prepared leaflets for the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and its underground leaders of the uprising in the occupied territories. <PERSON> Khouri </PERSON>, who worked as a correspondent for Agence France-Presse, also was accused of receiving $ 1.5 million from a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> organization in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and distributing it to PLO-affiliated groups in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Gang Ambush Raises Fear, Tension In City As Rival Gang Promises Revenge</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police said Tuesday they had leads to the youths who killed two people in a weekend drive-by shooting, and community leaders were waiting for the bloody revenge they fear is coming over the attack. Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON>, responding to the city's worst gang-related murders in 14 years, hinted he may ask the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to help free police for temporarily increased patrols in the city's drug-plagued southeast corner The weekend shooting that left two dead and nine injured spurred threats of revenge from a rival gang, including an ominous graffiti warning that promised `` 10 for one'' retaliation. `` It's really like a war zone here,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> of the Shipwreck, a church inside the embattled Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood. `` That's the climate over here right now.'' <PERSON> Goode </PERSON>'s church is about a mile from the corner where several men armed with assault rifles and shotguns opened fire early Saturday when they drove past a large crowd. The gunmen yelled `` Sunnydale'' before firing up to 60 shots into the crowd and two parked cars loaded with young people. Police said none of those killed or injured are known to have connections to the rival black teen-age gangs in Bayview-Hunters Point and the <LOCATION> Sunnydale </LOCATION> project in nearby <LOCATION> Visitacion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Sunnydale </LOCATION> youths, who call themselves the Swampy Desert Gang, and the Bayview-Hunters Point gang have been linked to more than 30 shootings in the past year. Police said they had leads, but would not discuss any details in connection with the attack, the worst gang incident since the 1975 <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dragon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massacre </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION> that left five dead and 11 injured. Police said the attack may have been Swampy Desert's retaliation for the slaying of <PERSON> Edric </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>, 19, who was killed by a sniper on Bayview-Hunters Point turf March 16. Gang tensions intensified when <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>'s funeral was held in Hunters Point. During the service, rival gang members angrily taunted one another while police kept the two groups apart. City Supervisor <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said Tuesday that the weekend shooting was more than just revenge by one gang against a rival. She said it appeared one gang was intent on attacks on anyone from their rival's neighborhood with no regard to gang affiliation. `` And that is different. That's scary. That's horrendous, because we have never had that kind of behavior on that scale,'' said <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, who's involved in a task force led by <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> which seeks to ease local tensions. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> believes crack cocaine is at the root of all the violence and gang battles plaguing southeast <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and other urban areas. `` It's a vicious, vicious circle and one causes the other and it's a whole domino effect,'' said <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, who also blasted the availability of assault rifles. <PERSON> Goode </PERSON>'s task force held a community meeting Monday night that attracted 125 parents, community leaders and youths to discuss gang problems and possible solutions. One of the ideas presented, <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> said, was formation of a community youth and family discussion group to resolve the communication gap he sees between parents and their children. `` I think that that's one of the things that we are trying to do here _ we really have to bring the families of these kids together,'' said <PERSON> Goode </PERSON>. `` Something has to be done. We have to address the needs of this community.''

 Fats Domino is <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>' latest pinup star _ four times over. Four identical portraits of Domino smile out of the 1989 <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jazz </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> poster, which was unveiled here Tuesday. `` That's just fine,'' the 62-year-old singer said of the poster. `` It represents when I was young and I like that about it.'' The poster was done by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> artist <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, who tinted 1960s pictures of Domino in four colors. `` After I was chosen to do the poster they told me they either wanted <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> or Fats Domino and I said ` Let's do Fats,''' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` I love them both, but people always kid me about how much I look like Fats.'' Domino, who said he works five to six months a year now, will play May 7 at the 20th annual Jazz Fest this year. `` I play there every couple of years. I been at it since I was 18 so I'm slowing down a little now,'' he said. Wherever he plays, <PERSON> Domino </PERSON> said, the crowds ask for his old hits, particularly `` Blueberry Hill.'' `` All I need is a good piano and a good mike and I'm happy,'' he said. `` I do n't care if it's 10 people or 4,000 _ as long as I see people enjoying themselves it makes no difference. I have a good time too.''

 A police records clerk said Tuesday that she was being fired from her job because she married another member of the police force, even though she and her husband have since filed for divorce. `` I'm going to appeal,'' said <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Atencio </PERSON>, whose marriage last August to Lt. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> placed their jobs in jeopardy because of the city's nepotism policy. <PERSON> Atencio </PERSON> and <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> filed for divorce last month in an effort to save their jobs. Despite that, <PERSON> Atencio </PERSON> said, Police Chief <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Evers </PERSON> decided to fire her as of April 20. It was not clear why she was singled out and not her husband. Evers and City Manager <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Achen </PERSON> did not return telephone calls seeking comment Tuesday and the police chief told a reporter waiting outside his office that he would have nothing to say about the case. <PERSON> Atencio </PERSON> has worked in the police department for nine years and her husband for 16. She said she was n't interested in another city job that paid less than her current job. `` I ca n't afford a cut in pay,'' she said. `` I was left destitute after my -LRB- previous -RRB- divorce and I'm not going to let that happen again.'' The 34-year-old mother of three children said she `` did n't marry <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> for him to support my kids.'' City officials say that <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>, as administrative services lieutenant, is in charge of <PERSON> Atencio </PERSON>'s direct supervisor and as such has control over his wife's job. <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Atencio </PERSON> say that because <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> does n't directly supervise his wife, they are n't violating the nepotism policy. <PERSON> Atencio </PERSON> said the couple filed for divorce March 13 after city personnel director <PERSON> Claudia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelhurst </PERSON> agreed that they would be given more time to find new jobs `` if we could show intent to divorce and documentation that divorce proceedings were under way.'' <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> law requires at least 90 days before a divorce becomes final.

 Donors pledged all $ 133 million needed to stockpile food in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> before the rainy season isolates villages, but a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said Tuesday not all Sudanese who need help can be reached. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lifeline </ORGANIZATION> and director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Children's Fund, told reporters the goal of aiding 1 million people and preventing more than 100,000 deaths by starvation `` may be unrealistic, but it's what is needed.'' `` We have no alternative but to try.'' The operation hopes to move 110,000 tons of food to isolated villages in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> before the rains begin in May, washing out roads and airstrips. In August 1985, at the height of the Ethiopian famine, international agencies delivered only 85,000 tons of food under far more favorable conditions. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> estimates 250,000 Sudanese starved to death last year because of flood, drought or war-induced famine. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said about 22,000 tons of food have been delivered so far, divided about equally between areas controlled by the Moslem-dominated government in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> and rebel areas in the south, which is mainly Christian or animist. The emergency program had received $ 77 million in pledges by the time <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> led a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> planning conference a month ago in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> and received pledges for te rest of the $ 133 million needed at a donor pledging meeting Tuesday. Pledges include $ 11 million from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, $ 10 million from the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, and the donation by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> of the services of four Transall aircraft to carry relief supplies, said <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> denied reports that <LOCATION> Juba </LOCATION> in southern Sudanese was cut off from airlifts by threats from the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> or that <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> closed its border to food convoys. `` There is no cease-fire,'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> acknowledged, but he said two relief flights are reaching <LOCATION> Juba </LOCATION> daily.

<HEAD>Bush Administration To Appeal Wheelchair Lifts Ruling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE LLOYD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal government wants to appeal a decision requiring wheelchair lifts on all new public buses, saying the ruling would cost the nation's mass transit systems $ 90 million a year. Groups representing the disabled praised the Feb. 13 ruling by the 3rd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> as a means to help put handicapped people into the mainstream, but transit agencies said the costly lifts are rarely used. In petitioning Monday for a rehearing by the full court, the government said the ruling contradicted <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' intent. In addition, the government argued, the court failed to comprehend the full cost of the order. In the 2-1 decision, the court ordered the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> to rewrite regulations that allow communities to offer only `` paratransit'' service, such as van rides, to the disabled. The court said the 24-hour reservations that van riders need hindered spontaneous use of mass transit. The judges said instead that all new buses must be equipped with lifts. Since the decision, disabled people nationwide have demonstrated in hopes of persuading the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to allow the ruling to stand. The case was brought by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disabled </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accessible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> and other groups for handicapped people. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gold </PERSON>, an attorney for ADAPT, said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's decision to appeal is `` a slap in the face'' and renders the president's pledge of a `` kinder, gentler nation'' a hollow promise. ` It'll keep disabled people out of the mainstream and out of jobs for years and years to come,'' he said. In its petition, the government argued the legislation does not require `` wholesale restructuring of mass-transit services or imposition of the attendant financial burdens on an already overburdened public transportation system.'' The government said transit agencies across the country would pay $ 90 million a year for the lifts. In addition to $ 10,000 for each lift, the government said, maintenance and operating expenses would add $ 9,600 over 12 years.

 Dense smoke from fires in dried-up <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> wetlands cloaked <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Tuesday, cutting visibility, alarming senior citizens with breathing problems, and leading to evacuation of an alien detention camp. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigration officials closed their busy office building because of the choking fumes. State troopers briefly closed a stretch of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 41, the southernmost east-west route across <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, because of near-zero visibility. No accidents were reported. `` From the window, it looks like the city is in flames,'' said <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> Fire Lt. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>. `` You ca n't see across the bay -LRB- to downtown <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> -RRB- and it's getting worse.'' Brush fires are normal in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> this time of the year, but are more numerous and intense this season because of an unusually dry winter. Health alerts were issued because of the choking haze, which meteorologists said was lessened by evening seabreezes but would remain a problem until predicted northeast winds moved in Wednesday morning. `` I came here for sun and I got smoke _ figure that out,'' said <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a tourist from <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, as he squinted into the haze. Fires licked to within a mile of the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Krome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on the edge of the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> district director, ordered the 700 aliens there moved to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Maduro </PERSON> Baseball Stadium. <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> said if conditions did n't improve by early Wednesday, the aliens could be sent by bus to an immigration camp in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isabel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` It's very serious. We've got an emergency,'' said <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON>, who earlier closed the downtown INS headquarters, which is usually jammed with people. The Maduro stadium, spring training home of the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> major-league team, was recently used as a makeshift home for Nicaraguan refugees. <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean-Juste </PERSON>, a leader of the Haitian exile community, protested shifting Haitian aliens to the outdoor stadium instead of letting them go to churches or homes in the Little <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> community. `` These people suffered in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, they suffered in <LOCATION> Krome </LOCATION>. They should at least let the pregnant women and children go,'' he said. <PERSON> Jean-Juste </PERSON> dropped his protest when <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> allowed several pregnant women and children to spend the night in the care of Haitian community groups. The smoke from fires 20 to 30 miles away blocked the sun, and jets were barely visible as they took off from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, where officials said normal operations continued despite the haze. Tourists expressed puzzlement when they walked outside to find they could barely see the beach at the Fontainebleau Hilton Hotel. `` It's kind of weird,'' said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, a hotel publicist and lifelong <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> resident. `` I thought my garage was on fire this morning, the smoke was so heavy,'' said <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasher </PERSON>, a federal courthouse secretary who lives in suburban <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> advised people with respiratory problems to stay indoors. Some senior citizens who woke up coughing were alarmed, hospital officials said. `` Fear becomes an integral part of the problem for us. They panic and call rescue,'' said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Davison </PERSON>, who said several had called for emergency transport to <ORGANIZATION> Pembroke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> while others flooded the southwestern <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> hospital's switchboard. At <ORGANIZATION> Greenbriar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nursing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, whose 175 patients all suffer from respiratory ailments, workers tried to make sure windows and doors were kept shut. `` As this smoke comes into the building, even you or I would experience shortness of breath or a feeling of headache,'' said administrator <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>. `` For people who already have respiratory problems, you ca n't have open doors.'' He said visibility around the southwest <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> center was less than a quarter-mile. Forestry officials said 3,000 acres of dried-out sawgrass were in flames west of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> firefighters have put down four major brushfires near populated areas since last weekend. One blaze had burned an estimated 12,000 acres, firefighters said. Two fires were reported in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grasslands. Brushfires have also sprung up sporadically in other parts of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in recent days. Last week, a series of fires charred 58,000 acres along central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION>.

 It was a sentimental moment for country's top entertainer <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the rowdy Southerner notorious for wild party songs, when he upstaged <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s artist of the decade proclamation It appeared to be <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s night early during Monday night's 24th annual Academy of Country Music Awards presentations as the country rockers joined <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Loretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> in the prestigious artist-of-the-decade ranks The band has won 13 ACM trophies since 1982, and has had 21 consecutive No. 1 singles, including `` Feels So Right,'' `` The Closer You Get,'' `` Roll On'' and `` You've Got the Touch.'' But the evening was stolen by <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who beat <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> again for his third consecutive entertainer of the year award, when he accepted his trophy before the crowd of 1,600. `` I did n't think I was going to get the first one,'' said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, son of the legendary singer-songwriter who died in 1953. `` I'm a late bloomer, a survivor, a fighter, a contender. `` I can be a champion, but I'm nothing without all of you in this room and all the fans out there.'' While on stage, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> referred to his current hit record and video, the much-talked about father-son duet `` Tear in My Beer'' using an old demo tape his father made decades ago. He earlier performed the song, which featured a stirring video interplay with his late father. `` The video with daddy was the most special thing I ever did in my life,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said, choking back tears and biting his lip in a bid for composure. The two-hour, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark-produced </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> special fared well in the ratings, winning the time slot and luring a larger national audience than last month's Grammy Awards. If there was a surprise, it was <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> leaving the show empty-handed, despite three nominations. He's won eight ACM trophies since 1986 and earlier this year won an American Music Awards and a Grammy Award. K.T. <PERSON> Oslin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattea </PERSON> each won two awards, Miss <PERSON> Oslin </PERSON> for album of the year and best female vocalist and Miss <PERSON> Mattea </PERSON>'s `` Eighteen Wheels and a Dozen Roses'' for year's best record and song <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Strait </PERSON> won in the male vocalist category.

 Attorneys for a group of bondholders said Tuesday that a $ 750 million settlement in the $ 2.25 billion <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> default case was the best deal they could get. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> heard the appraisal at a hearing on how to distribute money from settlements made late last year in the <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> fraud case, the biggest default in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> municipal bond history. The settlement must be divided among more than 24,000 plaintiffs and attorneys. However, representatives of a separate group of bondholders in the class-action suit said they will argue that no settlement should be allowed until after the court decides individual bondholders' and attorneys' shares in the settlement. The attorneys also want to argue that the state of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Bonneville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> should bear more responsibility for their roles in the case. The legal action grew from <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>' 1983 default on $ 2.25 billion in bonds sold to finance two nuclear power plants that were abandoned before completion. <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, a plaintiff attorney, said he and other attorneys for bondholders felt that the best they might achieve if they won the case was a $ 1.4 billion settlement. The $ 750 million settlement was much more realistic, `` and it could well be much less,'' said <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said he recognized it's `` a horrible thing'' for people to lose money that could have meant their retirement or savings for education, but `` we also understand if you get nothing, it's nothing. Attorneys for the bondholders unhappy with the settlement promised to press their argument before <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>. `` We have a hard fight,'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffer </PERSON>, who is pursuing a separate class-action suit against the state of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on behalf of bondholders, said Monday night. `` But we're not going to give up.'' Defendants in the federal lawsuit, which incorporated dozens of separate suits filed as early as 1983 in federal court in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, included the supply system, the 88 utilities that contracted with <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> to build the two plants, engineering firms, the Wall Street bond underwriters, utility and <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> directors and the advisory firm of <ORGANIZATION> Blyth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION>.

 Civil guards defused two more package bombs in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> Tuesday in what appeared a drive by Basque separatists to unnerve the government following a breakdown in talks between the two sides in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>. A bomb sent to <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrionuevo </PERSON> was opened by a ministry employee but a faulty triggering device kept it from exploding, officials said. <PERSON> Barrionuevo </PERSON> is a former interior minister who led the fight against the Basque separatist group <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> for nearly six years. Earlier Tuesday, experts defused a package bomb addressed to an army sergeant in a military mountain training school in the Pyrenees.

No group claimed responsibility, but police blamed the <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION>, which has fought for 21 years for self-determination for <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s northern Basque Country Two other package bombs were sent Monday and Friday, and one maimed a high school gym teacher.

 A fire that turned into a `` real witch's brew'' of dangerous chemicals burned itself out after about 1,600 people were evacuated and 17 were taken to hospitals, authorities said Tuesday The fire at <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediates </ORGANIZATION>, a company that blends chemicals for pharmacies and other businesses, started about 6 p.m. Monday, and burned through the night. It kept people from their homes for more than 12 hours. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> housed 357 people at an evacuation center set up at <ORGANIZATION> Buena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> until they were allowed to return home at 5:15 a.m. Tuesday, about 75 minutes after the fire burned itself out. One hundred people were ordered to evacuate and another 1,500 were asked to leave their homes voluntarily, said <ORGANIZATION> Ventura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> Dispatcher <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Crabtree </PERSON>. The unincorporated town of Saticoy is about 75 miles northwest of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Noxious fumes sent 17 people to hospitals, firefighters said. All were treated and released except <ORGANIZATION> Ventura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capt </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, who was in stable condition Tuesday at <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Thousand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION>. The fire's cause was still under investigation Tuesday, Ms. <PERSON> Crabtree </PERSON> said. She said there was no damage estimate yet. The 35,000-square-foot industrial building housed several businesses, but only the chemical plant and an auto repair firm were gutted. <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediates </ORGANIZATION> had stocks of several kinds of hazardous and toxic chemicals, including cyanide, hydrogen, corrosives, and several materials that react violently with water, said fire Capt. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Kruschke </PERSON>. With the mix of chemicals and fire, he said: `` We do n't know exactly what we're coming up with here. It becomes a real witch's brew for us. More than 130 firefighters were sent to the plant, but they could not spray water on the chemicals. Besides the fear of chemical reaction, there was concern that water runoff would contaminate the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kruschke </PERSON> said. `` The best thing to do is just let it burn itself out,'' <PERSON> Kruschke </PERSON> said. Firefighters said <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediates </ORGANIZATION> was cited last year for having larger quantities of chemicals than allowed on its premises. The citation for violating county ordinances has yet to reach court, they said.

 Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said in an interview published Tuesday that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s proposed elections in the occupied lands could take place in six months if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can persuade `` whoever needs to agree to elections.'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> did not mention the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> that began in December, but repeated several times that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will have to play to play a major role in negotiating the elections process, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. It quoted unidentified Israeli officials as saying a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> envoy was expected to open talks next month. The paper quoted <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> as saying it would be possible to have Palestinians from outside the occupied lands take part in the negotiations on the final status of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. He offered no names but mentioned past proposals to include prominent <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> professors in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, it added. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, of the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said he believed elections were possible within six months but that Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> thought nine to 12 months would be needed. `` I presume that the Americans, who support the idea, will do all they can to persuade whoever needs to agree to elections,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> was quoted as saying. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, leader of the rival right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, said Monday he stood by his view that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> could play no role, even indirectly. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, in a statement issued Monday by its <ORGANIZATION> WAFA </ORGANIZATION> news agency, rejected the <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> plan. It said elections could be held only under international supervision after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> withdraws from the lands it has occupied since capturing them from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON>, a prominent Palestinian moderate in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said Tuesday elections were a possibility even without complete <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> withdrawal. But he said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would have to deal at least indirectly with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and link the vote to an overall negotiating strategy that promised a land-for-peace trade. <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s suggestions `` are suspended in thin air without any regard to the future. They are trying to sidestep talking about land for peace and withdrawal by trying to spotlight elections.''

<HEAD>Belgium Wants To Delay Nuclear Arms Upgrading</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The government said Tuesday it wants <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to delay a decision to modernize its short-range nuclear arms until the early 1990s and agree to open <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> arms talks about these weapons as soon as possible. `` By adopting this position, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> hopes to contribute to.. arms control and disarmament,'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Wilfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> told a joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s defense and foreign affairs committees. By seeking a delay, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> joins <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where the issue has caused political friction. Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said recently he wants any production decision delayed until 1991 or 1992, after important elections in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> next year. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> seek an early commitment to modernization. <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> defended a delay by pointing to a new climate of detente and a more moderate leadership in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> alliance nations evidently can not remain insensitive to the policy of perestroika and glasnost,'' he said. <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> said Defense Minister <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Coeme </PERSON> would present <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s view to a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense ministers meeting in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> next week He said no decision to upgrade short-range nuclear arms should be taken before 1991-92, adding that `` the government hopes negotiations on ... -LRB- such -RRB- arms can begin as soon as possible.'' `` The government will do all it can to achieve that goal. It is determined to open an active diplomatic action, both within <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>... and in bilateral contacts. He said <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> agreed the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> should `` maintain tactical nuclear arms, where needed, without significant increases in their ranges.'' <PERSON> Martens </PERSON>' announcement was seen as reflecting a compromise on nuclear arms within his center-left coalition government. The Socialist partners of Christian Democrat <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> strongly oppose an early modernization decision. <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> referred to Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program of economic and political reforms which he said were of `` historic importance. The prime minister said a delay to modernize was entirely consistent with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> efforts to draft a comprehensive overview of its defense needs over the next decades. This overview, under study since June 1987, is to be released at a summit meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> on May 29-30. Within <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> want quick approval of plans to boost the range of the 700 nuclear-armed <LOCATION> Lance </LOCATION> missiles from 65 to roughly 250 miles by the mid-1990s. This is part of a modernization program that also covers artillery shells and replacing free-fall bombs with air-to-ground missiles. The new Lances and the air-launched missiles would be deployed as of 1995. The gun shells already have been upgraded or are being improved. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> want to move ahead on the new Lances now so the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can allocate the required research and development funds. The two countries oppose negotiations about these weapons. `` We can not accept negotiations about short-range nuclear arms,'' a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> source at <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` We think these weapons are necessary to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> strategy. There are the only -LRB- nuclear -RRB- weapons left in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' he said, following U.S.-Soviet accord to remove ground-launched, medium-range nuclear missiles. The source said an alliance commitment to the new <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> does not imply a decision to produce the missiles. `` What we want -LRB- from the allies -RRB- is a signal so that the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can proceed with funds for research and development,'' he said, adding that such a signal would go a long way to stifle congressional complaints that the European <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies do not pull their weight in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted 7-6 Tuesday night to approve a two-year contract keeping embattled <PERSON> Laval </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> in charge of the nation's oldest school system. The decision on the divisive issue was made on the deadline set by the board. It was announced by committee President <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> after members met behind closed doors for about two hours. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said he was delighted with the vote and looked forward `` to continuing to work for the young people of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>.'' He admitted having had some differences with committee members but said he believed he could work with them productively. `` It's not a working situation,'' retorted committee member <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cappucci </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> opponent. `` I do n't see how Dr. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> thinks he'll be able to get anything done. `` If I were him, I'd see the handwriting on the wall, realize what I've tried to do has n't worked and bow out,'' <PERSON> Cappuci </PERSON> said. `` He is not the man for the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> job.'' But committee member <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Nucci </PERSON>, who supports <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, said it was everyone's duty to try to make the uneasy union work. `` I hope they realize that personal vendettas have to be put aside in the interest of the school system,'' <PERSON> Nucci </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> had spent the past two weeks trying to work out a new contract with three of the school committee members. Under Tuesday night's action, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> is subject to a professional review every six months, at which time the committee can reconsider his contract. The arrival of <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, whose four-year contract expires in June, was heralded as a mature step for <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. A black man was going to run schools in a city that erupting in racial violence over federal court-ordered busing in 1974. Only days after <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> was hired, he asked for and got a $ 15,000 raise, to make his yearly salary $ 85,000. Since then, white flight to private schools has left the system mostly black. Of the system's 1972 enrollment of 96,000, 60 percent was white. Today, there are 59,000 students, 24 percent of them white. Critics of the 53-year-old <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> native complain he is aloof and autocratic. `` This is n't a racial issue, it's a competence and quality issue,'' school committee member <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis-Mullen </PERSON>, who is white and is one of <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s fiercest detractors, said Monday. `` He's a diligent worker, but his approach is n't meeting the needs of the children of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>.'' `` He lacks the insight and the philosophy that this system needs to move forward,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON> said. `` Although we've had $ 100 million added to the budget -LRB- now $ 361 million -RRB- since Dr. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> arrived, the dropout rate has increased.'' Supporters praise <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s hard work and honesty, saying he needs more time. `` You really ca n't get anything done changing horses in <LOCATION> midstream </LOCATION>. Just changing who it is right now is n't going to change a thing,'' said <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>, a former school social worker and one of four black school committee members. In a self-assessment requested by the <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> gave himself high marks for dedication and for raising math and reading scores on national standardized tests and for lowering the dropout rate. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> says fewer youngsters are quitting school each year. The school system figures, however, show increasing attrition in class size between ninth grade and graduation day. The Class of 1983 was 33 percent smaller than when it began; the Class of'87 eroded by 40 percent.

 If <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Alonso </PERSON> is a young <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>, his parents do n't want to make too much of a fuss about it. That's why they whisked the 5-year-old out of their native <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, where the press hailed him as a genius and a virtuoso, and enrolled him in kindergarten at the <ORGANIZATION> Mackintosh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, a school for gifted children in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. `` We wanted him to get a well-rounded education, and be with children his own age who are more like him,'' said <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Alonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Plaza </PERSON>, 29, <PERSON> Diego </PERSON>'s mother. She and her husband, Manual, 49, are amateur musicians who set out to create a musical child. While pregnant they played scales to the fetus because, she said, `` we love music, and we think music is very important for the development of the child's mind _ the creative, abstract mind.'' <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> began singing scales when he was 6 months old, his parents say, and at 2 began to read music. At 3, he could play simple <PERSON> Bach </PERSON> pieces on the piano. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, a teacher at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> who tested Diego, said the 3-year-old showed exceptional gifts and could listen to music and then play it back by memory. <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> said <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> should not be schooled with children his own age. In February 1988, when he was 4, <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> had an audience before <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sofia </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, but declined to play. Instead, he showed the queen a game he played in which he stands with his back to a piano and identifies any note that is struck. All the attention, however, soon made Diego stop playing for several months. He was, after all, only 4, and according to his parents has a stubborn streak. `` It was too much pressure,'' his mother said. So they brought him to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this fall and to the <PERSON> Mackintosh </PERSON> school. In <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, he has had to learn English, and he takes piano lessons and dance classes after school. But he practices piano only about five minutes a day, and his parents say they do n't want to force him to concentrate on his music any more than that yet. `` We think, little by little, he'll do it,'' <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Alonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Plaza </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaak </PERSON>, <PERSON> Diego </PERSON>'s piano teacher in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, says he is exceptional for his age and has perfect pitch, but the child would love to do anything else but play the piano. `` He has put up certain barriers. He would n't want to be forced to sit there,'' she said. `` The potential is there. ... It depends what he does with it. He certainly has the intelligence.'' She said his coordination was about average for a 5-year-old. Eve <PERSON> Mackintosh </PERSON>, the director of the school, calls the boy a genius who has caught on quickly in all subjects. She thinks his IQ is higher than the 139 at which he tested when he was 4. <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Alonso </PERSON>, a former secretary and a violinist, played scales and repetitive melodies on the violin at least three times a day at regular intervals while she was pregnant _ `` at the same beat as the mother's heart.'' Manual, who worked for the telephone company in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, plays the piano. He said <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> showed an early fascination with the instrument, peeking around his father's back to watch him play and crawling underneath the piano to watch the pedals move. The couple filled their home with classical music during the pregnancy, and when <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> was born they would sing him to sleep with scales. The Alonsos are unemployed in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, writing a book about child-rearing and hoping for an extension of their visa, which runs out this month. Living on savings, they are not sure how long they will stay in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> but would like Diego to finish eighth grade at Mackintosh before returning to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for high school. Diego is on a partial scholarship at <LOCATION> Mackintosh </LOCATION>, and the Alonsos are hoping a foundation or university will step in and help support his education. But they do n't like the child to be bothered by the press, and asked that reporters and photographers not talk to <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> at school because that might draw attention to him. In a recent music class at the academy, however, <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> drew attention all by himself. When music teacher <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> asked each child in the kindergarten class to name their favorite musicians, <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> pulled up two names many of the children could barely pronounce: <PERSON> Tchaikovsky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rachmaninoff </PERSON>.

 Call it the Heartland. Call it <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Call it <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Hometown. But, please, just call _ especially if you're a big-time journalist who can put this High Plains town in the national news. Imbued with a new sense of pride _ and a hunger for publicity _ after President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> styled <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> a barometer for national opinion, civic leaders want the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> press corps to make a habit of asking <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> what <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> thinks of national issues, from the minimum wage to arms control. `` <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, Phone Home,'' was the headline of a full-page ad <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> officials ran in the <LOCATION> Washington-Baltimore </LOCATION> edition of The Wall Street Journal recently to kick off a campaign to promote this city of 187,000 as everybody's hometown. The ad closed with the city's new slogan: `` Look. Listen. <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>. Now.'' `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has really given us something we can rally around,'' said <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, a local advertising executive who helped think up the slogan. The city is buying advertising, buttons and T-shirts to capitalize on all the free publicity <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> handed it. Notoriety hit the city when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recounted during a nationally televised news conference a conversation with an old friend in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, who told him `` all the people in <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> think things are going just great.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s story took city leaders by surprise. But it did n't take them long to see they were getting the kind of publicity money could n't buy. After reporters stopped calling and the crews from `` Good Morning, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' took their lights and cameras out of the local pancake house, <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>'s leaders went to work devising ways to stay in the spotlight. `` We felt that this was an opportunity we should take advantage of,'' said Mayor B.C. `` Peck'' <PERSON> McMinn </PERSON>, who treasures a handwritten note from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> thanking <PERSON> McMinn </PERSON> for his comments about <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> residents' support of the president during the media onslaught. `` It's just been feeding on itself.'' <PERSON> McMinn </PERSON> even got a congratulatory call from <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloof </PERSON>, mayor of the town made famous by the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration's, `` Will it play in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>?'' `` All of a sudden we were propelled into the limelight,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>, executive vice president of the city's industrial development board. He hopes greater awareness of <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> might bring the west <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> city more jobs, tourists and conventions. City officials are n't sure what the whole campaign will cost They spent $ 6,100 on the Wall Street Journal ad. It's too early to look for results, but the attention showered on this agriculture-based town already has spawned envy among other midsized cities. `` There are a lot of other <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> cities that want me to get the President to mention their cities,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>. While <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> does n't boast about its crime rate, with a burglary incidence that's among the highest in the nation, or the dust that swirls through town from the surrounding cotton fields each spring, being <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Heartland makes the city an easier sell, <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON> said. `` We're not just another city out looking for new business. We're <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> and that's a unique term now.'' Others express the more altruistic desire that <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>'s example will remind politicians the `` real <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' knows and cares what's going on in the nation's capital `` It does n't take a genius to realize that there are many cities in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> just like <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>,'' said the ad. `` And how they think and how they feel about national and international issues is a barometer our leaders ` inside the Beltway' should never ignore.''

<TEXT>
 One of the most abrupt changes ever taken by those who seek to direct the American economy's course occurred about 15 years ago under circumstances somewhat similar to those of today. It was during the administration of <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, and inflation was on everyone's mind. The popular patriotic slogan of the day was `` Whip Inflation Now.'' It was printed on lapel buttons and splashed in advertisements. The campaign had an ignominious ending when the facts were realized _ that the nation was stumbling into recession and that recession far more than inflation was the big threat to the economy. It was not the first time the economic ship of state had been nearly driven onto the shoals and it was n't the last either. Almost all of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s recent presidents have been accused of erratic or even irresponsible steering. In relatively recent history, for example, <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> have suffered criticisms for their tenure at the wheel. But nothing quite matches the abrupt realization in 1974 that the economy was headed to recession while all eyes were on inflation. And now, some critics contend there could be a repeat of the scenario in 1989. These critics can not as yet demonstrate their thesis by means of the popular statistics, which show the economy still has some forward momentum. But when you're steering a ship as big as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy you never really know. When you flip the control buttons or turn the wheel a few degrees, for example, nothing seems to happen. A big ship does n't turn on a dime; it takes time to observe a change And when change comes you can not reverse it quickly. In effect, gloomy analysts are saying that maybe too many buttons have been pushed already, and that while we have n't seen the effect so far it is bound to show up in the next few months. Therefore, they say, beware of recession. Adding conviction to their fears, or vice versa, is the uncanny coincidence of the same man being in the control room. In 1974, as chairman of the President's <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> led the inflation fight. Today, as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, he has given inflation priority over recession. Few economists doubt <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s knowledge, or that he is capable of absorbing wisdom from experience, but one of them, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinemann </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ladenburg </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Thalmann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a securities firm, offers this typical cautionary view: `` In sum, we think the economy is vulnerable. A slowdown, if not worse, is in the cards. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s zeal to Whip Inflation Now is commendable. But let's hope he does n't give us a replay of the crunch of 1974.'' The question, says <PERSON> Heinemann </PERSON>, is whether <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> will get the mild slowdown he wants, `` or will we go through something more sinister?'' In short, will the economy scrape bottom and continue on its way? Or will it run aground, spring a leak and spill its energy like the Exxon Valdez?

 Villagers in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> got their wish. The Irish government has decided to keep its 750-man batallion in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping forces here. The government in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> had been reconsidering the Irish battalion's presence in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> because four of its soldiers had been killed and one wounded in three attacks in the past three months. Three of them were killed by a landmine March 21. `` We greatly need the Irish contingent in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fawaz </PERSON>, the mayor of <LOCATION> Tibnin </LOCATION>, a town 11 miles north of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> border. The estimated 100,000 Shiite Moslems living in 20 hamlets around <LOCATION> Tibnin </LOCATION>, the Irish headquarters, `` enjoy their protection,'' <PERSON> Fawaz </PERSON> said. Before making the decision, the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> reviewed a report by Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Tadhg </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, chief of staff of the Irish army, who had come here to investigate the landmine explosion March 21. The Cabinet renews <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s commitment every six months, and the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> political opposition had called for a policy review after the deaths. The fourth death occurred earlier. `` Our presence here is very vital to the security of the area and to the locals who depend on our humanitarian aide,'' said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON>, commander of the Irish contingent in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. On March 30, hundreds of <LOCATION> Tebnin </LOCATION>'s 5,000 residents participated in a memorial ceremony for the three Irish soldiers killed by the landmine. `` The Irish contingent lives among its people in the south,'' said one of the banners at the ceremony. `` Aggression against it is aggression on the southerners.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force, made up of 5,800 personnel from nine nations, has monitored a narrow strip of 65 towns and villages in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since March 1985. The population in the force's area of operation increased from about 50,000 when the force first arrived to about a half million people today. `` Before <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> came to south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> ... the area was a free terrain to militiamen and terrorists who spread fear and death everywhere,'' said <PERSON> Fawaz </PERSON>, 64, who has been mayor for 20 years. `` Now everyone is moving around here peacefully and freely, thanks to the Irish battalion.'' An Irish sergeant about to be moved out on routine rotation said he was leaving with mixed feelings. `` There are a lot of poor people here who are in great need of our humanitarian work, which is worth risking my life for,'' said the sergeant who could not allow his name to be used because of standing regulations. An Irish major at headquarters in <LOCATION> Tebnin </LOCATION> said it `` would be a fire zone without us.'' `` When the Irish battalion first came here, the villagers did not have any electricity and had shortages of water,'' he said, `` But we helped them, and now they are confident in their future because of us.'' The Irish battalion has lost 30 soldiers in attacks by various groups over the years. Investigations were still under way to determine who planted the landmine that exploded under a <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> jeep near <LOCATION> Haddatha </LOCATION> on March 21 and killed the three soldiers, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said. The other two recent attacks were carried out by the Israeli-backed <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- SLA -RRB- militia, which controls a narrow strip of Lebanese territory that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> refers to as its `` security zone.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> maintained the zone when it pulled out the bulk of its invading army from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in the summer of 1985, ending a three-year occupation. The terrain, which extends from the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> in the west to the slopes of snow-peaked <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hermon </LOCATION> in the east, serves as a buffer against cross-border infiltrations by Palestinian guerrillas into northern Israeli settlements. Col. <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON> blamed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> attacks on the Irish battalion. He said such hostilities were due to `` the lack of control from the Israeli army command on the <ORGANIZATION> SLA </ORGANIZATION> militiamen.'' <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fawaz </PERSON>, the son of <LOCATION> Tebnin </LOCATION>'s mayor who owns a gift shop near the Irish battalion headquarters, said, `` <LOCATION> Tebnin </LOCATION> residents notify the Irish command about the possibility of any attack on them that we come to know of.'' The younger <PERSON> Fawaz </PERSON> stressed the economic value that the Irish battalion represents to the area. The troops spend at least $ 500,000 annually on souvenirs and goods they buy duty-free from local stores.

 On April 26, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> will convene for a 60-minute hearing on one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most polarizing issues _ abortion. The debate centers on a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law that restricts abortion and declares that human life begins at conception. The two sides in this <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case represent in microcosm the deeply divided sentiments felt across the country. In two stories, part of an intermittent series on abortion issues, The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> profiles key players in this <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case: the pro-choice advocates and the clinic at the heart of the dispute, and the leader of the anti-abortion forces, a man committed to a fight he sees as good vs. evil.

 <PERSON> B.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Isaacson-Jones </PERSON> has days when she knows that dressing in red will provoke the ugly taunts again. `` <PERSON> B.J. </PERSON>, you're wearing red,'' scream the protesters sometimes gathered outside her office. `` Does that match the blood on your hands?'' The taunts have taken a toll on the director of <ORGANIZATION> Reproductive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, the abortion clinic at the heart of an emotional and explosive debate before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's not unusual for me to close my office door and sob,'' she said. `` I'm proud of the way I live my life. It's hard when you're standing close to people and you can feel the hatred I do n't hate people.'' The intense feelings are likely to grow even stronger as April 26 draws nearer, the day the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> hears arguments over a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> statute that could chip away or overturn the 1973 ruling that legalized abortion. For anti-abortion advocates who've been waiting and working for this day for 16 years, it's a time of great hope. But for pro-choice supporters, just as eager to prevent this moment, it's a time of high anxiety. `` We are gravely concerned about this case,'' said <PERSON> Isaacson-Jones </PERSON>, whose non-profit clinic is the largest in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. `` What's at stake here is women's lives. It's that complicated and that simple.'' Missouri's pro-choice forces have grown from a small underground movement to a group of determined activists challenging a state whose Legislature has passed anti-abortion measures by 5-1 majorities. Two veteran advocates are key players in this case: <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Susman </PERSON>, a lawyer who will be arguing his fifth <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> abortion case before the high court, and <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Widdicombe </PERSON>, a former nurse at a Roman Catholic hospital and the founder of the clinic. Together, with <PERSON> Isaacson-Jones </PERSON>, they've shared not only their convictions, but also death threats, pickets at home or outside the clinic, obscene phone calls and harassment of their families. <PERSON> Susman </PERSON>, who represents the clinic, says someone once placed a bogus newspaper ad saying his house was for sale. A picket sued him for $ 250,000, claiming he'd assaulted her as he escorted a woman into another clinic where protesters were gathered. A jury cleared him. Reproductive Health is only one of seven plaintiffs _ Planned Parenthood of <LOCATION> Greater </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> is another _ but it has been the target of some of the most vicious attacks. Once, protesters stood on clinic desks and jumped through a reception window. In 1986, five gallons of gas were poured under the waiting room door and ignited. The blaze caused more than $ 100,000 damage. No one was arrested. `` This is a very violent movement,'' said <PERSON> Widdicombe </PERSON>, now a consultant for <ORGANIZATION> Voters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> For </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Choice </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` I think it has become a rapidly escalating war in the last 10 years.'' Abortion opponents in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, however, insist they repudiate violence and say verbal harassment is the wrong way to sway hearts and minds. `` If I have a sincere desire to point out the error of their ways, I'm not going to be able to accomplish that by screaming and hollering at them,'' said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> anti-abortion leader. The name-calling and pickets do prompt soul-searching. `` I stand in the shower the next morning and go over everything that was said,'' said <PERSON> Isaacson-Jones </PERSON>, who started at the clinic as a volunteer. `` I think, could they possibly be right? I go back stronger in my conviction. I will examine that again. I know I shall. `` But what I return to are the faces of the women I see,'' she added. `` I always, always understand the reason why a woman has chosen to terminate her pregnancy. I may not like the reasons she's waited so long ... `` The antis say God's on their side,'' she said. `` I say God's on my side as well. Isaacson-Jones' support of abortion rights stems from her high school days in the'60s when she saw pregnant classmates shunned and forced to drop out of school. `` I realized the incredible impact of one sexual experience on the rest of a woman and her family's life,'' she said. Today, she runs a clinic with 64 staff members, 35 volunteers and two offices. It counsels 15,000 women each year; more than 8,500 choose abortion. The women come from eight states: <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; 30 percent are poor. It's a long way from the late'50s, when <PERSON> Widdicombe </PERSON>, then a nurse, saw women disfigured trying to abort themselves, sometimes with lye. She later worked at a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> hospital, caring for new mothers in the labor and delivery section, then spending her free time arranging legal and illegal abortions _ sometimes as far away as <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` The hospital found that totally incongruent,'' <PERSON> Widdicombe </PERSON> said. She resigned. It was a scary time, too. `` There was a level of paranoia, absolutely,'' <PERSON> Widdicombe </PERSON> said. `` I did think about what it would be like to go to jail.'' <PERSON> Susman </PERSON> provided legal advice at the time. He now represents about 20 abortion clinics nationwide on a part-time basis, estimating reproductive issues account for about 10 percent of his work. In 1973, <PERSON> Widdicombe </PERSON> opened the clinic. Three hundred protesters marched outside. `` I though we'd just provide a clinic and work ourselves out of business,'' she said. `` It was pretty naive. We really felt we would decrease the need for abortion'' with education and research. Pro-choice leaders say they've been far less successful in organizing than their opposition. They also claim abortion foes misrepresent their cause. `` We have allowed this small group to define pro-choice as pro-abortion,'' said <PERSON> Isaacson-Jones </PERSON>. `` Think about the vivid pictures the anti-abortion people -LRB- display -RRB-. Who's going to argue with that? They have signs ... ` Money, Blood, Murder' ... That's not the reality of choice. Unlike her opponents, <PERSON> Isaacson-Jones </PERSON> says she is n't interested in converting anyone. `` I really do n't want to change their minds,'' she said. `` I wish they'd leave us alone and allow us to work in dignity.'' <PERSON> Susman </PERSON> expresses optimism about this case: `` I do not believe the court is prepared to turn back the clock 16 years.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Asiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> will spend about $ 1 billion to buy nine <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> jetliners and take options on seven more because the new airline does n't want to risk its reputation on older planes, an <ORGANIZATION> Asiana </ORGANIZATION> executive said. In a separate announcement Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bahrain </ORGANIZATION> said it will spend $ 1 billion over the next five years to buy six <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 767s and 12 <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION> A-320s. The combined value of the <ORGANIZATION> Asiana </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> orders to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> would be about $ 1.4 billion. S.Y. Park, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Kumho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Asiana </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, said that in addition to wanting new planes, it chose <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> was because the Seattle-based plane builder took the new airline seriously. <ORGANIZATION> Asiana </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, began operations within that country on Dec. 23. It said it will use its new jets to expand to other Asian markets and eventually to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` In the short term, we could have saved a few dollars by buying or leasing older planes,'' <PERSON> Park </PERSON> said. `` However, a new airline has enough problems establishing its market base without the burden of heavy maintenance responsibilities and the uncertainty of whether older planes will perform reliably.'' <PERSON> Asiana </PERSON> ordered five 737-400s and took options for another five. It also signed letters of intent to order two 747-400 jumbo jets and take options for two more, and to convert two previous options for widebody 767-300s to firm orders. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> normally does n't announce letters of intent, said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, but <ORGANIZATION> Asiana </ORGANIZATION> had made it clear it intended to buy the planes. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> described a letter of intent as just short of an order, with the major difference being no money is paid to begin construction. <ORGANIZATION> Asiana </ORGANIZATION> began its Korean service Dec. 23 with six 737-400s leased from <ORGANIZATION> GPA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>. Deliveries of <ORGANIZATION> Asiana </ORGANIZATION>'s new planes will begin in July 1992. Gulf Air spokesman <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Karim </PERSON> said it was ordering its new planes on an optional basis, allowing the airline to drop the order without liability to compensate the manufacturer. Gulf Air is owned by the governments of <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhabi </PERSON>. The announcement came one day after <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s board met in the Qatari capital of <LOCATION> Doha </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Abdel-Karim </PERSON> said the 18 jets will be delivered between 1990 and 1994. Gulf Air is currently spending $ 260 million to lease four <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 767-300s as part of a modernization program. <PERSON> Abdel-Karim </PERSON> said that by June the airline will have nine <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L-1011 </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tri-Stars </ORGANIZATION>, eight <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s and six <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 767-300s. The fleet will increase to 40 to 42 aircraft by 1994, he added. Not counting the Gulf Air planes, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has announced orders for 110 jetliners worth $ 8.7 billion this year.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has recalled more than 340,000 cars and trucks for safety-related and other problems. The company said Monday it was asking owners of 26,000 1988-89 F-Super Duty trucks and truck chassis to return the vehicles because of front-end suspension problems that could cause shaking and loss of steering control. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said a bolt attaching the front axle track bar bracket to the front cross-member may loosen. The company said it was aware of about 120 cases of front-end `` shimmy,'' but no injuries because of it. The company also said 750 of its 1989 <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> cars were being recalled to tighten a bolt in a rear seat-belt attachment. Those cars were assembled between late November and early December last year. In a non-safety-related matter, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said it was asking 302,000 owners if some 1988 <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> <PERSON> Continentals </PERSON>, Mercury Sables and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> Taurus cars and some F-Series trucks and Econoline vans to return their vehicles for alternator inspections. The company said a problem with an epoxy bond could cause electrical system problems. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> also said it would provide coverage for about 12,500 1985-86 Merkur XR4Ti cars with leather interiors. The upholstery may harden, crack or discolor and the seams may fail, the company said. Owners of all vehicles involved in the four announcements will have repairs performed free of charge.

 Burger King has announced it will split its procurement and distribution arm, <PERSON> Distron </PERSON>, into separate entities as part of a previously announced restructuring of the fast-food chain. `` This reorganization is the latest step in our restructuring of the entire Burger King operation to make the company more competitive and more focused on the customer,'' <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Burger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday. Distron will be replaced by Burger King Supply Management and Burger King Distribution Services. The supply management operation will be responsible for buying corporate restaurant food and supplies at the local and national levels. Distribution services will deliver food and supplies to restaurants. British conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> bought Burger King and its parent <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in January after a tough takeover battle. `` Before we acquired <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> and Burger King, our external analysis of <LOCATION> Distron </LOCATION> indicated that it would be advisable to sell the division, because it appeared to hinder the Burger King system,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. `` However, now that we have acquired the company and performed our own in-depth analysis, we have concluded that a reorganized internal procurement and distribution system will be a tremendous asset to Burger King,'' he added. According to the company, the reorganization will allow it to consolidate its buying and maximize purchasing power for a more consistent product. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Highland </PERSON> will serve as president of <ORGANIZATION> Burger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distribution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Formica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says further discussions are expected between a special committee of the board of directors and parties interested in acquiring the laminated products company. However, <PERSON> Formica </PERSON> announced Monday that it rejected a revised $ 243 million takeover offer from a management-led group, one of several offers made for the company in recent months. Formica officials declined to elaborate on the denial of <ORGANIZATION> FM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s bid, voted on by a special committee of the board of directors. According to the $ 18.75-per-share offer, additional financing for the offer would have been provided by an industrial corporation that signed a confidential agreement with <PERSON> Formica </PERSON>. <PERSON> Formica </PERSON>, which makes laminated products used in kitchen countertops and tables, announced two weeks ago that it received a $ 256 million bid, but would not identify the bidder. At that time, <ORGANIZATION> Formica </ORGANIZATION> also said its committee of independent directors instructed <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to begin negotiations with the company. Last fall, <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, businessman, offered $ 20 a share in cash and securities for <PERSON> Formica </PERSON> and was rebuffed. After the management group announced its offer, <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> said he was considering a new bid. It was not known if the $ 256 million bid came from <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> also is continuing discussions with six other interested third parties, but <ORGANIZATION> Formica </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Way </PERSON> would not comment Monday beyond the contents of the news release.

<HEAD>Investment Group To Buy Grand Union Supermarkets For $1.2 Billion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a privately owned Northeast-based supermarket chain, will be acquired by a partnership of investment banks in a deal worth about $ 1.2 billion, the buyers announced. The acquisition would mark the latest big supermarket takeover by Wall Street firms, which are attracted to the business because it is considered largely recession-proof and generates large quantities of cash. Over the past few years, for example, the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> acquired <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 4.2 billion and <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 1.2 billion; and <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> acquired <ORGANIZATION> Supermarkets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 1.8 billion. Under the Grand Union agreement announced Monday, a company formed by <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tabak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hirsch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> will buy all of <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s stock for cash. The total value of the transaction, including debt and preferred stock, is about $ 1.2 billion, the investment firms said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> will provide financing for the deal, which must be reviewed by the government under federal antimonopoly laws. <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an affiliate of <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tabak </ORGANIZATION>, which is a New York-based brokerage and merchant bank, and the management of Grand Union also will have an equity stake in the new company formed by the merger, the statement said. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>, a principal of <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tabak </ORGANIZATION>, will be chairman of the company. <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> also is chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION>, a regional supermarket chain operating mainly in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> with annual sales of $ 3 billion. <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, GU's current chairman and chief executive officer, has elected to retire once the sale of the company is completed. <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has been in the food retailing business for more than 116 years, with annual sales of about $ 2.7 billion. It owns and operates 308 supermarkets in seven Northeastern states and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> under the Grand Union and Big Star trade names. <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has an excellent management team, which is expected to pursue expansion plans.

 <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> should be able to get $ 2.5 billion or more for its giant consumer finance subsidiary that could be used to buy more media and entertainment properties or repurchase stock, analysts say. <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Western stock rose Monday following its weekend disclosure that it plans to sell <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's third-largest consumer finance company, and concentrate on its entertainment and publishing businesses In trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Western rose $ 2.37 -LCB- a share to $ 51.87 -LCB-. Some analysts predicted Chairman <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> would use the huge cash hoard to make acquisitions in the media and entertainment business, but others said he may use the money to accelerate the company's stock repurchase plan that has gobbled up more than 45 million shares since 1983. `` I'm taking the contrarian view here _ I'm not convinced there are attractive assets available at prices they would be willing to pay,'' said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Logsdon </PERSON>, an entertainment industry analyst for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Crowell </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weedon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. He said he expects <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Western could get $ 3 billion to $ 4 billion for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> and use the proceeds for stock repurchases. But <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Neves </PERSON>, who follows <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Western for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said a cash-rich <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Western could be vulnerable to a takeover. `` If they do n't know what they are going to do with the cash, they may have put themselves in play,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the Japanese electronics giant, already has indicated interest in buying a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> entertainment company. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was unavailable Monday to comment on what he planned to do with the proceeds of the sale. The company said in Sunday's announcement that sale proceeds would be used to expand the company's communications operations globally through product development and distribution as well as acquisitions and investments The sale of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> would leave the company with a <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> operation that includes such successful movie titles as `` Beverly Hills Cop,'' `` Fatal Attraction'' and `` ` Crocodile' Dundee'' and a TV library with more than 2,000 episodes of network shows such as `` Family Ties'' and `` Cheers.'' <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> also is a major force in consumer and textbook publishing through its <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Schuster-Prentice Hall division. It also has interests in cable programming, theaters and sports. Some analysts said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> is under no immediate pressure to outline acquisition plans. They said finding a buyer for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> and closing the deal could take months. They said <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Western already is a big enough force in entertainment and the media that its place among the global media giants is assured. But the announcement appeared to stir renewed interest in several media and entertainment companies mentioned recently in takeover speculation. For instance, <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was up $ 1.25 a share to $ 44.75, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> rose $ 1.87 -LCB- to $ 115.37 -LCB-, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> rose $ 4.12 -LCB- to $ 182.62 -LCB- and <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> rose 62 -LCB- cents to $ 56.25. Since he became chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Western in 1983, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> has narrowed the scope of the once far-flung conglomerate. He sold businesses ranging from cigarmaking and chemicals to racetracks while making selective acquisitions in publishing, motion picture houses and cable television. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Noble </PERSON>, a media analyst for <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the proposal to sell the financial unit may help <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> boost the stock price by simply focusing the investment community's view of the company. <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Western earned $ 384.7 million, or $ 3.21 a share, on revenue of $ 5.1 billion in 1988. The consumer finance operations accounted for 46 percent of its operating income and 40 percent of its revenue last year. Entertainment accounted for 31 percent of operating income and 37 percent of revenue, while publishing and information services contributed 23 percent of operating income and revenue.

<TEXT>
 A battle between industry giants over super-absorbent diapers _ and the millions of dollars that come through their sale _ has opened in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court here. In the case, <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> charges that the design of its highly successful super-absorbent Pampers was copied by <ORGANIZATION> Kimberly-Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in developing super-absorbent Huggies. The huge consumer products company wants <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Falcon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawkins </ORGANIZATION> to order <ORGANIZATION> Kimberly-Clark </ORGANIZATION> to stop manufacturing the Huggies and remove them from store shelves. The company also is seeking unspecified monetary damages. The stakes are high, for making disposable diapers is a $ 3.3 billion-a-year business, according to court records. <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, is the industry leader, with 47 percent of the market. Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> Kimberly-Clark </ORGANIZATION> is No. 2 with about 30 percent, industry analysts say. As the trial got under way Monday, attorneys crowded the courtroom while scattered along the jury box were boxes and bags of diapers. The case is expected to last at least three weeks. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerstein </PERSON>, representing <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> P </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; G came up with the idea that made super absorbent diapers possible and took out a patent on the development. The breakthrough, he said, allowed the manufacture of diapers that are generally thinner but more absorbent than regular, more bulky disposables. `` We stayed within the system while <ORGANIZATION> Kimberly-Clark </ORGANIZATION> disregarded and took unfair advantage of the system,'' he told <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> in his opening argument. P & amp; G Researcher <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisman </PERSON> developed a means for combining wood pulp fluff and super absorbent materials in the diaper to allow it to be made thinner, <PERSON> Gerstein </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gerstein </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Kimberly-Clark </ORGANIZATION> copied the idea shortly after the Pampers were test marketed in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, in 1984. The introduction of the new diapers `` turned the diaper world on its ear,'' he said. But attorney <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, representing <ORGANIZATION> Kimberly-Clark </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` This case is about two fiercely competitive companies each trying to improve baby diapers.'' He charged that P & amp; G never had a valid patent because it withheld important test information from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Patent Office. In addition, he said, the system <PERSON> Weisman </PERSON> developed was already covered in a British patent for super-absorbing materials issued to an Italian inventor in 1979. `` In order to have a valid patent, you ca n't be the second person or the 10th person -LRB- to invent something -RRB-. You have to be the first,'' he said. White argued that <ORGANIZATION> Kimberly-Clark </ORGANIZATION> had widespread experience with super-absorbent materials as early as 1977 in the manufacture of tampons and adult diapers. `` <ORGANIZATION> Kimberly-Clark </ORGANIZATION> did n't need lessons from anyone about super absorbent products,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said, noting that `` the only things our scientists learned from the <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION> diapers was how not to make a diaper.'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said the problem with the Pampers when they were introduced was that the super-absorbing material would come off on the skin of babies. It was a problem <ORGANIZATION> Kimberly-Clark </ORGANIZATION> was trying to address in its own labs at the time, he said, adding the company eventually developed a system of putting the material farther away from the babies' skin _ a system for which the company has been awarded a patent. The case is being heard in a non-jury proceeding. It was brought in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> because <ORGANIZATION> Kimberly-Clark </ORGANIZATION> runs a diaper manufacturing plant in <LOCATION> Beech </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>'s $ 10.5 million pay for 1988 is part of `` Detroit's annual executive pigout'' and should be spent on new employees and factories instead, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union says <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> issued its proxy statement Monday, listing compensation for the company's top five executives. Also on Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> announced three new executive vice presidents, including the likely successor to <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>. The proxy statement said <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> was awarded $ 3.3 million in salry, bonuses and other benefits and $ 7.2 million in stock options for 1988. That's far beyond the $ 3.7 million <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> received for 1988 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is expected to issue its proxy statement within a week. At <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, President <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Poling </PERSON> followed <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> in compensation with awards of $ 4.1 million _ $ 2.6 million in salary and supplemental compensation and $ 1.5 million in exercised stock options. The <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> said it was pleased by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s financial success last year, but that its profits should be invested instead in the company and its hourly employees rather than its executives. `` We think they would be far better advised to invest in new facilities and hire more employees rather than squander valuable resources on trying to keep up with the compensation of junk-bond barons,'' <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Yokich </PERSON>, who heads the union's <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement. `` Ford's success in no way justifies the action of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s top executives in taking full advantage of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s annual executive pigout,'' they said. The <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> figured <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>'s hourly wage to be about $ 5,070, compared with the hourly wage of a car assembler at $ 15.73. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> exercised no stock options and received $ 3.7 million. <PERSON> Poling </PERSON> exercised $ 8 million in stock options and received $ 10.9 million in compensation for 1987. Other Ford officers listed in Monday's proxy statement, along with their salaries, supplemental compensation payments and stock options exercised, were: _ <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, executive vice president for <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> automotive operations and named Monday as executive vice president for international automotive operations, $ 3.5 million _ <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, executive vice president and president of the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, $ 3 million _ <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilmour </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>' predecessor in international operations who Monday was appointed executive vice president for corporate staffs, $ 1.7 million Supplemental compensation payments can be deferred into common stock purchase or other programs. Otherwise, the awards will be paid in two lump sums, one last month and the other in January 1990, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's most profitable automaker with earnings of $ 5.3 billion last year, said its board of directors' compensation committee limited the total compensation for eligible officers to $ 250 million. The compensation plan permitted distribution of $ 375.1 million. The difference, $ 125.1 million, will become part of the company's general fund The appointments of <PERSON> Gilmour </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Trotman </PERSON>, who was named <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>' successor, are effective May 1. <PERSON> Gilmour </PERSON> also was named to the office of the chief executive and becomes the odds-on choice to become chairman when <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> reaches <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s mandatory retirement age of 65 in the fall of 1991. That office is shared by <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Poling </PERSON> and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Seneker </PERSON>. At the end of March, Vice Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, grandson of the company's founder, <ORGANIZATION> Henry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, retired from the company and with it, his title was eliminated. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, who was a member of the office of the chief executive, remains a member of the company's board of directors. The promotion of <PERSON> Gilmour </PERSON>, 54, leaves only <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> among the Big Three without an heir apparent to its chairman. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> will be the first of the Big Three's leaders to step aside. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> turns 65 in July 1990 and is expected to step down about then. In November, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> promoted <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenwald </PERSON> to vice chairman, tapping him as the likely successor to Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>, whose contract expires in December 1991. <PERSON> Gilmour </PERSON> joined <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> in 1960 as a financial analyst. During his career with <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> he has been president of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, vice president and controller, vice president for extrnal and personnel affairs, and executive vice president and chief financial officer.

 An <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> supercomputer that will go on sale next year represents the leading edge of a Japanese assault on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> supremacy in the field of high-speed computing. <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> `` are looking at the 1990s as the decade in which they plan to make some serious headway in the supercomputer commercial marketplace,'' said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Canin </PERSON>, a San Francisco-based technology analyst. <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION> said Monday the fastest member of its SX-X series attains peak speeds of more than 20 billion operations per second in one kind of scientific calculation. The <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION>'s peak speed is about 25 percent faster than <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> 3, which is due for shipment to customers around the same time, the July-September period of 1990. Minneapolis-based <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> is likely to hold its lead in supercomputer sales for several years, partly because hundreds of programs are written especially to run on its machines, analysts say. But in the long run, there is a chance that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s excellence in supercomputer hardware could slowly overcome <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s entrenched superiority in software `` This new machine is obviously the one to beat,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindamood </PERSON>, an analyst at the <ORGANIZATION> Gartner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> consulting firm in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` I imagine there will be some fairly severe government wrangling in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as a result of this one.'' <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> stock closed down 12 -LCB- cents to $ 53.87 -LCB- a share in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading Monday, reflecting investors' lack of concern about the short-term effects of the <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION> announcement on the company. Supercomputers are considered crucial to national security because they are heavily used for designing nuclear weapons. They also are used for such tasks as scientific research, oil exploration and weather forecasting. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> limited sales of U.S.-made supercomputers in its home market in the early and mid-1980s while its own companies developed competitive machines. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has strongly discouraged federal agencies and universities that receive government grants from buying Japanese-made supercomputers. <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION> has only one installed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, at the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consortium </ORGANIZATION>. It is common for supercomputer makers to leapfrog one another with new models, but <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION>'s forthcoming models are unusually threatening in two respects: _ <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION>'s fastest machine achieves its speed with four processors, while <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION>'s requires 16 If <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION> learns how to hook together more processors it could extend its lead dramatically. _ For the first time, <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION> is using a base layer of software that is already familiar to potential American customers, Unix That could entice customers who have shied away from <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION> until now because of its unfamiliar operating system. <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> is the world's largest supercomputer maker, although <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> leads in the number of machines installed when mainframe computers rigged for supercomputing work are included. <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON> said the company takes all its competitors seriously, but added, `` We still seem to offer the most effective solution to the user.'' He said peak speed comparisons are misleading because what counts is how fast a computer will run a particular customer's jobs. `` Every time the Japanese come out with a new machine people start saying the Japanese are going to eat our lunch. Today we still have about two-thirds of the worldwide market,'' <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION> has one undisputed advantage: It is the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer that sells on the open market, and can make its own customized, high-speed logic chips. Cray relies on <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> for the central logic chips in its Cray Y-MP line. The central logic chips for its <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> 3 line will come from a small <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company, <ORGANIZATION> GigaBit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Newbury </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. Possibly the greatest threat to <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> is that American customers will buy a few Japanese machines because of their sheer speed and then develop sophisticated software to run on them. `` If the Japanese software begins to approach the quality of what you can get on a Cray, then the competition begins to get very severe,'' <PERSON> Lindamood </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION>'s machines will be sold through <ORGANIZATION> HNSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supercomputers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, a marketing company jointly owned by <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Its president, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Berrett </PERSON>, said the company would like a chance at the government market but failing that will sell to commercial customers, including `` multinationals that are not singularly concerned with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, not <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION>, is the company most feared by the Japanese supercomputer makers. While <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> never has made a pure supercomputer, the world's largest computer company is researching the area intensively and is backing <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>, who left <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> last year to start a company called <ORGANIZATION> Supercomputer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

<DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After the 1964 Good Friday earthquake sent a flood of water to wash away its homes and heart, <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> turned its back on the sea. Mindful of the water's treachery that killed 33 of its neighbors, the city relocated three miles inland behind a protective hump of hills. Its fishing fleet destroyed, its civic consciousness turned inland to the road to <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> and the promise that the trans-Alaska oil pipeline would pump new life into the community. A half-dozen inlets and mountain ridges to the east, the city of <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON> suffered far less. The quake did milder damage, shaking down the Million Dollar Bridge, a railroad trestle being converted to carry highway traffic. The loss ended attempts to link the fishing village to the land. That was just fine for many <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON> residents who believe their collective soul is tied to the blue waters of <LOCATION> Orca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inlet </LOCATION> and the rich herring and salmon schools in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. Twenty-five Good Fridays later the Exxon Valdez ran aground and ripped its hull on <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION>, a hardluck spot close to the epicenter of the 1964 earthquake. The resulting spill of 10.1 million gallons of oil has had a very different impact on the two cities. <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> has been the focus of world concern about the oil spill, receiving full-page newspaper apologies from <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>. It's become a boom town, its hotels and restaurants crowded with oil people, military and media. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> has rented an office building and will be a presence for the years the cleanup will take, pumping money into the local economy. `` This means millions for us,'' said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Buccini </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> cabbie who says his payday is triple that of pre-spill days. `` This town is going to grow.'' But <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON>, which fought against the trans-Alaska pipeline and the tankers it brought to Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, is in shock. An anticipated $ 12 million herring harvest has been canceled and favorite fishing grounds are cesspools. <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON> got no official apology and little money from <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're devastated,'' said <PERSON> Linden </PERSON> <PERSON> Colour </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Toole </PERSON>, who has handled an emergency hotline since the oil spill. `` People are scared and hurt. They're afraid the world has forgotten about us.'' In normal times, <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON> would be a busy place. Its 1,200-boat marina would be crowded with gill netters, seiners and support ships. The canneries would be going and the half dozen bars on First Street would be bustling. There'd be money in everyone's pocket after the long winter's hibernation But instead the town is quiet. The bars are empty and flags fly at half mast. The marina is half filled; many of the boats are in the sound warring with the oil slick. `` No fishing, no business. No business, no economy. No economy, no <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Brucklin </PERSON>, who owns a bar, laundry, motel and warehouse. Many people attend meeting after meeting, worrying at the future while trying to deal with working on the cleanup for <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>. `` The problem with the fishermen is we're used to going out and doing our own work,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> McCune </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Cordova </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fishermen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>. `` Now we have to take <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> jobs and sit here and wonder what's going to happen to the salmon fishery.'' The adults are n't the only ones hurting. <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON>'s children, use to otters and killer whales in the inlet and bald eagles in the sky, have been traumatized by the spill's carnage. <PERSON> Linden </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Toole </PERSON> told of her 3-year-old son seeing a box of dead, oiled birds brought in by a fisherman. `` He kept saying, ` I want to go ` safe' the birds. I want to go ` safe' the birds,''' she said. Whatever happens now, the future of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> is assured by the 800-mile oil pipeline that fills tankers like the Exxon Valdez. Tax revenue from it provides 92 percent of the city's $ 31 million budget, a budget 10 times that of <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON>. The fishermen of <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON> opposed the pipeline. Some of the `` old-towners,'' the pre-earthquake <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> residents, share <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON>'s concerns. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, whose family has fished for four generations, fears the effects of the spill and is frustrated by the attitude of some fellow townspeople. `` What I hear is, ` nature will take care of it,''' said Day. `` I think she probably will, but it will take 30 years.''

<TEXT>
 If you go by the numbers, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mergers and acquisitions fell sharply in the first quarter of 1989 compared with the frenzy of last year, but experts say the figures are misleading and the outlook for more takeovers is good. `` I do n't see this as anything but a fluctuation,'' said <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowenstein </PERSON>, professor of corporate finance at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> `` Nothing fundamental has changed.'' The numbers _ at least on the surface _ indicate merger activity slowed from January through March. Mergers and corporate transactions announced during the first quarter fell to 340 from 410 in the same period of 1988, according to statistics compiled by <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, research firm. The transactions include include recapitalizations and stock buybacks. The dollar value of the deals also plunged, to $ 74.36 billion in the latest quarter from $ 137.17 billion a year earlier, <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> said. But the people who follow merger activity attach little significance to the figures. `` It's much too short a period from which to draw any conclusions,'' said <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, a partner in the law firm <ORGANIZATION> Skadden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Slate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meagher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flom </ORGANIZATION>, which has a large practice in mergers and acquisitions. `` I do n't think quarter to quarter statistics mean a lot,'' <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Margotta </PERSON>, an assistant professor at <ORGANIZATION> Northeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>, agreed, saying, `` It's not significant enough.'' `` It's simply cyclical activity,'' <PERSON> Margotta </PERSON> said. `` Mergers have gone through cycles _ there are lows and there are peaks.'' Furthermore, there's no reason for merger activity to fall off, the professor said. `` The basic forces driving the market are still there,'' <PERSON> Lowenstein </PERSON> said. Recent developments support his statement. <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced this weekend it was in the market for acquisitions, and <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> also says it is looking for companies to buy. Securities Data reported the number of acquisitions declined as `` the investment banking industry regrouped in the wake of the landmark deals of the previous year.'' The company referred to the record $ 24.53 billion buyout of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the $ 12.9 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> and other big deals. <PERSON> Lowenstein </PERSON> acknowledged that `` the system was absorbing <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>,'' but said that should not have affected overall activity. Interest rates moved higher during the first quarter, but <PERSON> Lowenstein </PERSON> also dismissed that as a possible factor. `` That has not chilled mergers in the past,'' he said, noting that when interest rates soared in the early 1980s, `` mergers went along at a splendid clip.'' Merger activity hit an all-time high in 1988, with <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> reporting 2,994 transactions totaling $ 365.09 billion. Many analysts said last year that acquirers were moving up their deals to take advantage of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's relatively lenient attitude toward mergers. <PERSON> Lowenstein </PERSON> discounted that theory as a factor in the first-quarter drop-off. `` That would have accounted for some deals that had antitrust implications ... but you're talking about such a high level of activity,'' he said. The Securities Data report also noted a downturn in foreign merger activity in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with the number of first-quarter acquisitions valued at $ 100 million and more falling to 27 from 30. The dollar value of the deals fell to $ 10.86 billion from $ 28.01 billion. But, said <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, a specialist in foreign mergers, `` I really do n't think it tells you much of anything.'' `` The fundamentals remain the same,'' <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> said. `` As long as the dollar remains at its relatively low value ... <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assets continue to be attractive.'' Securities Data said the number of big <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> acquisitions by Japanese concerns also slipped during the first three months of the year, but <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> again did not see any trend. `` The Japanese have enormous liquidity,'' and they and other foreign acquirers remain interested in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> properties, he said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s key index rebounded sharply today while the dollar inched up against the Japanese yen after remarks by Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> about his links to a stock scandal reassured Japanese investors, dealers said. The dollar closed at 132.62 yen, up 0.09 yen from the previous day's 132.53-yen finish. It opened at 132.87 yen and ranged between 132.60 yen and 132.89 yen. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which fell 186.03 points on Monday, shot up today by 250.56 points, or 0.76 percent, closing at 33,249.58. `` Early morning trading started amid a cautious mood concerning what Prime Minister <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> was going to say before <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Kenji </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishizuka </PERSON> with <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` But the index started to rise as participants discovered <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said nothing worse than what had already been disclosed,'' he added. Volume traded on the first section in the first hour was only 200 million shares, but activity quickened later, and the full day's estimated volume was 1.1 billion shares, <PERSON> Ishizuka </PERSON> said. Addressing Parliament Tuesday morning, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said he had received 130 million yen -LRB- about $ 1 million -RRB- in donations from <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the firm at the heart of a major stock-profiteering and bribery scandal. But he denied taking bribes and continued to reject opposition calls for his resignation. Investors were more or less reassured as <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said nothing new, while agreeing to give a parliamentary committee records of donations and stock profits he and his office have received, <PERSON> Ishizuka </PERSON> said.

In currency dealings, there was some yen buying as exchange market participants also were reassured by <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s remarks, said a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said the exchange rate was likely to change little in the next few days as the market awaits the release of major indicators for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy later this week.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> told parliament today that he received $ 1 million from the company at the center of a highly damaging bribery scandal, but he rejected opposition demands that he resign. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s statement was a reversal of earlier comments that he had not received money from <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an information and publishing conglomerate. `` I am feeling my political and moral responsibilities very strongly,'' he told parliament's budget committee. `` I think it is important to settle this matter legally and politically as soon as possible.'' A series of recent news reports linking <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> to Recruit had prompted the prime minister to explain his role in the widening scandal. `` I am aware the Recruit scandal is the most serious matter I have ever experienced in the 38 years of my political career,'' he said during the nationally televised committee hearing. `` Political reform is essential to overcome the current situation and restore public trust in politics.'' <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said Recruit and its subsidiaries gave about $ 1 million between 1985 and 1987 to his political organizations in the form of donations and purchases of fund-raising party tickets while he was finance minister and secretary-general of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The prime minister said the money was treated as political donations, not bribes. Asked by opposition lawmaker <PERSON> Kanji </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawasaki </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Socialist Party what his understanding was of Recruit's intention in making such large donations, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> replied: `` I am not in a position of telling the intent of another party's political donations.'' In the scandal, Recruit sold hundreds of thousands of unlisted shares in a real-estate subsidiary to about 160 political, business and government officials at low prices. Buyers of the shares received handsome profits when the stock value soared shortly after being listed on the over-the-counter market. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> has acknowledged that a former aide and relative bought shares for a profit of about $ 190,000. But he denied personal involvement in the transactions. To opposition charges that he had reversed his earlier statements, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said: `` I do not remember the details of my statement, but I probably did not have clear recollections of the matter then.'' In October, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> told <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Diet, or parliament: `` I have never received funds or whatsoever from Recruit.'' The scandal has prompted the opposition to demand that <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> resign and call elections to allow the public to give its verdict on the scandal. Some members of his party also want him to step down. `` Your resignation is the only way to save <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s democracy,'' said <PERSON> Kawasaki </PERSON>. `` You are not entitled to discuss political reforms. Your hand is contaminated with Recruit money.'' Japanese politicians long have relied on substantial donations from corporations, both for campaign expenses and for the kind of gift-giving that has become a custom. Politicians say, for example, they are expected to send gifts for constituents' weddings, funerals and other occasions. Because of widespread gift-giving, links between gifts and favors generally are not clear. But the media long have criticized the close links between business and government. Proposed reforms would require a clearer public accounting of donations. Three people resigned from <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s Cabinet after acknowledging they continued to receive Recruit donations after the scandal broke last summer. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said he did not receive Recruit money after 1987, the year he became prime minister. He declined to answer opposition questions about how he would take responsibility if more allegations linking him to the Recruit were revealed. `` But at this point, I do not anticipate anything of that sort will come out,'' he said. So far, 14 people, including two former vice ministers, have been arrested on bribery and securities law violation charges in the Recruit scandal. The investigation is continuing and several politicians are being questioned by authorities. Opposition parties said they suspect <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s donations from Recruit may violate the law governing political donations. Companies of Recruit's size are only allowed to donate $ 113,636 annually to a politician. Also, if it was substantiated that <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, as the finance minister, provided the firm with favors in return for donations, he will become subject to bribery laws. Public support for <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> in opinion polls has declined to all-time lows. One poll released Monday showed <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s approval rate at just 7.8 percent.

 Stock prices slipped in early trading Tuesday but regained some ground as bargain hunters moved into the market. Dealers said prices initially declined on mounting interest rate fears and concerns over the general health of the British economy. However, some market watchers said a handful of institutions could not resist picking up some selected issues once the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-stock index approached the 2,000-point level. Several market makers also said a strong performance by the British pound kept fears of imminent interest rate hikes at bay. The firmer pound gave the market renewed confidence, one market maker suggested. At midday, the FT-SE index was off 5.5 points, or 0.2 percent, at 2,019.5. Earlier, the index was down more than 23 points. Volume amounted to a modest 322.7 million shares by midday, compared with 257.7 million shares at the same time Monday.

<TEXT>
 In addition to the facts and figures formally found in a firm's annual report, <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> 1988 features fun, in the form of a paper airplane. `` This was one of those wonderful years when we made a lot of money and it seemed to be we made a lot of money by getting back to the basics. ... and we translated that to what we thought was the most basic of all airplanes, the paper airplane,'' said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, executive creative director of <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> advertising agency <ORGANIZATION> GSD </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; M, which designed the report. The booklet, besides reporting on <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>'s record $ 57.95 million in profit, traces the construction of a paper airplane from the first folding of the paper to the final painting to resemble Shamu One, <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>'s `` flying whale'' jet rolled out last year during the airline's promotion of <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> theme parks in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` You think every pre-schooler and first grader in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> will want one?'' asked <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON>. `` Or all the CEOs?'' Besides a picture of Chairman <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelleher </PERSON> throwing a paper airplane, the middle of the report features a four-page foldout picture of Shamu One. On the back page, there's the punch-out version of the unusually painted plane, with assembly instructions and this `` helpful hint:'' `` <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> attaches a paper clip to the nose for longer flights -LRB- Shamu One's, not his -RRB-.'' Even though <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> previously has taken a light approach to its reports, <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> said it was a little difficult this year to sell the idea of a punch-out airplane because, `` once someone punches it out, you have an annual report with holes in the back.'' He said he persuaded <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> that the unusual idea would become enticing. `` Everybody's going to pick it up ... and call up for one.'' `` I think it's a delightful brochure and something that really shows the personality that <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> is,'' <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, a regional airline that employs almost 6,500 people, is based at <LOCATION> Love </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> near downtown <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and operates a distinctive fleet of gold, rust and orange jets.

<HEAD>CFTC Charges 22 Traders in Alleged Bond Scheme</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Twenty-two <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> traders face large fines and possible suspension for their alleged roles in a scheme to pre-arrange trades for <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond futures contracts. The <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said the traders executed a series of transactions with <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, a floor broker on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, between July 10 and 24, 1986, that `` were of the character of ... fictitious sales and that as a result ... all of the traders caused prices to be reported that were not true.'' The six-count complaint disclosed Monday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> also charged <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, who was trading on behalf of customers, with fraud, alleging that his customers suffered losses because he traded with the other 21 traders rather than file the orders competitively. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Lydon </PERSON>, denied the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> charges. `` The trades were executed at prices which were the best attainable by the customers,'' <PERSON> Lydon </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> said a hearing before an administrative law judge would be scheduled. The accused traders face possible penalties ranging from fines of $ 100,000 per violation to revocation or suspension of their licenses and trading privileges. The <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> charges follow disclosures a few months ago that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was winding down a two-year undercover probe of alleged wrongdoing among traders at the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> is pressing on this because of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation,'' one trader named in the complaint told the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. His name was not printed. `` They are trying to use this as a ploy to show <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that it -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- is a necessary agency,'' another trader named in the complaint told the newspaper. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Prout </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, said after the exchange became aware of the investigation in May 1988, it asked the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> for permission to take over the probe, but received no reply.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> today approved legislation to lift the remaining price controls on natural gas, which accounts for one-quarter of the nation's energy supply. Before a voice vote to send the bill to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor, several panel members said the decontrol would help ease the nation's growing dependence on imported energy without raising consumers' heating `` I think gas prices are going to fall'' in the short run if the legislation is enacted, said Rep. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauzin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>. Prospects for full congressional approval appeared better than at any time in this decade. Worries about price rises had blocked attempts to end the controls. Industry officials and analysts say the legislation could result in slight declines in consumer prices, but any immediate effect is likely to be small because most of the controlled gas already sells at prices below the federally set ceilings. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> measure is strongly supported by all segments of the natural gas industry and by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, which views price decontrol as a way of promoting natural gas as a cleaner-burning alternative to oil. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has expressed concern at the country's growing reliance on imported oil. Some consumer groups, however, say ending limits on how much producers may charge on about one-third of the nation's gas supply will help the industry without tackling problems of greater concern to the 48 million households that use gas. `` Simple natural gas decontrol can do no good for the residential ratepayer,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, research director for the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. `` It probably wo n't do much harm, but there are a lot of other things that could be done'' to protect consumers from the effects of rules changes. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s group and other consumer advocates say that while market forces are keeping natural gas prices low, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should be focusing more attention on supply issues. One such problem, called `` take-or-pay,'' is forcing consumers to help pay off long-term supply contracts taken by pipelines in the late 1970s when, unlike today, supplies were tight and prices were rising. The average price for residential users in 1987, the latest year for which official government estimates are available, was $ 5.56 per thousand cubic feet, down from a peak of $ 6.12 in 1985. In 1979 the average price was $ 2.98 per thousand cubic feet. The price decontrol bill was introduced by Rep. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, D-Ind., and co-sponsored by 22 of the 23 members of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that approved it last week No action has been taken yet on a similar bill in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The House billcalls for price decontrol to be completed by Jan. 1, 1993. In the interim, price controls would be lifted from gas not subject to a contract on the date of the legislation's enactment as well as certain other gas Sharp in past years had opposed lifting price controls on gas, as had Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, who once said decontrol would occur `` over my dead body,'' but who now supports the Sharp bill The switch in their views is an acknowledgement of changes in the industry's structure since gas deregulation was started by the 1978 Natural Gas Policy Act. That measure removed price limits on certain kinds of gas while also establishing two dozen categories of gas, each with a federally set ceiling price. The collapse of crude oil prices in 1986, coupled with the effects of other market and regulatory changes, led to falling gas prices, excess supplies and greatly increased competition _ both within the industry and with other fuels. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, which had accelerated the decontrol of oil prices as one of its first official acts in 1981, never came close to winning congressional support for gas decontrol. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has vowed to lobby hard on the issue. `` You can be assured it is a major issue with the president himself,'' Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel last month. `` We will support it and support it in a major way.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday it will sell 194,000 acres of timberlands in western <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Crown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> for about $ 230 million. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> first announced plans to sell its northwest timberlands in 1983, and the agreement with Crown represents all but about 16,000 acres of the land to be sold. `` As we indicated in 1983, our northwest timberlands are best suited for producing lumber and building materials products which are not strategic directions for <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> chairman <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lippincott </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Gain On Report Of Declining Crop Status</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Wheat futures prices moved moderately higher today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> on signs of a deteriorating winter wheat crop. Corn and soybean futures were narrowly mixed. In its weekly report on crop conditions, released Monday after the markets closed, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> found a net decline in the condition of the winter wheat crop during the week ended Sunday. The finding was somewhat surprising since a recent increase in precipitation in some key wheat-growing areas had led many traders to expect an overall improvement in the crop. Corn futures prices were slightly lower in early trading, due in part to slack export demand. Slow foreign demand also limited early gains in the soybean market, but higher cash prices and strengthening chart signals provided a generally bullish tone. Cautious trading was expected ahead of the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s monthly grain supply-and-demand report, which was due out after the close today. In early trading, wheat was 1 cent to 5 -RCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in May at $ 3.97 -LCB- a bushel; corn was \ cent lower to \ cent higher with May at $ 2.66 \ a bushel; oats were unchanged to -RCB- cent lower with May at $ 1.86 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 1 cent higher with May at $ 7.20 a bushel Livestock futures were mixed while pork bellies were slightly lower in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .17 cent to .47 cent lower with April at 77.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .03 cent to .23 cent higher with April at 77.30 cents a pound; hogs were .07 cent lower to .25 cent higher with April at 39.80 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .17 cent to .30 cent lower with May at 33.90 cents a pound. Cattle futures settled mostly lower on Monday while pork futures were mixed.

 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel today amended President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s savings and loan bailout plan to ensure that companies which bought failed S & amp; Ls with federal aid last year do not suffer any losses if the assistance is cut off But it rejected an effort by liberal Democrats to make both S & amp; Ls and commercial banks reflect on their books the market value of real estate and <ORGANIZATION> Third </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> loans whose value has declined substantially because borrowers are not repaying them. With a two-month honeymoon disintegrating into a kitchen squabble over who takes out the trash and whose friends get invited to supper, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s financial institutions subcommittee began tackling the most controversial issues in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s $ 90 billion bailout proposal On a 31-14 vote, the panel rejected an amendment by Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, D-Mass., to make financial institutions list loans as assets only at the level for which they could be sold to others, rather than their original value when issued `` There's no reason why banks and thrifts can not be held to the discipline of the market ... and not hold on their books loans at values which are greatly in excess of what they're worth,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` That's why we are in the trouble that we are today.'' Much of the magnitude of the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L bailout has been blamed on congressionally approved accounting practices that allowed thrifts to effectively hide the deterioration of souring loans in their portfolios from regulators. `` We keep hearing about the need for certainty and stability,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Vento </PERSON>, D-Minn. `` This would formalize that process If you want to get tough, this certainly gets tough.'' Critics, however, contended that such a radical change in financial accounting practices might hurt both banks and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls dramatically. `` If we were in a new world and starting from scratch, it would be appropriate,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>. The panel approved on a 35-7 vote a measure by Rep. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON>, D-Ga., that would protect holding companies who bought ill <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls last year with the promise of government aid from having to absorb the costs if those insitutions fail because the assistance is cut off <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> said the measure was aimed at preventing other S & amp; Ls under a holding company's umbrella from also failing because of a government failure to live up to the aid agreements. But <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, complained that the amendment would create a large loophole for holding companies to skirt any liability if the once-failed thrifts go under again. The panel had yet to tackle the much tougher capital standards that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and bankers want to place on <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls and an off-budget financing scheme that has drawn the opposition of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill. To discourage risky loans blamed for much of the current crisis, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would require S & amp; L owners to put up 6 percent capital _ or $ 6 of their own money for every $ 100 they lend _ by June 1991 Those who do n't could not make additional loans with federally insured deposits. But the subcommittee's chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, D-Ill., and <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> have an amendment that would require S & amp; Ls to effectively have only 1.5 percent `` tangible'' capital in relation to total outstanding loans Many S & amp; Ls already fail to meet the current 3 percent capital requirement. Many others meet the requirement only because of widely criticized but federally approved accounting practices, which allow them to count `` good will'' from gestures such as taking over even weaker institutions in the past at the government's behest. A subcommittee aide, asking that his name not be used, said the capital alternative proposed by <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Barnard </LOCATION> is tougher in some ways than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s standard because it narrows the range of acceptable accounting practices. But he also acknowledged it would be much easier for <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls to meet the 1.5 percent target. The issue is considered critical for 300 to 400 marginally solvent S & amp; Ls, and industry officials have said as many as one-half of the nation's 3,000 savings institutions could have trouble meeting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposed standards. Banks already are subject to the 6 percent capital requirement, and they strongly endorse making <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls meet the same standard. They also back provisions in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s bill that would end prohibitions against bank ownership of thrift institutions. But even Republicans on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> have joined in the chorus criticizing the latter, predicting it will create a `` feeding frenzy'' of banks preying upon S & amp; Ls.

<HEAD>Budget Writers Look at Military, Domestic Spending</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 7 grafs new on today's meetings; picks up 5th graf pvs,
The revenues</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 White House and congressional budget writers, with deadlines slipping away, pushed today to finish their talks on a compromise spending and tax package for next year. `` We're hoping to come to an agreement but we have n't made it,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, the senior <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, as he entered today's meeting. `` When we get one issue resolved, we run into another,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> counterpart, who said he was still optimistic. The bargainers have been meeting behind closed doors for more than a month in search of a compromise plan for reducing the federal deficit to $ 100 billion next year, as required by the Gramm-Rudman law. Several of the group's own, informal deadlines for actions have passed. With some more significant ones looming, including <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' April 15 deadline for passing a budget resolution, the negotiators were pressing to finish today. A budget pact would be formally announced at a White House meeting. But without agreement today that was unlikely until next week because President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is leaving town. Based on latest estimates and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s $ 1.16 trillion spending plan, about $ 28 billion in deficit reduction is required. The group has agreed that about half would come from spending restraints and half from raising revenues. The revenues include roughly $ 3.4 billion from selling government assets, $ 5.2 billion from raising various fees for government services and some $ 5.6 billion would be in unspecified new taxes _ but presumably none that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would concede violate his campaign promise for no new taxes. More than $ 7 billion in savings would be made by restraining entitlement programs _ those requiring direct benefit payments to individuals _ including more than $ 2.5 billion trimmed from the expected growth in Medicare costs. Monday's session was dedicated to deciding generally where cuts in non-entitlement government programs would be made, at the Pentagon and at domestic agencies, according to participants who spoke on the condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed that military spending be allowed to grow with inflation, while domestic programs _ other than his own initiatives _ would be frozen at the previous year's levels. Democrats in the talks have proposed trimming back defense growth so that more domestic demands can be met. The bargainers traded offers Monday toward a possible compromise on those and on the small but also politically sensitive foreign aid budget. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has personally contacted at least one lawmaker to lobby against cuts in foreign aid _ a program now administered by his old friend, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who appeared before the negotiators early in the talks. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has a self-imposed April 15 deadline for producing a budget resolution and even if agreement is reached quickly, that deadline will be missed by weeks. Even if the negotiators complete their task this week, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> budget committees must draft more detailed spending plans for each chamber to consider. Then, the two chambers would need to approve a single, compromise plan. The budget, which does not require the president's signature, serves as the guide for annual spending bills and tax legislation for the new fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. If <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president do n't by then bring down the deficit to within $ 10 billion of the $ 100 billion goal, the administration is required under the Gramm-Rudman law to order across-the-board spending cuts to make up the difference.

 The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> could drop a lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> over an allegedly defective nuclear power plant if the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company helps provide alternate power, an official said Tuesday. The government of President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> claims the 620-megawatt plant rests on an earthquake fault and has structural defects. `` Of course we are seeking recovery of damages, but damages ... can be paid in services and facilities,'' Justice Secretary <PERSON> Sedfrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON> said in a television interview. The $ 2.3 billion plant on the <LOCATION> Bataan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, 60 miles west of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, was completed in 1985 several months before President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was driven into exile. The plant was never started. The Aquino government sued <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION>, its subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Projects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and contractors <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Roe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, last December. The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> government also accused <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> of bribing <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to win the contract to build the plant. The suit is intended to cancel the contract and recover the money spent on the plant. It also seeks unspecified damages. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> has denied the bribery charges and claims the plant is safe. <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON> said an out-of-court settlement was `` not out of the picture.'' `` Our concern now is to develop alternate sources of energy,'' he said. `` If that can be met, the money aspect can be minimized. What is important is that we get something for the same value which would help us solve our power needs.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> source said the remarks were hypothetical. Philippine and <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> officials held lengthy negotiations before the decision to file the suit. <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON> was interviewed after <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laurel </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s estranged vice president, called on the administration to operate the plant because of the country's power shortage <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said they did not understand <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION>'s position because the vice president voted with the cabinet in 1986 to close the plant Laurel quit as foreign secretary in 1987 and joined the political opposition last year. `` According to our lawyers, we have sufficient evidence in the matter of proving that we got a raw deal from <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION>,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said Monday. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pugliese </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> executive vice president, said in a statement released in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> that the company was willing `` to explore how we can help bring the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> nuclear power plant into service.'' `` We are confident we built a safe plant,'' he said. `` Prior to its mothballing by the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> government, it had passed every official inspection of its readiness to load, fuel and begin startup testing.'' In <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, attorneys for the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Debevoise </PERSON> to have the case heard in federal court. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> asked the judge to send the case to arbitration before the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>' attorney <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Augenblick </PERSON> said a contract clause prescribing arbitration of disputes is invalid because the state-run <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was forced to sign the agreement.

<HEAD>Coffee Export Quota Cut to Shore Up Falling Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> cut its global export quota by 351,000 bags Tuesday to shore up falling prices. The cut in the October 1988-September 1989 quota was triggered automatically by a fall in the average coffee price below $ 1.15 a pound. One bag equals 132 pounds. The coffee organization's 15-day composite indicator for Monday, calculated on Tuesday, dropped to $ 1.1498 from $ 1.1523 on Friday. The organization, made up of coffee producer and consumer nations, has set a target price for coffee of $ 1.20 - $ 1.40 In February, it twice cut the global export quota when the average price fell below $ 1.20 a pound. The three cuts affect only the quotas of countries producing the poorer grade robusta beans, principally the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. The organization wants to boost supplies of the prized arabica beans grown throughout <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Only if the price of arabica falls from its current level of $ 1.40 a pound to under $ 1.30 will arabica producers face a reduction in their export quotas.

 Weather-damage fears drove wheat futures prices to a moderately higher close Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Other grain and soybean futures finished narrowly mixed. The gain in wheat prices was partly a reaction to the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s weekly report issued after the close Monday showing a net decline in the condition of the winter wheat crop for the week ending Sunday. Dry conditions in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> were cited for the deterioration, and the cold weather of the past three days added to traders' crop-damage fears. `` The weather's a little nippy, to put it mildly, in some areas, slowing development of wheat by about two weeks,'' said <PERSON> Katharina </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. She said other buying was prompted by perceptions that the steep decline in wheat prices over the past two weeks was not entirely warranted Corn and soybean futures closed mixed in cautious trading ahead of the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s monthly supply-and-demand report. In that report, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> revised upward its estimates for 1988-89 corn and wheat ending stocks but let stand its estimate for 1988-89 soybean ending stocks.

 The stock market rose in fairly quiet trading today with many investors cautious ahead of the barrage of economic data due out this week. The producer price index, which serves as a gauge of inflationary pressures, is scheduled for release on Friday along with reports on merchandise trade and industrial production. Analysts said recession-sensitive stocks like foods and soaps, which have shown steady gains in the last few weeks, continued to do well. A number of other sectors, including high technology, entertainment and toys, also performed surprisingly well despite the low volume, they said. Many analysts in the financial world believe economic growth has begun to slow since the start of the year. The employment report last Friday provided mixed signals about the economy. Although the jobless rate slid to 5 percent, fewer than 100,000 new jobs were created. Market participants are looking to the new data to provide a direction for the economy.

 <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which recently emerged as an unwelcome bidder for the Atlanta-based bank holding company <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, reported Tuesday that its first-quarter profit jumped 8 percent over a year ago. Net income for the three months ended March 31 totaled $ 75.8 million, or 82 cents a share, compared with earnings of $ 70.02 million, or 83 cents per share, in 1988. Chairman <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> McColl </PERSON> attributed the improvement partly to a rise in net interest income and strong loan growth. The results included $ 10.8 million in earnings contributions from <LOCATION> NCNB </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, formerly <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, of which <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> owns a 20 percent stake.

 A defense contractor has agreed to pay $ 1 million in fines and damages for selling the government critical bomb components that employees knew were defective, a prosecutor said Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Allied-Signal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, parent company of <ORGANIZATION> Courter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Boyne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, agreed to the settlement fter a three-year investigation resulting in conviction of seven ex-Courter employees, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Smietanka </PERSON> said. The company, which also is parent company of <ORGANIZATION> Bendix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guidance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, agreed to pay the government $ 1 million to resolve its liability under the False Claims Act for possible fines and damages, <PERSON> Smietanka </PERSON> said in a statement. The payment was received April 4 and the case was closed, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> probe began after <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> employees were reported to have routinely falsified test data to hide instances in which critical aviation components failed to meet quality standards. In a May 1986 court-ordered search of <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> testing records, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> investigators found that about 1,500 defective or substandard sophisticated gyroscopes had been sent from <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, to be placed in <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> laser-guided glide bombs. When the fraud was detected, some suspect gyroscopes already had been assembled into the bombs and sent to <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> depots. <ORGANIZATION> Allied-Signal </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Morristown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, which cooperated in the investigation, recalled all defective components and paid <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> $ 2.4 million related to the recall. Seven ex-Courter employees pleaded guilty to related federal conspiracy and fraud charges. Six of the employees, who cooperated with the government, received a sentence of probation. Former plant manager <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Iadarola </PERSON> was indicted by a grand jury on two felony charges and received a three-year prison sentence, which was suspended.

 The dollar finished firmer against most major currencies except the Japanese yen Tuesday, pushed aloft by favorable market sentiment toward the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. Gold prices edged lower in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading, reversing course after moving up on markets overseas. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid of $ 384.90 for a troy ounce of gold, down from Monday's late bid of $ 385.20. The dollar's increase came despite intervention by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. Dealers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> central bank sold dollars at one point but the dollar ended the day near its highest levels of the session anyway. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrissey </PERSON>, senior trader in the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office, said trading was somewhat subdued, probably because managers of corporate currency portfolios and other dealers are taking a wait-and-see attitude ahead of potentially market-moving government statistics due later this week. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reports on March retail sales Thursday and the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issues the Producer Price Index the following day. `` It really was a fairly quiet day,'' said <PERSON> Morrissey </PERSON>. `` The dollar was fairly well bid and closed near its highs of the day. There were really no factors except market sentiment that pushed it higher.'' The dollar benefited from a weakening in the British pound on news that the largest <LOCATION> U.K. </LOCATION> labor union, the Transport and General Workers, may strike to protest the government's intention to end the system of guaranteed work for longshoremen. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound cost $ 1.6995 late Tuesday, unchanged from Monday. But by the time trading was done for the day in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound had lost ground and was quoted at $ 1.6910 compared to $ 1.6955 late Monday. Earlier, the dollar closed in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> at 132.62 Japanese yen, up from 132.53. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> late Tuesday the dollar traded lower at 132.55 and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> it wound up at 132.705, down from 132.90. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with Monday's late rates, included: 1.88525 West German marks, up from 1.88325; 1.66375 Swiss francs, up from 1.66075; 6.3655 French francs, up from 6.35675; 1,381.375 Italian lire, up from 1,379.45; and, 1.18945 Canadian dollars, unchanged.

<TEXT>
 Gasoline futures surged in hectic trading Tuesday, reflecting continued seasonal demand and concern that a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> refinery fire might sharply curtail production. Prices for unleaded gasoline futures traded on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> had jumped more than 3 cents a gallon at one point Tuesday, before profit-taking helped push the closing price down to a gain of just under 2 cents. Crude prices also rose slightly, while wholesale home heating oil declined. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, an energy analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, attributed the uproar in the gasoline pits to news of a fire at <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s busy <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, refinery. He said traders speculated that gasoline and jet fuel production there could be curtailed by up to 25 percent as a result of the blaze. `` The markets are a bit distrustful of supply capabilities lately anyway,'' said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. Oil prices, particularly gasoline, have gotten a boost in recent weeks from the massive Exxon oil tanker spill off the coast of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Strong seasonal demand and new summer octane regulations that are likely to strain refinery capacity gave the market its initial strength. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>, the May contract for unleaded gasoline jumped 1.71 cents to settle Tuesday at 69 cents a gallon. The contract had risen 2.34 cents on Monday. The May contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, closed 4 cents higher at $ 20.63 a barrel, after gaining 57 cents on Monday. May wholesale heating oil, which rose 1.85 cents Monday, fell 0.22 cent to 53.23 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>Corn Exports Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Corn exports are at their highest level since the early 1980s but domestic use by livestock farmers is down sharply, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report showed Tuesday. The new supply-and-demand report said corn exports in the current marketing year that began last Sept. 1 are expected to total 2.1 billion bushels, up by 100 million bushels from indications a month ago and up 21 percent from 1.73 billion shipped in 1987-88. Exports at that level would be the highest since corn shipments totaled 2.4 billion bushels in 1980-81. About 4 billion bushels of corn are expected to be used as livestock feed this year, down from 4.3 billion forecast in March and well below the record of 4.74 billion bushels consumed a year earlier. According to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> records, that would put feed use at the lowest since 3.82 billion bushels were fed to livestock in 1983-84. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stockpile at the end of the beginning of the new corn marketing year on Sept. 1 was forecast at 1.83 billion bushels, up from the 1.66 billion bushels indicated in March. Last Sept. 1, before the drought-shriveled 1988 corn harvest was added to the supply, the corn carryover was 4.23 billion bushels. With a reduced supply, corn prices shot up from an average of $ 1.94 per bushel in 1987-88 to a projected range of $ 2.45 to $ 2.70 this season. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat carryover on June 1, the beginning of the new wheat marketing year, was indicated at 549 million bushels, up slightly from 534 million forecast last month but far below the 1.26 billion bushels in the inventory last June 1. Wheat exports and domestic use are down, but the main impact has been the reduced 1988 harvest. Wheat prices are expected to average $ 3.65 to $ 3.80 per bushel this season, up from $ 2.57 in 1987-88. The soybean situation reflects a bare-bones level of supply, with the carryover on Sept. 1, the beginning of the 1989-90 marketing year, expected to be about 145 million bushels, compared with 302 million last Sept. 1. Drought reduced last year's production, forcing prices higher. The report forecast soybeans might average $ 7.20 to $ 7.60 per bushel this season, compared with $ 5.88 in 1987-88. Exports and domestic use are both down.

 The stock market rose in light trading Tuesday amid ongoing uncertainty about the direction of the economy. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.71 points to finish the day at 2,311.58.

Stocks opened higher, peaked around midday and then moved sideways for the remainder of the session. Volume remained light, with many institutional players staying on the sidelines to await the slew of economic data scheduled for release later in the week. Retail sales for March are scheduled for release on Thursday, followed on Friday by reports on producer prices, merchandise trade and industrial production.

The judge's order was directed at the merger as it pertained to the assets of certain Swiss subsidiaries of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>.

The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s action brought a quick response from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. `` Today <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had a golden opportunity,'' Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said after the vote. `` But <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats squandered the chance, the first chance in eight years, to raise the minimum wage.'' More amendments were being considered before the legislation faced a final <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote, likely to come Wednesday, but no further significant changes were expected before then. `` We compromised,'' said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, referring to his past proposals to raise the minimum wage even higher. He also noted a number of other changes in the legislation, including expanded exemptions for small businesses, to meet Republican concerns. `` The president's approach is a far superior approach,'' Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, said in his unsuccessful effort to win support for substituting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal for the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> bill. The action seemed to guarantee the first domestic-policy showdown between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, barring a compromise while the bill is before a conference committee that will work out minor differences between the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> versions. Such a deal, however, appears unlikely. `` There is n't going to be a compromise,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. `` It's going to be $ 4.25 an hour and a six-month training wage, period.'' Democrats nonetheless called on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to accept their proposal. `` If there is any one thing that the 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must do it is to increase the minimum wage,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, chastising <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for opposing a $ 4.55 an hour minimum wage while supporting expanded capital gains tax breaks for the wealthy. `` This legislation will be a test of whether we indeed are seeking a kindler, gentler nation,'' said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. Both the defeated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposal and the amended <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> bill contain provisions allowing some workers to be paid a wage below the federal minimum wage. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has insisted that provision extend for six months to all newly hired workers, regardless of prior work experience. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, like the sponsors of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill, balked at that proposal but to win the support of moderate and conservative Democrats agreed on a two-month period during which some employees could be paid 85 percent of the minimum wage. That provision was contained in the amendment, offered by Democratic Sens. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. `` Our training wage proposal is a proper balance of the need to train new workers and the need to set a fair minimum wage,'' said <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>. The Graham-Pryor amendment requires an employee to hold one job for at least 30 days before the two-month training period would expire. The House-passed bill also allows for a two-month training period at a subminimum wage but only if the affected employee had no prior job experience.

 Weather-damage fears and expectations of new export business gave wheat futures prices their strongest boost in more than two weeks Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Other grain and soybean futures finished narrowly mixed ahead of an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> supply-demand report that was issued after the close and interpreted as bullish by market analysts. On other markets, gasoline futures surged while other oil futures were mixed; livestock and meat futures retreated; and precious metals were mixed. Wheat settled 3 cents to 6 -LCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in May at $ 4.01 a bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to -LCB- cent higher with May at $ 2.65 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 1 \ cents to 3 -LCB- cents lower with May at $ 1.83 \ a bushel; soybeans were 2 -LCB- cents lower to 1 -LCB- cents higher with May at $ 7.20 -LCB- a The gain in wheat prices was largely a reaction to Monday's weekly <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> crop-weather report, which showed a net decline in the condition of the winter wheat crop for the week ending Sunday The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said winter wheat was `` mostly fair'' but noted deterioration of the crop in the central <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> due to unusually dry, cold weather. `` The weather's a little nippy, to put it mildly, in some areas, slowing development of wheat by about two weeks,'' said <PERSON> Katharina </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. She said other buying was prompted by perceptions that the 40-cents-a-bushel decline in wheat prices since early March was not entirely warranted Additional buying was spurred by <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s statement Monday that an agricultural trade agreement reached over the weekend would not constrain <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spending to subsidize export sales. Corn and soybean futures closed mixed in cautious trading ahead of the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s monthly supply-and-demand report, in which the government raised its estimates for 1988-89 corn and wheat ending stocks but let stand its estimate for 1988-89 soybean ending stocks. <PERSON> Karlin </PERSON> said the increased estimates were lower than most traders had expected and should lend support to the markets on Wednesday. Unleaded gasoline futures soared on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> following wire-service reports that a fire at <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>'s second-largest <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> refinery could shut down the refinery's main unit for up to two months and reduce the refinery's output by about 25 percent Gasoline prices have recently risen sharply on tight-supply fears linked to the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> oil spill in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> released its weekly petroleum-stocks report after the close, showing a 4.7 million-barrel decline in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gasoline stocks last week, which could lead to more buying on Wednesday. The API said crude oil stocks rose by 451,000 barrels while supplies of petroleum distillates increased by 440,000 barrels. Unleaded gasoline futures settled .44 cent to 1.71 cents higher with May at 69 cents a gallon; West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 23 cents lower to 4 cents higher with May at $ 20.63 a barrel; heating oil was .06 cent to .29 cent lower with May at 53.23 cents a gallon. Live cattle futures fell sharply on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in a late round of selling linked to expectations for a sharp increase in supplies of market-ready cattle beginning next month. Profit-taking pressured pork futures prices. Live cattle settled .35 cent to 1.15 cents lower with April at 77.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .40 cent lower to .10 cent higher with April at 77.17 cents a pound; live hogs were .20 cent lower to .40 cent higher with April at 39.62 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .30 cent to 1 cent lower with May at 33.20 cents a pound. Gold futures drifted lower while silver advanced slightly on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in cautious trading ahead of Friday's economic reports, which include merchandise trade data for February, the producer price index for March, and March capacity-utilization and industrial-production figures Gold settled 20 cents to 40 cents lower with June at $ 389.90 a troy ounce; silver was 1.3 cents higher across the board with May at $ 5.863 a troy ounce.

 <ORGANIZATION> Prime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it will seek a buyer willing to pay more than the $ 20 a share offer by hostile suitor <ORGANIZATION> MAI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Four </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> that values the company at $ 970 million.

More than 2.85 million shares changed hands. <ORGANIZATION> MAI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Four </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Tustin </LOCATION>, Calif.-based computer firm controlled by investor <ORGANIZATION> Bennett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LeBow </ORGANIZATION>, launched its bid five months ago for Prime, which is four times its size. In a statement Tuesday, <PERSON> LeBow </PERSON> said he endorsed Prime's move if it is the company's intent to sell itself to the highest bidder. `` However, if this is another one of Prime's delaying tactics, we intend to vigorously oppose it,'' he said, adding that he would continue to pursue his tender offer for Prime. Prime spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gavaghan </PERSON> said estimates valuing Prime at $ 23 to $ 28 a share are more credible than MAI Basic's offer, especially since Prime acquired <ORGANIZATION> Computervision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in February 1988. He also said Prime's board of directors has not been opposed to a sale `` if it provides the share holders with a good -LRB- price -RRB-.'' Prime Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said in a statement that the MAI Basic offer `` does not reflect the intrinsic value in the company today and the long-term values achievable for all our stockholders.'' Prime said it was delaying its annual meeting to June 14 from May 12 to `` provide for an orderly and effective sale process.''

<HEAD>Judge: Diamond Shamrock Insurer Liable For Agent Orange</HEAD>

 A state judge has ruled that insurance companies do n't have to pay for a $ 25 million dioxin cleanup at the site of a former Diamond Shamrock plant, but must fund payments to <ORGANIZATION> Agent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> victims, insurance company attorneys said Tuesday. The case centers around dioxin produced as a byproduct of herbicides, including Agent Orange, made at a <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> plant between 1951 and 1969 by the old <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alkali </ORGANIZATION> company, a predecessor to <LOCATION> Shamrock </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> has restructured and now is called <ORGANIZATION> Maxus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The company sued more than 100 insurers seeking coverage for the cleanup of the dioxin, which is linked to certain cancers, liver disease and a severe skin rash known as chloracne. In a decision released to lawyers on Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Morristown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, ruled that <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION>'s actions removed it from coverage, said <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON> heard a non-jury trial that began in September. The decision could have wide-ranging effects in other cases in which companies seek to have their insurers handle millions of dollars in chemical and toxic waste cleanups, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>, who represents <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Re-Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. The opinion was to be filed Wednesday morning. Insurance company attorneys provided excerpts from it, but <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> lawyers could not be reached for comment. <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON>, reached at home, confirmed his ruling but declined to discuss it, referring questions to the written opinion. `` Even by the standards of the 1951 to 1969 period, <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION>'s conduct in operating the <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> plant was unacceptably wrong and irresponsible,'' <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON> wrote `` Diamond always put its narrowly perceived economic interest first. It deliberately and persistently cheated on the limited environmental regulations which were in place.'' But <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON> also found that the insurance companies have to pay the bulk of <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 23 million share of a $ 180 million settlement reached in 1984 between makers of Agent Orange used in the Vietnam War and those who sued over its health effects. <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON> interpreted the company's insurance contracts to mean that the insurers would have to bear most of the Agent Orange payments, and established how the payments would be distributed among the carriers, according to <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>. Lawyers for the company could not be reached. They either had gone home for the evening or did not return phone calls. A <ORGANIZATION> Maxus </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, Ginger Shearburn, could not be reached. There was no answer at the company and she did not return a telephone call left on her home answering machine.

<TEXT>
 White House and congressional budget negotiators, driving toward a deficit-reduction deal, said Tuesday that major issues remain and pledged not to let any deadline `` blow up'' the talks. `` When we get one issue resolved, we run into another,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, senior Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have not closed on any of the major ones -LRB- issues -RRB-,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority leader `` You just have to keep plodding on, one step after another.'' Privately, some participants said there was an eagerness to finish so that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and congressional leaders could announce a pact at the White House this week. But no announcement was scheduled by the time the group broke for the night Tuesday, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned to leave <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the weekend early Thursday, But <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said the group was not working against any deadline. `` It's silly to blow up a long negotiation over an artificial deadline,'' he said. The goal of the talks is agreement on the general outlines of a budget to bring the fiscal 1990 deficit down to $ 100 billion as mandated by the Gramm-Rudman law. The talks have dragged on far longer than expected and are now pressing against a Saturday deadline for passing a budget resolution. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed his $ 1.16 trillion budget in February, estimating that about $ 27 billion needed to be slashed from current government programs _ or revenues increased _ to meet the Gramm-Rudman goal. The negotiating team has been working on a $ 28 billion plan, with about half the deficit savings coming from new revenues and half from spending restraint. On the spending side, more than $ 7 billion in savings would be made by restraining entitlement programs _ those requiring direct benefit payments to individuals. More than $ 2.5 billion of that would be from holding back some of the expected growth in Medicare spending. They tentatively agreed last week that the revenues would include roughly $ 3.4 billion from selling government assets, $ 5.2 billion from raising various fees for government services and $ 5.6 billion from unspecified taxes. However, the revenue mix has been changing this week as the group has consulted the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the congressional committees responsible for putting the agreement into legislation. Less money would be raised with new fees, and more through asset sales, sources said. Although the tax figure is about the same as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed in his budget, the president's plan relied heavily on his proposal to cut the tax rate on capital gains. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> contends a lower capital gains rate would actually increase government revenues by $ 4.8 billion next year. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> on Tuesday denied <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was abandoning his support of capital gains tax reduction, but it was subject to negotiation. `` He will believe in the capital gains tax cut forever and ever,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` I'm not making any commitments in terms of the budget deal. The budget deal is up to negotiation. Everything is under discussion.'' Actually, the details of the tax package and specific spending decisions would be left for later. The negotiators have been working to produce a very broad set of guidelines, setting forth total figures for a handful of revenue and spending categories. It would be left for the normal legislative process to produce the steps to enact those totals. Participants in the talks said they were sworn to secrecy about the specifics, because of the sensitivity of the current discussions on possible cuts in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s $ 300 billion defense budget and in domestic programs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed that military spending be allowed to grow with inflation. Democratic negotiators have asked for slower defense growth so that more domestic demands can be met. If the negotiators complete a package, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> budget committees would then draft more detailed spending plans for each chamber to consider. Then, the two chambers would need to approve a single, compromise plan. The budget serves as the guide for annual spending bills and tax legislation for the new fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. If <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president do n't enact legislation to reduce the deficit to within $ 10 billion of the $ 100 billion goal, the administration is required under the Gramm-Rudman law to order across-the-board spending cuts to make up the difference.

 <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and five current and former employees were indicted Tuesday on charges they conspired to defraud the government in building components for the guidance system for the cruise missile and the Harrier jet fighter. The 167-count indictment announced by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> charged that <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> and the five conspired to install install parts of the cruise missile system which failed to meet government specifications. The indictment also alleged that lengthy reliability testing on the cruise missile's Flight Data Transmitter was not performed as required and that three of the defendants supervised false testing and falsification of test results. If convicted on all charges, <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> faces a maximum fine of more than $ 30 million. Each of the individual defendants would face maximum jail sentences of five years on each count and fines ranging from $ 5,000 to $ 250,000. `` Today's indictment is part of our continuing efforts to identify, prosecute and hopefully deter defense procurement fraud,'' <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> said in a statement. He said the indictment was the result of a two-year probe by a multiagency task force. There was no immediate reaction to the indictment from <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>. `` Obviously we have n't seen it, so we ca n't comment,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Waskul </PERSON>, a spokesman at the Century City office. Named in the indictment were <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamron </PERSON>, a resident of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and vice president and general manager of the Precision Products Divsion of <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>. Also named were <PERSON> Leopold </PERSON> <PERSON> Engler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, formerly a vice president with <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonsalves </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Glendora </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, former manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> department of <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hannan </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Glendora </LOCATION>, formerly quality assurance supervisor for <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> of <PERSON> Yorba </PERSON> <PERSON> Linda </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, former chief engineer for <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. With regard to the Harrier jet project, the indictment accused <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>, Gonzalves, <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Hannan </PERSON> of conspiring to defraud the government about the stabilization systems sold by <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> to be installed in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> jet. The indictment accused the defendants of failing to conduct vibration tests at levels required by the contract on sensor assemblies used in the jet, and then falsely certifying they had been properly tested. The Harrier can take off from short fields and can hover, and sophisticated stability controls are critical to its performance and safety. On the cruise missile project, the indictment charges that <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Yamron </PERSON> and <PERSON> Engler </PERSON> knew that the Flight Data Transmitter was required to withstand temperatures as low as -65 degrees, but supplied parts that froze at temperatures of -40 to -50 degrees. Many of the cruise missile's presumed targets are deep within the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, where temperatures can drop to extreme levels. Should the Flight Data Transmitter fail in extreme cold, the weapon could not reach its target. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> produced and shipped approximately 1,175 Flight Data Transmitters between 1981 and 1989 for use in the missile, which have been deployed on B-52 and B-1B bombers. The company produced and shipped 189 sensor assemblies for the Harrier jet between 1982 and 1989. <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> are now evaluating the evidence on the alleged falsifications in order to determine if action must be taken to ensure the reliability of the missiles and the Harrier. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> also is the target of five civil lawsuits by former employees who alleged the company falsified test results and cheated the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on the MX missile project. In addition to well-publicized battles with critics of the MX program, the company faces a congressional investigation of allegations of improper payments to South Korean businessmen in an unsuccessful effort to sell its F-20 Tigershark fighter in that country in 1984. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> is also the main contractor for the B-2 stealth bomber.

 Rough seas that helped stall and break up some of giant oil spill from the Exxon Valdez became calmer Tuesday and winds shifted away from fish-rich <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. `` <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> still seems to be saved,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>, the state of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s cleanup coordinator. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeze </PERSON> said the spill appears to have stalled and is breaking into tar balls. `` That's better than ooey, gooey oil,'' he said. Equipment continued to pour into the area aboard military transports. About 67 tons of material, everything from containment booms to absorbent pads, were scheduled to arrive Tuesday. A huge Soviet oil-skimming vessel, the <PERSON> Vay </PERSON> <PERSON> Dagursky </PERSON>, was expected to arrive Saturday, state officials said. The ship can skim 200,000 gallons an hour and store 2 million gallons of oil on board, according to the officials. But it remains unclear how effective it might be against the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> spill. Despite the favorable weather, a light sheen of oil seeped into the Kenai Fjords National Park at scattered inlets and fjords, Freeze said. With a thickness measured in molecules, the sheen does not threaten serious environmental damage, he said. The operator of the trans-Alaska pipeline said it had complied with a state order for an around-the-clock, 12-person oil spill emergency response crew, and had purchased a supply of oil dispersant. <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has been criticized for disbanding the emergency response team years before the spill, and for not having enough dispersant on hand to combat the 10.1 million gallons of crude that spilled. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said it planned to deploy a flotilla of 30 fishing boats from <PERSON> Seward </PERSON> and six from <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION>, along with the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter <PERSON> Morganthau </PERSON>, to drag small-holed herring and shrimp nets through the leading edge of the slick. Coast Guard Capt. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackett </PERSON> said tests Monday showed the nets break the oil into small globs, which do n't reform. The operation may not begin until Wednesday, <PERSON> Blackett </PERSON> said. Much of the cleanup operation so far has relied on floating containment booms. Cleanup crews ran into trouble when they tried to deploy a more permanent boom at Sawmill Bill, site of a salmon hatchery. Anchors were n't available in adequate numbers, Freeze said, and depth charts that had n't been updated since the 1964 earthquake proved inaccurate. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has been in charge of cleanup operations since President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ordered stepped up federal involvement last week. Monday's rough weather, which saw seas to 15 feet, gale-force wind warnings and small craft advisories, turned calmer Tuesday. Aerial spotter flights resumed, seas reduced to 5 to 7 feet _ still above normal _ and winds shifted from the northwest. That could steer oil to the southeast and away from the coastline and <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION>, the nation's richest fishing port last year. Oil has n't traveled further southwest than <LOCATION> Gore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, about 80 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION>, in four days. `` The weather did get very rough out there,'' said <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Alabaster </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` Under certain conditions these weather factors could be very beneficial.'' Officials hoped for a more accurate assessment of the sea's work when aerial surveys are completed. The spill has killed thousands of birds and animals, and gasoline prices in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have surged in the wake of the disaster. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> warned oil companies against using the spill as an excuse to increase prices. `` If they're doing it, they're making a big mistake,'' he told reporters in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. `` I hope the oil industry is n't foolish enough _ and I do n't think they are, I have n't seen any proof of it _ to think they can take advantage of the situation at <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> to raise prices unnecessarily.'' In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> ordered state officials to investigate the rising oil prices. `` It would be patently unfair if the oil industry took advantage of a tragedy of its own making in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> as an excuse to increase retail gasoline prices,'' said <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. `` That would be the equivalent of picking the pockets of ... consumers.'' At the <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cafe </LOCATION>, fishermen anxiously awaited their fate. Even if the spill turns back this time, <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> may not be in the clear for months until most of the slick is out in the gulf. `` Yeah, I worry about the long-term effects. We all do. I wonder what will happen,'' said <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, who harvests crab, salmon and halibut on his 52-foot boat. About 18,000 barrels of crude have been recovered _ only 8 percent of the 240,000 barrels that spilled March 24 when the tanker ran aground on <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said with additional skimmers about 2,000 barrels were being recovered daily. Reports from state officials and the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> have placed the figure at about 1,000 barrels a day.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' striking unions reached 5-year agreements Monday with <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> that apparently resulted in changes to <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>'s agreement to buy the airline from parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, sources said. After four days of almost continuous bargaining, <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>'s group and the three striking unions, representing the Machinists, pilots and flight attendants, struck their deals at about 6 a.m. Monday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> The parties then flew to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and went directly to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Court for a series of meetings that lasted eight hours. Present for some of the meetings was former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, although his role was not clear. At 7 p.m., <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> emerged from the courthouse and announced the union settlement, calling it `` a historic labor partnership.'' Sources said <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> and the unions apparently made changes to the $ 464 million deal under which the former baseball commissioner would buy Eastern. Unless <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> agrees to the changes, the unions' agreements with <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> can not go forward. A key change demanded by the unions is that the bankruptcy court appoint a special trustee to take over the operation of Eastern from <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> as the airline attempts to emerge from Chapter 11, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in Tuesday's editions. `` We have not yet seen a copy of the agreement. We understand it is very complex and we will study it,'' <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> said late Monday from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. `` We have one more major bridge to cross,'' <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> told reporters, reading a statement he had just scrawled in the courthouse lobby. `` And that's right here in this courthouse. That bridge must be crossed. ... There's no guarantee we will cross it.'' <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> said talks would continue Tuesday in an effort to get Eastern, the nation's seventh-largest airline, back in the air. Eastern has been largely grounded since Machinists struck March 4 and pilots and flight attendants walked out in support. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, which purchased Eastern in 1986, was maintaining that nothing had been accomplished. `` There's no agreement as far as we're concerned,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Zirinsky </PERSON>, an Eastern lawyer. `` There was no meeting of the minds,'' said <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, another Eastern lawyer. <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> declined to give details of his deals with the unions. Union sources said the concessions totalled about $ 210 million. The unions have been wary that proposed tranfers of assets totalling $ 79 million from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> could affect <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s viability. The unions, since before the strike, have been oppoosed to transferring aircraft, routes, airport gates, among other thing. All agreements must be approved by parties to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s bankruptcy proceeding, which include <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s Eastern filed for protection under the bankruptcy laws on March 9. Lawyers for the creditors were present for the whirlwind series of meetings at the courthouse. Among the union participants were <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union; <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavis </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots union; and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s flight attendants union Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON>, who is presiding over the bankruptcy, was nearby and even made popcorn for the negotiators. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, a vice chairman of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> investment company, was in and out of the talks. He declined to identify his role. By the end of the day, the negotiators had reached the point of exhaustion. <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>, who flew to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Friday, returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Saturday and said he had not slept since. Representatives of the unions and examiner <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> had been going non-stop with <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>'s people since Thursday night. Several times, they needed to break away. <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> took representatives of the three striking unions to lunch. At another point, <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> broke away with partner <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Talbot </PERSON> and and went to a restaurant where they talked and watched a college baseball game on television. By dusk, the parties said they were too tired to go on and <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> asked the court's permission to announce the deals with the three unions. He said the agreements also would cover 11,000 non-union employees at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, such as reservation clerks, ticket agents, and clerical workers. A representative of non-union employees, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Shore </PERSON>, said her group objected to not being represented in the talks. Ms. Shore sits on the Eastern unsecured creditors committee. <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> has said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> could begin expanding its schedule 24 hours after final agreements are reahced between his group, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and the unions. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON>, an Eastern spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, said Monday it could take 10 days for the airline to resume 80 percent of its prestrike schedule of 1,040 daily flights once the unions agreed to return. The delay would stem from needed maintenance and inspection of idled planes, ferrying of aircraft to appropriate airports, recalling laid-off employees and other logistical tasks. Using non-union employees and non-striking 200 pilots, Eastern is flying about 110 flights daily, focusing on its Northeast shuttle and Latin American routes. The airline has a deal to sell the shuttle to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> for $ 365 million. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, a vice chairman of the master executive council of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, estimated it could take 45-60 days for Eastern to resume a full schedule once striking employees return. Union officials also said it would be foolish and costly to restore a full schedule immediately because <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, already carrying a heavy debt, would have few passengers in the days immediately following resumption of service. Separately, a federal appeals court upheld injunctions barring <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> metropolitan-area passenger rail workers from striking in sympathy with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> employees. The 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld a lower court ruling that the federal Railway Labor Act barred unionized workers at the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rail </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commuter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> from honoring the picket lines of striking Eastern machinists. Sympathy strikes at the railroads would have affected about 400,000 commuters.
