<HEAD>Former Law Student Called `Viable Suspect' in Green River Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A former law student is a `` viable suspect'' in the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> slayings, the nation's worst serial murder case, according to court documents released Thursday. The Green River case involves the deaths of 41 women and the disappearance of at least eight others in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> in 1982-85. Most of the victims were young and almost all were linked to prostitution. Former law student <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, 38, was named in an affidavit made public Thursday. The affidavit was filed to support a search warrant for two of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' residences in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, 290 miles east of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. The searches Wednesday yielded a truckload of crime reports, maps, credit card receipts, 1,800 videotapes, 14 police badges and two <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> police uniform shirts, other court documents showed. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> is serving a one-year term in the King County Jail for the burglary of a police equipment supply store in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> in 1979. Police say <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> walked away from a work-release program in 1981 and was not located until last December, when he was in his final year at the <ORGANIZATION> Gonzaga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law school in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>. He was arrested and returned to jail Jan. 9. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> has not been charged in the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> investigation. His father, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, when reached by telephone in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> on Thursday, said, `` I've been advised by my attorney not to answer any questions.'' The <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> case takes its name from the river south of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> where the bodies of the first five victims were found. Most of the bodies were found in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area. Four were found in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, Ore. The tip to <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' whereabouts came in a call from <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, after a television program last December about the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> killings, police said. The search warrant for a house rented by <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> and for his parents' house said there was `` probable cause to believe that the crime of murder has been committed.'' <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> investigators have long theorized that the victims might have been lured into the killer's car by someone posing as a police officer or otherwise in a position of trust. `` One of the things that was speculated ... the killer could be a cop or someone posing as a cop,'' King County Police Capt. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, commander of the multi-agency <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday. Before <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> was arrested in January, <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> police determined that he owned a former <LOCATION> Everett </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, police car which had been equipped and made to appear like a real police car, the affidavit said. The police car had been falsely registered by <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, who had represented himself as the police chief of Spangle, a town 15 miles south of <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>. Part of the investigation includes a time line which traces his travels from <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, and to <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>. The 405 entries on the 1981-88 time-line `` tended to place <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> in the area during the time space of a <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> victim's disappearance,'' the affidavit said `` None of the documented contacts, telephone records or credit card charges served to eliminate <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> as a suspect in any of the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> cases,'' the affidavit said. `` Instead, interviews and records have produced the following facts that tend to establish that <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> is a viable suspect in the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> homicides,'' the document said. Other material taken in the searches included boxes of 1982 newspapers, <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> sex crime reports and <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> police crime synopses from 1983. The affidavit said task force files contained several tips suggesting <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> might have been linked to the killings.

 A small plane with a stricken pilot flew hundreds of miles down the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> on autopilot shadowed by military jets Thursday, finally running out of gas and spiraling into the ocean. The pilot then emerged from the wreckage and swam toward his startled rescuers, authorities said. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Root </PERSON>, a 36-year-old lawyer from <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, was pulled from Bahamian waters by <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> parachutists four hours after he had first radioed he was in trouble. He was first taken to <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> and a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> helicopter then flew him to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` For him to survive a crash like that, it just sent us all into shock,'' said Petty Officer <PERSON> Veronica </PERSON> <PERSON> Cady </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. `` We did n't expect this story to have a happy ending.'' Coast Guard Capt. Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> said Root may have passed out from carbon monoxide poisoning in the cockpit of his single-engine <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> and that water splashing in his face apparently roused him. Root was taken to Memorial Hospital in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, where he underwent three-hours of exploratory surgery for possible internal injuries. After the operation, his condition was upgraded from critical to stable, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Wine </PERSON>. Root's family requested no information be released on his injuries, she said. Root's wife, <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON>, 35, told reporters from the porch of the family home that her husband had been awake and talking to doctors. She said she told hospital officials to send her husband the following message: `` Root, you really did it this time.'' The drama began about 8:30 a.m. when Root, who had taken off from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> about 6:30 a.m. for <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, radioed air traffic controllers in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. `` Yessir, we're having a little problem up here,'' <PERSON> Root </PERSON> told controllers, according to a tape of the conversation played by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> television station <ORGANIZATION> WRC-TV </ORGANIZATION>. `` Seem to have a little trouble breathing,'' said Root, who also reported chest pain. `` How far am I to Rocky Mount now?'' `` You're about 17 minutes from <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION>,'' replied an unidentified controller. `` Uh,'' said the pilot. `` Niner niner one three <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION>, do you hear?'' said the controller, calling the plane's number. There was no further radio contact, and military pilots who tailed the plane reported he was slumped behind the controls as his plane flew south off the coast, occasionally getting within 100 miles of the shore. Military pilots and rescuers trained to parachute into the ocean to save ditched pilots could only watch helplessly as their aircraft tracked the plane until it ran out of gas. After more than 3 -LCB- hours of radio silence, the plane spiraled into the water and Root was rescued, 800 miles from his original destination in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and 250 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` The words you keep hearing are, ` You're kidding,''' said Ms. <PERSON> Cady </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said the plane went down about 15 miles east of the island of <LOCATION> Eleuthera </LOCATION>. `` It spiraled into the water, so it did n't make the best of all possible landings,'' said Chief Petty Officer <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Parris </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lt </ORGANIZATION>. Commander <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Poll </PERSON>, who was at the scene in a jet when <PERSON> Root </PERSON> crashed, said the plane was at about 7,000 feet when it began spiraling in like a corkscrew and spinning down at about 2,000 feet per minute. Poll said the nose and left wing hit the water at the same time and the plane swiveled on its belly on a 360-degree spin. He said it stayed afloat for several minutes and started to sink. Air Force Sgt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>, one of four <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technicians </ORGANIZATION> who parachuted into the water, said <PERSON> Root </PERSON> was first spotted swimming away from the wreckage dressed only in pants and socks. Root was pulled onto a raft and given first aid, said <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>, based at the <ORGANIZATION> 301st </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recovery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Homestead </LOCATION>, about 20 miles south of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` He told us his abdomen is hurting a lot and we could see he was bleeding,'' said <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>. `` It was incredible. He had a sense of humor about it.'' <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON>, the doctor who treated Root in <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Root </PERSON> was alert and could speak well but seemed to be in shock and had abdominal injuries and fractured ribs. <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> said there was no indication of a heart attack and Root had no history of heart trouble. `` It's definitely a miracle he's alive. He's a little confused by it all,'' the doctor said. After its distress call, the plane was intercepted by two <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> F-A-18 jet fighters when it entered <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> Naval Station airspace at 8:45 a.m., said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The pilots of the intercepting planes tried unsuccessfully to contact the pilot by radio, he said. The Cessna 210 Centurion can seat four to six people, counting the pilot, and cruises at about 190 mph. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierman </PERSON>, shift supervisor in the air traffic control tower at <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> Raleigh </ORGANIZATION> radio station <ORGANIZATION> WPTF </ORGANIZATION> that the autopilot was set on a heading that would have sent the plane toward <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. `` Put an airplane on automatic pilot and it's going to continue just exactly on the course that the automatic pilot is set for,'' he said. At time of crash, <PERSON> Root </PERSON> was followed by a C-130 cargo plane from <ORGANIZATION> Homestead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and an HH3 helicopter from <ORGANIZATION> Patrick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, also on <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanek </PERSON> of Homestead. A flight surgeon was part of the rescue teams, she said.

<HEAD>Soviets Plan to Launch Ads Into Space, Newspaper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has hired a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> advertising company to sell broadcast rights and corporate sponsorships for the first British-Soviet space mission, scheduled for 1991, a newspaper reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said the Soviets have hired the <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest advertising and marketing conglomerate, to exploit the commercial opportunities of the Juno mission. The mission, which will carry <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s first astronaut into orbit from a launching pad in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, will be financed entirely by the sale of commercial opportunities, the newspaper said. That includes the sale of space aboard the Soviets' Mir space station for scientific payloads. The Times reported that more than 10,000 men and woman responded to an advertisement <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON> placed in several British newspapers in late June that carried the headline: `` Astronaut wanted. No experience necessary.'' If the Soviets are successful in this and other commerical ventures, a soft drink or cheesburger may be advertised on the side of a Soviet Soyuz rocket, while commericals to promote a sneaker as the official athletic footwear of the space product, the newspaper said. The Soviet space agency, Glavkosmos, two weeks ago gave <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the exclusive right to market its goods and services in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Glavkosmos has signed commerical agreements with several Western companies. In March, a Japanese televison network paid the agency 12 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars for the right to send a correspondent into space in 1991. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which administers the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space program, does not accept advertising or payment from private citizens for flights. In the past, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space shuttles have carried some projects for a fee, but that practice was canceled after the Challenger explosion in 1986 that killed seven astronauts.

<DATELINE>SALFIT, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For nearly a year, this was a `` liberated'' village. Outlawed <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> flags fluttered from light poles, activists patrolled the streets, slogans covered the walls, and popular committees did the work of city hall. No longer. At dawn on July 5, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers stormed the village of 5,000 people, and reopened army-run government offices, which had been attacked and burned by rioters in January. `` This is a test case. We went in because <LOCATION> Salfit </LOCATION> had been portrayed as a main center of the intefadeh,'' or Palestinian uprising, said Col. <PERSON> Udi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagey </PERSON>. He referred to Palistinian statements that the village had been `` liberated'' from <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. Of the 420 villages in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, several dozen like <LOCATION> Salfit </LOCATION> have declared themselves `` liberated.'' <PERSON> Sagey </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> unit in the area, said he planned to reopen its medical center, reconnect the telephones, restore postal and agricultural extension services, and resume construction of a new road. `` The first goal of the intefadeh leaders has been to cut the ties between the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities and the people,'' he said. `` If the economic support to these people is greater, maybe they will be less radical towards Israeli authorities.'' He said he hoped if normal life was restored in <LOCATION> Salfit </LOCATION>, it would have an impact on neighboring villages that depend on <LOCATION> Salfit </LOCATION> for services. Since the start of the 19-month Palestinian uprising, <LOCATION> Salfit </LOCATION> was largely ignored by the army because it is isolated at the end of a single-lane road. The village is only 18 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, but it is in rocky hills far from main highways and Jewish settlements. In January, Palestinian rioters forced the closure of all government offices and activists bedecked <LOCATION> Salfit </LOCATION> with symbols of independence: red, black, white and green <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> flags and a map of the would-be <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state on a wall in the town center. Popular committees made up of activists aligned with the <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> faction and communist groups organized underground schools, medical services, street cleaning and agriculture. In short, <LOCATION> Salfit </LOCATION> became a microcosm for the independent state that Palestinians hope they can achieve if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 21-year occupation is ended. `` There is no higher voice than the voice of the intefadeh,'' declared graffiti, freshly painted on a wall where the army had covered over previous slogans. <PERSON> Rafaat </PERSON>, 29, a blacksmith talking with friends at a shop on the village's main <LOCATION> Gamal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Abdel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nasser </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, said there has been little resistance to the army takeover because about 200 activists fled into the countryside to avoid arrest. `` We were liberated for a few months. But now there is more tension because at any moment a soldier can stop you or arrest you,'' said <PERSON> Rafaat </PERSON>, who declined to give his full name for fear of reprisal. The streets still bear the evidence of past protests: the remains of burned tires and scorched stones blocking part of one entrance to the village. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>, a 25-year-old grocer, said soldiers patrol frequently, but there were some small acts of defiance. He said youths had hung about 100 flags the previous night. This was disputed by a soldier standing guard outside the new military encampment that sported an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> flag. He said there had been only two flags. `` The town is so quiet now that we go on patrol with just our berets and no helmets,'' he added. About a dozen Palestinians gathered at the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> offices. One man said he wanted an entry permit to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> for a relative who lives in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>; another said he wanted a travel document to return to his job in the <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. Yet another, wearing a bandage to cover a head wound he said was inflicted by soldiers, had come to get his ID card that had been taken during a search-and-arrest raid. All were kept waiting several hours even though a reporter who entered the encampment found two army offices sitting alone in their offices. `` Let them wait for awhile,'' said the guard with a shrug. <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Maadi </PERSON>, a doctor who lives in a spacious villa on the edge of town, said <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists and the army were watching each other carefully to see what would happen next. `` It will not stop in <LOCATION> Salfit </LOCATION> as long as the intefadeh continues elsewhere in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. It will not stop until there is some hope offered for the future,'' said <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Maadi </PERSON>, 37. During the course of the uprising, he said, three Palestinians from <LOCATION> Salfit </LOCATION> had been shot to death and about 50 wounded. About 250 had been detained at one point or another. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Maadi </PERSON> said arbitrary actions and collective punishments had left a feeling of resentment toward <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. He said that after a Jewish settler was killed in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> in June, soldiers came to his house, broke the porch lights and smashed a front window. `` I came downstairs and opened the door. An officer hit me in the face without warning or comment. He then ordered me to go to the school where everyone was being rounded up,'' <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Maadi </PERSON> said. `` If I do something wrong, I will accept punishment. But this is punishing everyone.''

<DATELINE>ABOARD THE SOVIET CRUISER TALLINN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Soviet navy sought a high seas show of glasnost, but dense fog obscured much of the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>'s two-day maneuvers and hampered its planned display of firepower. It invited reporters from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, who went aboard the anti-submarine vessel <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> to watch the exercises in the Sea of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Also on board were officials from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> rejected an invitation but dispatched the frigate USS Holt and at least one helicopter to keep an eye on the maneuvers, Soviet officials said. The fog, which rolled in Monday evening and remained for the next two days, made much of the observation of the ships, planes and helicopters impossible. The navy was forced to alter its plans for mock battles and conduct a short-range demonstration of anti-ship missiles, depth charges, anti-aircraft guns and rocket-launched torpedos. The Soviets also arranged a tour of a destroyer at fleet headquarters in <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION> and a launch ride to view the task force at anchor. They allowed reporters to wander about the ships to which they were assigned. Inquiries about specific weapons and plans were ignored, however, and a request to visit the <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Combat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the nerve center of a modern naval vessel, was politely rejected with the explanation that the captain was too busy. Observers did see two ships ready for inspection. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> paint, some of it fresh, covered most surfaces on the <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> and the destroyer Stoiki. Brass name plates were polished. The portraits of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Soviet founder <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> were in place along the gangways. In the sailors' quarters, personal belongings were put away and all bunks were made. No space was wasted. Each ordinary sailor, practically all of whom are drafted, gets one-third of the space beneath the bottom bunk for uniforms, a cubbyhole for toiletries, and a cabinet large enough to hold about three books for personal belongings. Asked how he liked maritime life, a 17-year-old sailor standing watch for the visitors replied with a shrug. `` Service is service,'' he said. One officer said only 10 percent of the conscripts re-enlist after their three-year stint.

The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> have never signed a peace treaty ending the war, largely because of the dispute over possession of the Kuril islands, known as the Northern Territories in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Western naval experts, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> encouraged its <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> allies to stay away because it does not want to feel obligated to invite Soviet officers aboard ship during annual exercises by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 3rd Fleet.

 The <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> zoo has become the world's first to artificially breed a crested ibis, a long-billed wading bird that is near extinction, the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Daily said today. The 2-ounce bird was born Monday, ending a three-year effort by the zoo to find a way to artificially propagate the species, the official daily said. It said the 4-year-old mother delivered two eggs in mid-June, but pecked one of the babies to death. The other was removed to a breeding box for special care. The crested ibis was once found in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but its population has declined dramatically because of destruction to its environment, the daily said.

 A horse that knows when it's safe to cross intersections allows a blind former cowboy to keep his independence, but the city says the man must clean up after the animal or lose the privilege. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON>, 69, who retains about 1 percent of his sight in one eye, has a year to persuade the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to let him keep two horses, Blue Rocky and Buck, in his back yard. When <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> rides Blue Rocky through town, the horse stops at intersections and does n't move until traffic is flowing in the direction the horse is supposed to go. In 1981, the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> granted <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> a lifetime zoning variance allowing him to keep the horses in town. But inspectors reported in 1987 that <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> was n't cleaning up after the horses and was bothering neighbors with the smell. The variance was revoked and a judge fined <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> $ 100. The fine was thrown out on appeal. Last month, a judge gave <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> a year to change the council's mind or move the horses `` Now, hopefully, what we're doing is right,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. `` As far as being unfair, he's the one who's being unfair to his neighbors.'' <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> said the neighbor behind the complaints is <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, who wanted to sell his house next door but was afraid <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON>'s horses would lower property values. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> is not on speaking terms with <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> nor with reporters. `` I do n't want to say nothing about that crap. No, bye,'' he said, hanging up. <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON>, who likes to smoke hand-rolled cigarettes and reminisce about the days when he worked as a cowboy in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, had to stop working in 1964 because of retinitis pigmentosa, a hereditary degenerative eye disease. But <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> likes to ride Blue Rocky the two miles to downtown <LOCATION> Artesia </LOCATION>, across six intersections with stoplights. He could see better about 10 years ago, when he got Blue Rocky and started leading the horse on his walks into town. When <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> heard traffic going in the direction he was walking, that meant the light had turned green and he would cross the intersection. Now the horse decides when it's time to cross. `` He automatically stops anyhow at any intersection,'' <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> said. `` I guarantee you he wo n't go unless the traffic is going my way. Whether he can read the light is the $ 64 question.'' Other times, <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> rides his horse into the hills west of his house. `` You know, I can get kind of down and out because I ca n't work, and get on that old horse and ride five or six miles and, hey, I got a different outlook on life all of a sudden,'' <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> said. `` I'm completely independent. He shudders at the thought of losing his horses. `` Oh, I suppose somebody could take me places, but you have to go back when they want to go back _ you know, you're not independent.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> is gone. Will the theater world ever see his like again? Said critic <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, who wrote in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> died Tuesday: `` No one will replace the splendor that he gave his native land with his genius.'' Other critics say that while another <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> may be in the wings, they feel today's entertainment industry makes it doubtful. Primarily a man of the stage, <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> became a superstar in all media. The sheer quantity of his work is among the most noteworthy aspects of a career that ended with his death at age 82, at his country home south of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> was also the consummate actor-manager _ a passionate theater advocate as important behind the scenes as a director and organizer as he was on stage as a performer. Few theater observers would dispute that first-rate <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> actors continue to abound. <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON> <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>, <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> McKellen </PERSON> are just some of the generation after <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> who have been widely and often acclaimed. Then there's a still younger generation less known abroad but already staring greatness in the eye: <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Branagh </PERSON>, <PERSON> Antony </PERSON> <PERSON> Sher </PERSON>, <PERSON> Juliet </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fiona </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>. And although <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>'s death is being called the end of an era, he is survived by such stalwart knights and dames of stage as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gielgud </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Guinness </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON>. But it's <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>'s level of commitment to the art form he cherished that may be in shorter supply. `` Will anyone ever again go on for so long, play so many great parts, run so many companies?'' asked <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Coveney </PERSON> in The Financial Times. `` Will they want to enough? We must doubt it until they do.'' <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Shulman </PERSON> in The Evening Standard also feared such dedication was dying. `` The likes of <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>, nurtured on greasepaint, the footlights, and the effrontery of daring an audience to like you, are fast becoming an endangered species.'' The stage instead, he wrote, is `` fast becoming the casting kindergarten for film and TV.'' The trend is increasing in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> as talented young theater actors opt for the greater financial rewards of film and TV. <PERSON> Natasha </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilby </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Amanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Donohoe </PERSON> are just some of the classically schooled young English talents who work mostly on screen. Among the older generation, none has matched the initiative of <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>, who in 1963 realized an old dream of establishing a National Theater of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. `` The quality of work we do here is mostly due to him,'' veteran actor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> told Tuesday night's audience at the National's production of `` The Voysey Inheritance. Some feel <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>'s death ends a kind of theatrical majesty that transcends issues of talent. In an editorial entitled `` Stage Colossus,'' The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> wrote: `` He was the undisputed leader of his profession, its spokesman, and the brightest jewel in its crown. We shall not look upon his like again.'' <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> wrote: `` What we have lost with <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> is glory. ... You could practically see it growing around him like a nimbus.'' <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Quilley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>'s co-star in a celebrated <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> production of <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s `` Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' said in an interview, `` There are people today -LRB- like <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> -RRB- but not on the same scale.'' Would-be inheritors most frequently mentioned are men like <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Pennington </PERSON> and the protean <PERSON> Branagh </PERSON>, <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pringle </PERSON> in the TV series `` Fortunes of War,'' who combine thespian dynamism with a team spirit. Both have started theater companies _ <PERSON> Pennington </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> English </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, which finished a world tour in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> this spring, and <PERSON> Branagh </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Renaissance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, which had a sell-out <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> season on the West End last fall. <PERSON> Branagh </PERSON>, 28, tempted further comparisons to <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> by starring on stage and screen as <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> V </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>'s most celebrated achievements. <PERSON> Branagh </PERSON>'s film is due out in the fall. <PERSON> Antony </PERSON> <PERSON> Sher </PERSON>'s 1984 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> also was likened to <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>'s. But South African-born Sher, 40, has forsaken the spotlight to focus on writing. <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rigg </PERSON>, who appeared with <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Stratford-upon-Avon </LOCATION> and in his 1983 TV `` King <PERSON> Lear </PERSON>,'' says the case is n't closed on greatness. `` It's impossible to say you'll never see the likes of him again,'' she said in an interview. `` The profession is full of incredibly talented people, some in the cradle.''

<UNK>Briton Claims Record As First Woman To Cross English Channel By Hang
Glider</UNK>
<DATELINE>DOVER, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Briton has claimed a place in the record books as the first woman to cross the English Channel by hang glider, making the 21-mile trip to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 22 minutes. Strapped into her frail craft, 29-year-old <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leden </PERSON> was first lifted to 13,500 feet over <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION> by a hot air balloon Wednesday morning. The balloon's pilot, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, then cut the rope on which the hang glider was suspended 30 feet below his craft, sending the glider into a spinning 200-foot nose dive before it leveled out and began its downward glide. Miss <PERSON> Leden </PERSON> came down on a beach at Le Chatelet midway between the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> north coast ports of <LOCATION> Calais </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boulogne </LOCATION>. After landing, she admitted to being scared at the start of the flight: `` It was the highest I had ever been with a hang glider so I was going into the unknown. `` I am not frightened very easily but I was terrified for a short time. Because of the thinness of the air at 13,000 feet I went to at least 110 degrees and was rotating very fast, which is the way the hang glider recovers and begins to fly. `` I kept my nerve ... but once that horrible moment was over I had a lovely smooth glide over to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.'' Preparations for the flight, which was sponsored by an auto company, were dogged by technical problems for a year. But Miss <PERSON> Leden </PERSON> said Wednesday's crossing was `` incredibly smooth, without any serious complications.'' Miss Leden, from <LOCATION> Derbyshire </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, holds the women's world open distance hang gliding record of 145.34 miles. That flight, listed in the Guinness Book of Records, was between <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> over <LOCATION> Owens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> on July 13, 1983. She was honored by Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> this year by being made a Member of the Order of the British Empire in recognition of her services to the sport. British news reports said the only other hang glider pilot to fly across the English Channel was Briton <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Messenger </PERSON> in 1977. He suffered frostbite because of cold at the high altitude from which he started. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement after <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Leden </PERSON>'s crossing Wednesday that for safety reasons it will not allow any further hang gliding attempts across the English Channel. The skies above the Channel are a major commercial air route.

<TEXT>
 Britons are witnessing something that has become unusual in the past decade of union-curbing Thatcherism: a striking blue-collar union is enjoying a measure of public sympathy. Wednesday saw the fourth one-day strike in a month of the national rail network and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> subways. Yet the union leaders, while hardly popular national figures, appear as people with a real grievance. `` They're enjoying a remarkable amount of public support considering how hard the public is hit directly,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>, editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION>, a independent monthly. He attributes this to a general sense that <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> is underpaying its staff as Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> cuts the state-owned company's subsidies to the lowest in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The goal, in line with the free-market philosophy of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, is to make British Rail self-financing. But what the public mostly sees is higher fares, demoralized staff and falling service standards. A Gallup poll shows 69 percent of Britons favor more subsidies, not less. With unfortunate timing, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> announced in the middle of the pay dispute that its profits were a record $ 492 million last year, largely from real estate sales. Meanwhile, the media are focusing on recent hefty pay increases for top executives, such as the 86.5 percent raise for <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, chairman of Cable and Wireless, who now earns $ 630,780 a year. With overtime, train drivers average $ 24,840 a year and they want a 10 percent raise to beat the 8.3 percent inflation rate. A poll Wednesday in the usually pro-Thatcher Daily Mail showed that of 2,770 rail passengers questioned, only 23 percent placed sole blame on the unions. It said 33 percent blamed management, 20 percent blamed the government, and 14 percent thought all sides were guilty. Ten percent had no opinion. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s last big battle against organized labor ended with a crushing defeat for the coal miners in 1985, and widespread applause for the prime minister's tough stand. But <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON>, head of the 75,000 member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railwaymen </ORGANIZATION>, is a benign figure, when compared to <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Scargill </PERSON>, the Marxist miners' leader who led surging crowds of pickets in pitched battles with police. A gruff man with tufts of snow-white hair, <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON> sticks to a simple unpolitical message: that <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION>'s 7 percent pay raise offer is below inflation, and that it wants to break up the union and weaken its collective bargaining power. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> says the strikers are selfish and dominated by left-wing extremists, but in the image war, <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON> puts up a credible challenge. It has been some time since a British union boss was described in print as `` cuddly.'' Transport Minister <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON>'s well-publicized walks to work on strike days were dismissed by the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> as `` embarrassingly unconvincing.'' And British Rail apparently miscalculated when, instead of waiting for the result of an arbitration effort, it asked the courts to ban the strike. The courts refused, and the public's sense of fair play was offended because the union had scrupulously obeyed Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s union-curbing laws by balloting its members and obtaining the necessary 55 percent majority for a strike There are no mass pickets at train stations, just silence. Columnist <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, in the liberal Observer newspaper, wonders what `` has happened to all those gentlemen, usually wearing bowler hats, who would enliven any railway dispute by assaulting station staff with their umbrellas?'' The transport strikes are part of a wave of industrial unrest also hitting the docks, the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> and local government services. Coupled with resurgent inflation and rising interest rates, they have pushed Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> to 10 points behind the socialist <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in opinion polls. Ironically, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s own success in taming organized labor may now be working against her. Britons elected her in 1979 because they wanted a tough response to unions that were perceived as too left-wing and powerful. That perception has since waned. `` A decade ago, 80 percent of people thought the trade unions were too powerful. Now it's down to three in 10,'' says <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Worcester </PERSON>, head of Market and <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. `` A decade ago, 53 percent said most trade unions were controlled by extremists and militants, now it's only 20 percent.'' `` In a sense, the ballot has given strikes a spurious sense of legitimacy,'' said <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Mather </PERSON> of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>. He wants the government to implement its threat to ban strikes in essential services.

 A newlywed couple looking through the ashes of what had been their home found most of their belongings destroyed by a wildfire. Their dog found a stray cat _ singed but alive _ inside the refrigerator. `` We lost everything. I do n't even have proof of who I am,'' said <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Voit-Perry </PERSON>. <PERSON> Voit-Perry </PERSON> said she and her husband, <PERSON> Pete </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> football player, were married June 24 and were on a honeymoon until July 5, four days before the fire broke out. The blaze, which started Sunday, burned 2,000 acres in the <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION>, and destroyed 37 homes and numerous other structures. Officials expected to bring it under control today. The couple fled as fire engulfed the ridgetop house where they had planned to begin married life. <PERSON> Voit-Perry </PERSON>, 29, said among the items lost in the blaze were wedding gifts, including cash, a gas barbecue and handmade quilts from friends. `` I would say, ` I'm going to take a picture of the property,''' <PERSON> Voit-Perry </PERSON> said after looking over the damage Tuesday. `` <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> would say, ` We do n't have a camera any more' ... the realization is setting in.'' But her dog, <PERSON> Zack </PERSON>, sniffed at the refrigerator, which the cat somehow managed to use as a shelter. The 3-year-old, 9 -LCB- - pound female cat was taken to the All Pets Clinic in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> where it was treated for injuries to its paws and a high fever Dr. <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurule </PERSON> said it should survive.

 Upsetting a time-honored tradition of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>, Deputy Speaker <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Boothroyd </PERSON> told a legislator to stop calling her Mr. and start calling her Madam. In accordance with usual practice, legislator <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Winterton </PERSON> of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday referred to <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Boothroyd </PERSON> as `` Mr. Deputy Speaker'' during a late-night debate in the absence of Speaker <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Weatherill </PERSON>. But Miss <PERSON> Boothroyd </PERSON> told her: `` I long to be a female. Vive la difference. I am Madam Deputy Speaker.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Winterton </PERSON> replied: `` I am a traditionalist and I hope you will not mind, Mr. Deputy Speaker, if I refer to you as Mr.'' But Miss <PERSON> Boothroyd </PERSON> did. `` While I am in the chair, I am to be addressed as Madam Deputy Speaker,'' she ruled. The Commons clings to a variety of strange customs and rituals inherited from the past. The `` Mr. Deputy Speaker'' tag dates back to the all-male days before 1919, when <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Astor </PERSON> became the first woman legislator.

 The Marines were battling for every inch of beachhead and met no resistance from about 2,000 spectators. Four amphibious landing craft from the USS Boulder bounded ashore Wednesday and disgorged 90 Marines in full battle gear.

 A man climbed into a hot tub with a joke and planned to keep up the routine for three days to set a new mark for hot tub humor. `` It's great. Surf's up,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said about a half-hour into his marathon Wednesday. He plans to stay there for at least 73 hours, until Saturday morning. He started out with some elephant jokes. `` Why do elephants have flat feet?'' he asked. `` It's obviously because they jump out of trees.'' `` Most of the jokes are off the top of my head and are jokes I've collected from 19 years in the radio business,'' said <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, 36 `` Of course, after 27 hours or so you begin to hallucinate, so fortunately the Guinness people allow me to use cue cards.'' The 1989 edition of the <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> lists him as the record-holder for time spent telling jokes in a hot tub with a 52-hour effort, but someone in <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> has topped that mark.

I can go numb, nod off. Any higher than 90, and I can boil myself without knowing it.'' Wrinkled feet are another hazard, said <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, who has survived four tub-joking marathons. He plans to solve the problem by keeping his feet out of the water much of the time. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> has a penchant for spending long periods in odd places. `` I once sat in spaghetti for three days,'' he said. Unfortunately, <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> lists no record for spaghetti-sitting.

 House Republicans and Democrats are forecasting a rocky congressional ride for the stealth bomber despite the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> assessment that the half-billion-dollar aircraft is key to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strategic forces. `` The B-2 program is in a lot of trouble,'' Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials who pleaded their case Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> was to present his argument for the bomber today before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel. Air Force Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> and Chief of Staff <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> met with stiff resistance from lawmakers Wednesday as they urged members at <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sessions to continue spending for the $ 70 billion program. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> and <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> told the committee that stretching out the B-2 program would increase the cost significantly. Current estimates put the pricetag of a single bomber between $ 500 million and $ 750 million, making it the most expensive plane in history. Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said extending the program could raise the price of a single bomber to $ 1 billion `` If you make the annual cost acceptable, the sticker price becomes unacceptable,'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said. `` If you make the sticker price acceptable, the annual cost becomes unacceptable. I do n't know how to fix it.'' Moments after <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>'s comments, <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> put it more bluntly to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials. `` When the chairman tells you you're not going to get it politically, you can put it in your pocket and take it to the bank,'' <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., added: `` I want to put my head down and cry You made a compelling case but I do n't know where to get the money to pay for it.'' Two committee Republicans _ Reps. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> _ have joined forces with liberal Democrat <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on an amendment to shut down production of the B-2 after the manufacturer, <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, produced 13 planes. The amendment, which the lawmakers said they will introduce on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor, would allow the 13 planes to be developed and tested and then a decision would be made on whether to continue the program. `` It's a reasonable, moderate position,'' said <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, who believes the coalition can win support from members stunned by the cost of the radar-evading aircraft. But the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> argues the B-2 outpaces improvements in Soviet air defenses, is important to nuclear deterrence and can be used in a conventional role. Despite the sticker shock, the B-2 `` comes down as the only candidate for some categories of things we want to do,'' <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The 1989 wheat crop is turning out better than many believe possible a few months ago, but it still is far short in many areas where last year's drought lingered on. New Agriculture Department estimates put the harvest at 2.12 billion bushels, a 17 percent increase from last year's 1.81 billion bushels and the most since 1985 when farmers produced 2.43 billion bushels. For the first time this season, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> estimates issued Wednesday included durum and `` other'' spring-planted wheat, in addition to winter wheat planted last fall. <PERSON> Reggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyckoff </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> estimate was `` a little higher'' than he had expected and that there will be adequate supplies through the 1989-90 marketing year if the current projections are correct. `` But it also shows evidence that there is disaster in many areas'' where wheat yields have tumbled, <PERSON> Wyckoff </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` It's pretty rough in hard, red winter wheat areas.'' The department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said the average yield, based on indications as of July 1, was estimated at 33.4 bushels per acre, down from 34.1 bushels last year. But farmers are expected to have about 63.5 million acres of wheat for harvest this year, up from 53.2 million in 1988, the board said in its report. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s first official estimate of 1989 production of corn, soybeans and some other major spring-planted crops will be issued on Aug. 10, along with revised figures for wheat. However, the July report did show new figures for 1989 plantings of major crops. Corn plantings were estimated at 65.8 million acres for harvest, up from 58.2 million acres in 1988, and soybeans, 60.2 million acres, up from 57.4 million. Cotton plantings were estimated at 10.5 million acres, down 16 percent from 1988. That was also 5 percent below a preliminary forecast in March. Winter wheat production was estimated at 1.46 billion bushels, down 6 percent from 1988, reduced sharply in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and some other parts of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> by lingering effects of last year's drought It makes up about three-fourths of total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat production. The <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> wheat crop estimate, however, was boosted slightly to 211.2 million bushels from the June forecast of 202.4 million. Even so, it was down by more than a third from last year. Winter wheat fared better in 1988 because most was harvested or had matured before the full impact of heat and drought was felt. Durum wheat production was estimated at 111.3 million bushels, up from 44.8 million in 1988, and `` other'' spring wheat was indicated at 544.1 million bushels, compared with 205.5 million last year. Department economists say the decline in wheat supplies since last year's reduced harvest is having only slight effect on consumer food prices, which are expected to rise an average of 4 percent to 7 percent, compared with a 4.1 percent gain in 1988. A related supply-and-demand report showed that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat inventories may total 592 million bushels by the end of the current marketing year next May 31, down from 694 million bushels this June 1. Last month, when the crop was thought to be smaller, analysts projected inventories could decline to 500 million bushels next spring. The report showed wheat prices could average $ 3.75 to $ 4.10 per bushel in 1989-90, down from the range of $ 3.80 to $ 4.20 projected in June but still above the $ 3.72 average for last season. Wheat exports were projected at around 1.23 billion bushels, down from 1.44 billion bushels in 1988-89. Corn production, based on past trends and the current outlook, was projected at 7.45 billion bushels, up from last year's drought-shriveled 4.92 billion bushels But the July corn outlook was down from June's projection of 7.85 billion bushels, due partly to late plantings in the eastern Corn Belt and `` continued limited moisture'' conditions in the west. The soybean crop was projected at 1.95 billion bushels, unchanged from the June forecast and up sharply from 1988 output of 1.54 billion bushels. The price outlook also was unchanged at $ 4.75 to $ 6.25 per bushel, compared with an average of $ 7.35 in 1988-89.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has proposed a technical measure designed to speed the reduction of barriers to trade in farm products. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> says the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration wants other nations to convert non-tariff import barriers, such as quotas and restrictive licenses, to tariffs. `` By converting to tariffs, barriers would be more transparent and uniform, making it easier to negotiate worldwide reductions in agriculture support and protection,'' she said Wednesday in a statement. The proposal was made in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in trade negotiations with 100 other nations under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, which regulates world trade treaties and settles commerce disputes. The current series of talks, known as the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round, began in 1986 and are scheduled to run through next year. In April, <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> negotiators achieved a breakthrough in the talks, which had been deadlocked since December, reaching broad agreement in four key areas, including a compromise on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand to do away with all trade-distorting agricultural subsidies. The talks since then have been aimed at nailing down specifics of how to achieve the goals of the larger compromise. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` tariffication'' proposal must be part of a more comprehensive package including fundamental reforms in domestic farm subsidies, export subsidies and sanitary rules.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> disagrees with American scientists who say their visit to a long-secret Soviet laser research center convinces them the facility is not a threat to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> satellites. A <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said Wednesday that videotape taken by the scientists of the Sary-Shagan laser facility in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> `` only firms up'' the department's view that the laser facility is capable of incapacitating <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> satellites. The scientists, however, said Wednesday their inspection of the facility last week convinced them it poses no military threat. They said the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> had greatly exaggerated the facility's importance. `` This facility really has n't had large resources devoted to it since the 1970s,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Hippel </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, one of the scientists who visited the site as part of a broader inspection program sanctioned by the Soviet government. The scientists showed the videotapes at a news conference Wednesday. No <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government officials were included in the visit. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official, who asked that he not be identified, said the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> still believes that while the Sary-Shagan laser center may be unable to knock a satellite out of space, it can do enough damage to `` negate our satellite capabilities.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pike </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientists </ORGANIZATION> told reporters the Sary-Shagan laser is not powerful enough to shoot down satellites or ballistic missiles. He said it was 100 to 1,000 times less powerful than an American power laser at <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, that he called only marginally capable of shooting down satellites. <PERSON> Pike </PERSON> was not on the tour but described for reporters his analysis of the photographic and other evidence gathered by the tour group, which also visited a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear weapons production center and conducted radiation experiments on a nuclear-armed <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> cruiser in the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. He noted the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, beginning in 1984, had described the laser center as the heart of an ominous Soviet anti-satellite program with ground-based lasers that could shoot down satellites and in the future might be able to destroy ballistic missiles. `` It is clear that the threat posed by this facility has been wildly exaggerated over the last several years,'' <PERSON> Pike </PERSON> said, adding the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> claims represented either a major intelligence failure or a deliberate effort to mislead the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, a staff scientist with the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the tour group, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials were invited to go along but declined. Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>, D-Mich., who participated in the tour, said Soviet willingness to allow Americans to inspect the previously secret laser facility and other military installations was clear evidence of `` extraordinary steps'' being taken by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to promote the arms control process <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> said Soviet officials told him during the tour that legislation was being prepared to permit more public disclosures about <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear weapons production.

 FOOD for <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, a pet charity of a former top official at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, has raised thousands of dollars without proper registration in several states, according to records. A check by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> of the offices of state attorneys general and other agencies regulating charities found FOOD is not registered in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> or its home state of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. The organization raised at least $ 580,000 from 1986 to 1988, much of it in those states, and half of that came from individuals or firms known to be involved with <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> programs, according to an internal agency report released in April. `` I was told we did n't have to have a license,'' <PERSON> Vasilios </PERSON> <PERSON> Damavolites </PERSON>, FOOD's treasurer, said in an interview from <LOCATION> Novi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, where the organization is headquartered. <PERSON> Damavolites </PERSON>, who is president of <ORGANIZATION> Dial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and goes by the anglicized name of <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Damas </PERSON>, said contributions have been difficult to raise since the release of a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> report that touched on the organization and its links to former agency official <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>. `` We do n't want to operate illegally,'' <PERSON> Damas </PERSON> said. `` We're not going to do anything else until we receive the proper license.'' Despite lacking appropriate state registration, FOOD holds federal tax exempt status from the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, meaning that donations are tax deductible. <PERSON> Damas </PERSON> said information about state licenses is kept by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Pretorius </PERSON>, who runs FOOD's relief operations from his home in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pretorius </PERSON> could not be reached for comment. His secretary in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> said Tuesday that <PERSON> Pretorius </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>, were attending an evangelical conference in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. FOOD for <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was an obscure relief organization delivering food and clothing to war refugees in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> until the release of a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> audit in April. The report probed possible connections between donations to FOOD by real estate developers and contracts awarded under <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s Moderate Rehabilitation program. The <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> rehabilitation program, which gave rent subsidies to developers to renovate housing for low-income residents, was suspended after the audit's release because of charges of favoritism in the awarding of contracts. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said Tuesday he had instituted new controls and restarted the program. <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>'s links to FOOD date to 1985, when he helped establish the charity. He quit his position as director after he moved to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> as assistant secretary for housing, according to the report. The report said <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> continued to work for the charity, attending at least eight fund-raisers in the 20 months after he became assistant secretary. A check of <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>'s phone logs, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, revealed that <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> often spoke to FOOD officials during working hours. After the investigation, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Inspector General <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> concluded that <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> may have violated the department's standards of conduct, which prohibit employees from directly or indirectly soliciting anything of value from anyone with `` interests that may substantially be affected'' by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> says the conclusions were based on circumstantial evidence, and says he never asked for contributions from any <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> developer. FOOD for <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> at one time held a license to solicit contributions in its home state of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, but allowed it to lapse in September 1987, according to documents obtained from the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> attorney general. A reapplication made this year has been delayed until FOOD can provide notarized signatures of two officers, the documents show. Yet FOOD held two fund-raisers in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> in 1988 and 1989, the organization's treasurer said in a telephone interview this week. FOOD also held at least 10 fundraising events in six other states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> in 1987 and 1988, according to the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> audit. FOOD also filed papers with the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> attorney general in June saying that it had `` pending applications in other states'' for licenses, although <PERSON> Damas </PERSON> said he did not know which states.

<HEAD>Congress Urged to Toughen Regulations on Kids' TV</HEAD>

 Television is sending one message to the nation's most impressionable viewers, says a senator _ `` buy, buy, buy.'' Witnesses urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> at a hearing Wednesday to restore restrictions on children's TV programs and join other nations that use television to enlighten rather than exploit the young. They said that since 1984, when the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> weakened time limits on advertising for children's shows, the only messages American kids have been getting from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> broadcasters are sales pitches. The barbs at the broadcast industry came at a hearing by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on communications on two bills that would restore the restrictions and give the federal government new authority over children's fare. `` Instead of inspiring children to learn, broadcasters are pushing them to buy, buy, buy,'' Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, an author of one of the bills, testified. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> said commercials in children's shows have increased since 1984 and some programs urge young viewers to dial 900 telephone numbers to hear taped messages from cartoon characters. Unsuspecting parents then get hit with huge telephone bills. Dr. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palumbo </PERSON>, representing the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pediatrics </ORGANIZATION>, contrasted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television with <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, where up to six hours of instructional programming for children is offered each day. `` In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, our commercial networks may offer one hour each week,'' <PERSON> Palumbo </PERSON> said. He did not include figures for public television stations. Sen. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>, D-Colo., _ who is sponsoring a bill that goes further than <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>'s _ testified that in the wake of the `` deregulation frenzy'' of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years, `` broadcasters seem to have abandoned educational children's programs altogether. He said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must pressure broadcasters to `` transform children's television from a ` vast wasteland' to a source of intellectual stimulation and enrichment for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> children.'' <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>'s bill includes provisions to: _ Impose tougher limits on advertising time in children's TV shows Currently, those limits are 9.5 minutes of commercials per hour on weekends and 12 minutes per hour during weekdays. _ Require TV stations, as part of the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> license renewal process, to show they are providing programming `` specifically designed to serve the educational and informational needs of preschool and school-aged children. _ Require broadcasters to give advance public notice of programs designed specifically to educate and inform children The bill by <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, is identical to a measure that passed <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year, only to be pocket-vetoed by President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. A similar measure is before the House. The <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> bill would hold commercials on children's shows to 10.5 minutes per hour weekends and 12 minutes weekdays, and require stations to demonstrate to the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> they are serving the educational and information needs of children through their `` overall programming.'' <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fritts </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION>, said his group supported the <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> bill, which he called a `` fair and reasonable compromise.'' He complained that broadcasters are losing young audiences to cable TV and VCRs, while production costs for children's shows are increasing. `` Further restrictions and more stringent programming requirements run the risk of knocking the children's television marketplace even further out of balance,'' <PERSON> Fritts </PERSON> told the subcommittee. <PERSON> DeWitt </PERSON> <PERSON> Helm </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertisers </ORGANIZATION>, opposed both bills. He called the restrictions unconstitutional and said they do n't protect children. Helm said there was no evidence children are any more susceptible to five minutes of commercials than to 15 minutes of ads.

 If you call the Hyatt Regency in suburban <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, this weekend and ask for <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, expect exasperation. There will be about 50 <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Smiths </PERSON> registered. They're members of the <ORGANIZATION> Jim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. They'll be attending its annual summer get-together, reveling in what they have in common _ a name. They're only a fraction of the <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Smiths </PERSON> who belong to the society. Its membership numbers 1,502, from virtually every state and many other countries. And the 1,502 are just the tip of the <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> iceberg. No one knows how many <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Smiths </PERSON> there are _ the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> keeps this sort of information confidential _ but the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> counts more than 16,000 on its roles. The <ORGANIZATION> Jim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> is the brainchild of _ this will come as no surprise _ a gent named <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. A good-natured <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 68, of <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, retired public relations man, he is the self-described `` founder-president-newsletter editor-chief bankroller.'' He established it 20 years ago. No goals for this society, no high purpose, except to exist and count noses. `` My membership application includes a line in which I ask applicants to list their most significant achievement,'' founder <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> recalls. `` One <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> responded by writing: ` Living up to the name by being completely undistinguished.''' No <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> has ever occupied the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> concedes. There once was a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. A handful of congressmen, a couple of governors went by that name, history shows. But ask him to come up with really famous <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Smiths </PERSON> and he wo n't bowl you over Currently, he'll list the secretary of state of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, a Republican who used to be a Democrat; a state senator in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, and the commissioner of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> highway patrol. That's about it for the <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> Hall of Fame. But the <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Smiths </PERSON> have fun when they get together. Everybody enjoys the annual softball game _ except maybe the scorekeeper. Most valuable player: <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. Winning pitcher: <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. Losing pitcher: <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. In the bullpen: <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. `` We've had instances when someone inadvertently calls out, ` Hey, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>!''' recalls Camp <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>, `` and 50 heads turn.'' Somewhere in the club's past, it lost its purity. It began admitting people like <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. It started with <PERSON> Timmy </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, son of member in good standing <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> from somewhere in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, founder <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> recalls. <PERSON> Timmy </PERSON> used to love coming with his dad to the summer festivals but hated it when he had to stand by the sidelines while they took the class picture.

Another <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, this one a former <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> colonel from <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, designed the society T-shirt.

<HEAD>Congress Tackles Spending, Deficit-Cutting Bills</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is speeding up work on an assortment of deficit-cutting and spending bills with the start of the 1990 fiscal year looming closer. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed the second of 13 annual appropriations Wednesday, an $ 11 billion measure for the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and cultural programs, on a 374-49 vote. The Senate has yet to approve any appropriations measures, which provide money for federal agencies. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> gave preliminary voice vote approval to a measure raising $ 5.3 billion in new tax receipts, mainly by boosting a series of levies on businesses. The panel rejected 22-11 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s pet tax proposal _ a cut in the capital gains tax that Democrats say benefits only the rich. But a deficit-slashing measure ran into problems in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The legislation would raise $ 50 million by increasing fees the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> charges investors and another $ 300 million by boosting <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> fees imposed on utilities. It would also expand the Medicaid program an estimated $ 5 billion to $ 13 billion over five years. That brought objections from Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dannemeyer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Calif </LOCATION>., who called the measure an example of `` the insidious practice of how we expand the liberal welfare state. Lawmakers returned this week from their Fourth of July recess to eight weeks of work left until the Oct. 1 start of the next fiscal year. They take a four-week break in August. They must keep the federal deficit to the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law's limit of $ 100 billion for 1990, out of a $ 1.17 trillion budget, to prevent automatic, across-the-board cuts. Two House Appropriations subcommittees, meeting behind closed doors, tried to finish spending bills for transportation programs and for labor, health, and education initiatives. Across the Capitol, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> divided programs worth $ 658 billion among its 13 subcommittees, opening the way for those panels to begin writing their own versions of the spending bills. Members of the committee complained that last spring's budget deal between President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and congressional leaders would not allow increases for programs that need more money. `` I wish we could do better, but we could only cut the cake so many ways,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> voted 23-0 for a package that claims $ 2.8 billion in savings. Some $ 1.8 billion would come from a bookkeeping move _ shifting the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> `` off-budget'' so its losses do n't count towards federal red ink. Other claimed savings would come by shifting the date on which the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reimburses the government $ 330 million for workers compensation payments from fiscal 1991 into fiscal 1990. Another $ 700 million in savings would be realized by spreading federal civilian employees retirement payments over two years, instead of in one single check.

 Judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, fighting to save his seat on the federal bench in a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> impeachment trial, says his chances of winning are a long way from bright. `` The political reality is not good,'' the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> jurist said during a break in the impeachment trial Wednesday when reporters asked how he thinks he will come out in the long run. `` I think I'll get a fair hearing, but I understand politics in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> added. He expressed hope, however, that there will be a surge of grassroots support for him that could improve his chances. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, 52, the first black federal judge in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> history, is accused of plotting to receive a $ 150,000 bribe, lying to a jury that acquitted him of criminal charges in 1983, and improper disclosure of information obtained from a federal wiretap. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> is accused of plotting with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Borders </PERSON> to get the payoff in exchange for returning $ 845,000 in forfeited cash to two convicted racketeers and keeping the two out of prison. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> was impeached by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> a year ago and now is on trial in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. If convicted, he would be removed from the bench and deprived of his judicial salary of $ 89,500 a year. A panel of 12 senators is hearing evidence in the case and will report later to the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which will make the final decision. Panel members on Wednesday donned earphones to monitor tapes made by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> when undercover agent <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rico </PERSON> met twice in September 1981 in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> with Borders, a friend of <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rico </PERSON> _ a former agent called out of retirement for the assignment _ was posing as <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON>, one of two brothers in the restaurant business convicted of racketeering in connection with a <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> pension fund loan and sentenced by <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> to three years in prison. The real <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON>, who has since died, did not respond to overtures sent by Borders through a go-between, according to witnesses. On the tape, <PERSON> Rico </PERSON> arranged what he and Borders called a demonstration of Borders' influence over <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>. While Borders was in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> at a boxing match, <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> was to have dinner at the Hotel Fontainebleau in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> did have dinner at the hotel at the appointed time on Sept. 16, 1981. He denies it was on Borders' instructions. The following Saturday, however, <PERSON> Rico </PERSON> met Borders at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and is heard to say he is handing the attorney $ 25,000 in cash in what prosecutors call a down payment on the payoff. Borders did not discover that `` Romano'' was actually Rico until several weeks later when he was arrested pulling out of a suburban <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> parking lot with the undercover agent and a garment bag containing $ 125,000 in cash. He was subsequently convicted in the case and sent to prison. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> has said repeatedly that he had nothing to do with the bribery scheme and that Borders, a longtime friend, was `` a rainmaker'' who was playing on their friendship to squeeze defendants for money. House members acting as prosecutors at the trial questioned that theory Wednesday after an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent and a former <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> strike force prosecutor testified that they witnessed two meetings between Borders and <ORGANIZATION> Santo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trafficante </ORGANIZATION>, the late kingpin of organized crime in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>.

 This is not another one of those jokes about <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. It is about a museum filled with garbage. The <ORGANIZATION> Hackensack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meadowlands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s museum will feature windows, tires, bottles, paper cartons and toys once destined for landfills in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, which produces 26,000 tons of trash daily _ enough to fill nearby Giants Stadium to the top of the scoreboard every 2 -LCB- weeks. `` The fundamental purpose is educational. We want to show people that garbage does n't just disappear. That it's not just by magic,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, a spokesman for the center. The plans for the museum come at a time when communities across the nation are considering ways to recycle some of their trash. A third of the country's 6,000 dumps will close during in the next five years, driving up disposal costs. The exhibit, which will be permanent and will be operated by the <ORGANIZATION> Hackensack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meadowlands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, is under construction. An official dedication is planned for October. From the garbage-filled entry, visitors will move to viewing holes where mirrors show the trash producers themselves. There's a display showing something that wo n't decay _ a glass bottle. Another display will explain disposal options, such as making a compost pile at home or recycling motor oil. And computer games on trash are planned. `` The purpose is to show the public what is thrown away, what could be recycled, and what their responsibilities and concerns should be to reduce the waste,'' said <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>. Each American generates an average of 3.5 pounds of refuse a day, adding 160 million tons to the nation's trash pile each year. Only 10 percent is recycled; the federal government has set a goal of 25 percent in four years. `` We are trying to change habits that have been with us since man first walked upright. ... What society has done is to find a useless piece of land and fill it up, then find another piece of land,'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said. `` People still think you put it out on Tuesdays and Thursdays and, ` Poof!' it disappears.'' The development commission, created 20 years ago by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, is responsible for environmental education, overseeing garbage disposal has four northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> counties and managing surrounding wetlands. The solid waste museum is one of three planned for the new 7,000-square-foot exhibit area, being built mostly with money from the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, which funds the environment center. The other exhibits will show area history, and animals and plants found in the wetlands around the center. The $ 400,000 museum will be geared to children. About 1,200 students now visit the center each month. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Galli </PERSON>, the commission's director of environmental operations, said she hopes children could persuade their parents to cut down on what they throw away. For example, she said school lunches could be put in reusable plastic containers instead of paper and foil. `` We want people to see it as a fun and also a learning experience,'' she said during a recent tour of the half-finished exhibit. `` While each of us is part of the problem, each of us is part of the solution.'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said the exhibit is getting attention from foreign media, including Japanese television stations and an Irish radio station. `` I think people worldwide are beginning to come to grips with the garbage crisis,'' he said. `` A museum of trash has a lot of anthropological and archaeological interest.'' As visitors leave the exhibit, they'll see trash as art _ sculpture and wall hangings made out of garbage. `` We wanted to leave them with an upbeat feeling instead of depressed and overwhelmed,'' Ms. <PERSON> Galli </PERSON> said. `` They leave thinking, ` I can take control of this situation by my own actions.'''

<HEAD>Painkiller Ordered Removed From Marketplace</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A federal judge has ordered a prescription painkiller removed from the marketplace because it never was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The order was issued Monday by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hungate </PERSON> but was not immediately made public. The drug _ Esgic with Codeine _ has been distributed nationally by <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceuticals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> since 1986. It contains 50 milligrams of butalbital, 30 milligrams of codeine, 40 milligrams of caffeine and 325 milligrams of acetaminophen. It is described as an analgesic for coping with moderate to severe pain. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, the parent company in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, refused to answer any questions about the drug, saying the matter was in litigation. The company contended that the drug was generally recognized by experts as safe and therefore not a new drug requiring approval by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>. But the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> contended that it was not widely recognized as safe because there were no published studies on the drug or any similar product. <PERSON> Hungate </PERSON> noted that the company failed to cite any published studies to refute the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s argument, and he concluded that `` where there are no published studies, there can be no general recognition'' of a drug as safe. <PERSON> Hungate </PERSON>'s order suspends manufacture and distribution of the drug or any similar product unless the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approves of it. He gave the agency power to inspect Forest's facilities to ensure compliance. He also assessed unspecified costs of the case against the company.

<HEAD>Capital Gains Tax Cut Left Out of Deficit-Reduction Plan _ For Now</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: May stand</HEAD>

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposed cut in the capital gains tax is still alive, but the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is refusing for now to make it part of a deficit-reduction package. The committee, after giving tentative approval to a $ 5.3 billion revenue increase, is putting finishing touches on the package. Aides say the subject of capital gains likely will be raised again before the final vote, as will an attempt to defer a new tax that finances catastrophic health insurance. The revenue-increase plan, a mishmash of mostly technical changes affecting corporations, was approved by voice vote in a closed-door session Wednesday after the committee, by a 22-11 margin, rejected <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call for a capital gains cut. Another voice vote eliminated a proposed one-year extension of the 3 percent tax on telephone service, which is due to expire Dec. 31, 1990. Still left in the bill are increases in taxes on snuff and chewing and pipe tobacco; imposition of income tax withholding on some farm workers who now are exempt; a one-year extension of the 8 percent airline ticket tax and the 5 percent levy on air freight, and imposing Social Security taxes on some deferred compensation. Tentatively approved but still subject to change are the biggest revenue-raisers in the bill: repeal of special dividend and interest deductions benefiting lenders and employers for investments in employee stock-ownership plans. Those changes would bring in more than $ 1.6 billion of the $ 5.3 billion of revenue increases that the committee is under orders to raise for deficit reduction in the budget year that begins Oct. 1. The committee attached a provision wiping out most of the disputed parts of a 1986 law, known as Section 89, that requires employers to use complex tests to prove their employee health-care plans are not weighted in favor of higher-paid workers. Under the committee's action, no Section 89 provisions would be enforced before Jan. 1. After that date, any employer-paid health plan would be acceptable if made available to 90 percent of employees and the employer paid at least half the premium. The health premium charged a worker earning under $ 20,000 a year could not exceed $ 1,000 for a policy covering only the employee and $ 2,000 for a policy covering a family. Small businesses would get an additional break. The health insurance provided by an employer with fewer than 20 workers would pass federal muster as long as the company gave coverage to all workers and contributed the same premium for all. Section 89 was enacted to encourage expansion of health coverage to more workers. The committee proposal, similar to changes approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, does not repeal anti-discrimination requirements; they simply free employers from complex tests to prove their plans are fair. Most of the votes against the cut in capital gains taxes, which apply to profits from the sale of stock and other assets, were cast by Democrats. They are wary of voting a capital gains cut because almost all the benefits go to upper-income people. However, aides working for members of both parties say there is a chance Democrats might change their minds if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> offers to support other tax changes that they favor. The administration proposed the capital gains tax cut as a way to raise revenue. Although there is general agreement that such a reduction would boost revenues during the first year, by encouraging investors to sell some long-held assets, congressional economists insist a cut would lose money later.

 A congressman outraged over artworks depicting explicit sexuality and religious desecration says the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to strip $ 45,000 from the federal arts budget is `` a slap on the wrist. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved the cut in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> budget after attempts to first take away all the agency's money and then reduce its budget by 10 percent failed. `` I'm afraid the long and the short of it is that they will get a message they can get away with anything and take nothing but a modest slap on the wrist,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Armey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>. The action Wednesday came as an amendment to the $ 11 billion <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> appropriations bill, which was eventually approved by a 374-49 vote. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has not voted on the Interior appropriation. The fight over arts funding, heightened by recent controversial exhibits that had federal money behind them, was debated for five hours before the amendment trimming the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION>'s budget was approved 361-65. The bill earmarked $ 144.2 million for the endowment, which provides grants to artists, writers and art exhibitors. `` We were concerned about the way the endowment was moving on certain taxpayer-funded projects,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stenholm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, who proposed the funding cut. <PERSON> Stenholm </PERSON>'s amendment was an alternative to one offered by Rep. <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohrabacher </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Calif </LOCATION>., that would have wiped out the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION>'s entire appropriation, and another by <PERSON> Armey </PERSON> that would have cut the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> budget by 10 <PERSON> Armey </PERSON> said the vote would do force the `` arrogant'' NEA to use `` standards of taste, decency, sensitivity, tolerance'' in its arts funding decisions. But <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Southern </PERSON>, acting endowment chairman, said the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> takes congressional concerns seriously. `` We shall continue to work with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to assure the integrity and effectiveness of the arts endowment processes and to maintain the independence of the peer review system and its affirmation of diverse aesthetic views and expressions,'' he said after the vote. The fight centered around a photograph by <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> of a plastic crucifix submerged in a container of the artist's urine, and an exhibition of photographs by the late <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON> that included depiction of homo-eroticism, child nudity and sadomasochism. The <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> gave the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contemporary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> $ 30,000 to display the <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON> works, and the <ORGANIZATION> Southeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contemporary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, $ 70,000 from which it awarded <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> a $ 15,000 prize. The Serrano award also included funds from the <ORGANIZATION> Equitable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Josh </PERSON> <PERSON> Dare </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION>. Congressional criticism grew after the <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON> photos were included in a catalogue for an exhibit at the <ORGANIZATION> Corcoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gallery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>. The gallery withdrew <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON>'s work from the exhibition. <PERSON> Stenholm </PERSON> said most of the public is not aware of these works, but `` my district would be overwhelmingly opposed to them,'' he said. `` They are in such poor taste.''

 FOOD for <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, a pet charity of a former top official at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, has raised thousands of dollars without proper registration in several states, according to records. A check by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> of the offices of state attorneys general and other agencies regulating charities found FOOD is not registered in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> or its home state of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. The organization raised at least $ 580,000 from 1986 to 1988, much of it in those states, and half of that came from individuals or firms known to be involved with <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> programs, according to an internal agency report released in April. `` I was told we did n't have to have a license,'' <PERSON> Vasilios </PERSON> <PERSON> Damavolites </PERSON>, FOOD's treasurer, said in an interview from <LOCATION> Novi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, where the organization is headquartered. <PERSON> Damavolites </PERSON>, who is president of <ORGANIZATION> Dial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and goes by the anglicized name of <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Damas </PERSON>, said contributions have been difficult to raise since the release of a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> report that touched on the organization and its links to former agency official <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>. `` We do n't want to operate illegally,'' <PERSON> Damas </PERSON> said. `` We're not going to do anything else until we receive the proper license.'' Despite lacking appropriate state registration, FOOD holds federal tax exempt status from the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, meaning that donations are tax deductible. <PERSON> Damas </PERSON> said information about state licenses is kept by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Pretorius </PERSON>, who runs FOOD's relief operations from his home in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pretorius </PERSON> could not be reached for comment. His secretary in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> said Tuesday that <PERSON> Pretorius </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>, were attending an evangelical conference in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. FOOD for <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was an obscure relief organization delivering food and clothing to war refugees in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> until the release of a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> audit in April. The report probed possible connections between donations to FOOD by real estate developers and contracts awarded under <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s Moderate Rehabilitation program. The <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> rehabilitation program, which gave rent subsidies to developers to renovate housing for low-income residents, was suspended after the audit's release because of charges of favoritism in the awarding of contracts. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said Tuesday he had instituted new controls and restarted the program. <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>'s links to FOOD date to 1985, when he helped establish the charity. He quit his position as director after he moved to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> as assistant secretary for housing, according to the report. The report said <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> continued to work for the charity, attending at least eight fund-raisers in the 20 months after he became assistant secretary. A check of <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>'s phone logs, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, revealed that <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> often spoke to FOOD officials during working hours. After the investigation, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Inspector General <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> concluded that <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> may have violated the department's standards of conduct, which prohibit employees from directly or indirectly soliciting anything of value from anyone with `` interests that may substantially be affected'' by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> says the conclusions were based on circumstantial evidence, and says he never asked for contributions from any <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> developer. FOOD for <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> at one time held a license to solicit contributions in its home state of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, but allowed it to lapse in September 1987, according to documents obtained from the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> attorney general. A reapplication made this year has been delayed until FOOD can provide notarized signatures of two officers, the documents show. Yet FOOD held two fund-raisers in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> in 1988 and 1989, the organization's treasurer said in a telephone interview this week. FOOD also held at least 10 fundraising events in six other states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> in 1987 and 1988, according to the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> audit. FOOD also filed papers with the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> attorney general in June saying that it had `` pending applications in other states'' for licenses, although <PERSON> Damas </PERSON> said he did not know which states.

<TEXT>
 A senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official says there have been some unspecified contacts between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its longtime enemy, the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said Wednesday it would be an `` exaggeration'' to say an official dialogue between the two sides is taking place. But he added there is `` classified reporting about contacts'' between the two sides that he would discuss only in a closed-door session. Israeli officials vehemently denied any contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s statement came in an appearance before a congressional panel in which he also said hard-liners in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> are damaging prospects for elections in the occupied territories. He denied Israeli radio reports that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is trying to interfere in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s affairs. Asked about the six-month-old diplomatic talks between the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said they have yielded no tangible results and that the talks would n't go on forever. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, spokesman for Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Naveh </PERSON>, spokesman for Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> denied to Israeli radio that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had had contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` There are no, and there will be no, contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Naveh </PERSON> was quoted as saying. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> also was asked about <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> comments on last week's attack on an Israeli bus in which 14 civilians were killed. He said <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> was instructed last week to `` bring up short'' <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman who labeled the attack a legitimate part of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> resistance efforts. <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday he regretted the loss of life and denied any <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> involvement. `` It is painful for me to witness the loss of all these civilian lives,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said in the interview. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, testifying before the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, denied that next week's high-level <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> mission to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was aimed at persuading the parties in the coalition government to stay together. He said the delegation, whose participants and schedule were not yet final, would discuss future prospects for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., the subcommittee chairman, noted news reports that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration was signaling <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders that it hopes the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will not leave the coalition government, and <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said it was `` rather extraordinary for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to inject itself into domestic politics. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said he was `` a little distressed at that interpretation of the trip,'' which he said is only for the purpose of having `` a healthy exchange'' about prospects for peace. `` It is not up to us to try to stage-manage domestic politics in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. ... We're not going to have a public position on an issue like that.'' He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still regards <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> policy as supporting the concept of elections among the 1.7 million Palestinians under <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. That is `` the operative and legally binding basis for the Israeli government to proceed,'' he said. Limits that hard-liners imposed on the election proposal at a <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference last week `` did not advance the process,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. `` If they became government policy ... that would make it more difficult. But we do not believe the final act has been played.''

<HEAD>US Team Calls for Safeguards for Soviets Sent to Mental Hospitals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is still hospitalizing citizens who are not mentally ill, says a team of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> health experts who recommend additional reforms to prevent confinement of political dissidents. The 26-member delegation's report, released Wednesday, said broad concepts of `` social dangerousness'' have contributed to the Soviet practice of hospitalizing people who are not mentally ill. In response, the Soviet side expressed disagreement with some aspects of the study but nonetheless called it a `` valuable and useful document.'' The delegation visited the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> from Feb. 26 to March 12 to assess recent changes in Soviet psychiatry. They examined 15 patients and 12 former patients who had been released within the preceding two years. Among the 12, `` the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team found no evidence of any past or current mental disorder in nine, and the remaining three had relatively mild symptoms that would not typically warrant involuntary hospitalization,'' said delegation member <PERSON> Darrel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regier </PERSON>, director of clinical research at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. The delegation's report said it `` recommends that additional steps be taken to revise the Soviet Criminal Codes to remove all prohibitions against expression of political or religious beliefs.'' In addition, the report said new legislation or regulations appear necessary to limit involuntary hospitalizations solely to those who are a direct danger to themselves or others. The report also recommended increased use of defense lawyers to guard against abuse of patients, and the use of periodic reviews to ensure that hospital stays are not excessively long. According to the report, the Soviet hosts generally complied with the terms of the agreement under which the visit was made although there were some `` significant procedural obstacles'' that made completing the task more difficult. The preliminary Soviet response to the report acknowledged the existence of such obstacles but said the problem `` by no means meant that the Soviet specialists artificially created difficulties and tried to limit access to the necessary information on the patients.'' The Soviet response said efforts are being made to bring Soviet laws into conformity with international standards. In addition, it said, there has been discussion of the creation of an independent commission `` to examine any and all complaints of wrongful acts by employees of the psychiatric service, and for public monitoring of the activity of psychiatric institutions.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team made the visit against a background of allegations about misuse of psychiatric treatment in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. One report cited 346 cases of alleged psychiatric abuse between 1977 and 1983. The perception that the problem was rampant prompted the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to condemn <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1977 for the alleged practices. Faced with expulsion from the group, the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> All-Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Neuropathologists </ORGANIZATION> and Psychiatrists resigned from the WPA in 1983. But the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> delegation acknowledged there has been progress in recent years toward establishing some legal protection for patients subject to forced confinement.

 A division of the <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> wo n't be allowed to do business with the government because of alleged fraud connected to two weapons systems the division worked on. Precision Product Division of <LOCATION> Norwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, was suspended temporarily because of criminal charges brought last spring over the division's work on the flight data transmitter for the air-launched cruise missile and a stabilization system for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s AV-8B Harrier jet, <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. The suspension is temporary pending completion of the legal proceedings, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> letter informing <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> of the suspension. The letter, obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, said the indictment returned in the federal court in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> alleged <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> and others `` conspired to defraud the government by knowingly supplying untested and out-of-specification flight stabilization and control packages and making false, fictitious and fraudulent statements and representations'' regarding the cruise missile and the Harrier jet. The suspension involves only future business at Precision Products, not contracts elsewhere at <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> or contracts at Precision on which work is now underway. The company said the division accounts for about 2 -LCB- percent of sales and less than 4 percent of its $ 5 billion order backlog. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> is a major defense contractor, building the new B-2 `` stealth'' bomber. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Loye </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> called the government's charges `` unwarranted and exaggerated,'' and the suspension `` unnecessary.'' `` The company intends to provide information in opposition to the government's temporary suspension of the unit,'' the statement said. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>'s statement said the company has taken `` strong actions'' to assure that it is a responsible contractor, including the closure of a facility in <LOCATION> Pomona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and the dismissal of several employees.

<TEXT>
 Leaders of the world's seven major industrial democracies gather in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on Friday for their 15th annual economic summit, surrounded by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s bicentennial hoopla and with a comfortable sense of economic self-satisfaction. The oil crises, inflationary pressures, monetary instability and other woes that dominated previous summits seem contained, giving the government leaders time to take an unhurried look at matters such as the environment and Third World debt. The surge in the dollar that started in June, sending economic shivers down the backs of many a government official, has been cooled after massive intervention by central banks selling dollars. An optimistic <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> emphasized the Western economies are doing well and the coordination process among the seven _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> _ is working. There is no need for tinkering during the three-day summit beginning Friday, he said. `` The summit is taking place in a period of growth,'' noted <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Attali </PERSON>, a special adviser to French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>. `` The discussions will be on how to manage this growth.'' Lack of an immediate economic crisis is good news for debtor nations and the Third World in general. While debt is not a new subject for the seven, this year it will be the `` priority of priorities,'' according to <PERSON> Attali </PERSON>. Both <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> are pushing plans that involve forgiving part of Third World debts in exchange for guarantees that the rest will be paid. Nobody opposes the idea, but there are differences over where to find the money to finance the plan. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> long has cast himself as the champion of the poor, underdeveloped and indebted. He hopes the summit will end with a `` <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> plan'' for debt reduction. In May, he announced <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> will forgive 16 billion francs, the equivalent of about $ 2.5 billion, in public debt owed by <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 35 poorest countries. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recently said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will forgive about $ 1 billion in debt owed by 16 sub-Saharan African nations starting Oct. 1. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, making his first outing at a `` Big 7'' summit, on Monday proposed a $ 100 million American aid package to help private entrepreneurs in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, coupled with debt relief and new loans. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he will be seeking similar funds from the other participants at the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> summit. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced an aid package for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, which includes plans to ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for $ 25 million in new aid to spur that country's moves toward a free-market economy. The French expect <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to make a major debt initiative at the summit. Not everybody is enchanted with the idea of holding the summit of the world's richest countries at the same time as the celebration of the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution that overthrew the monarchy. Some believe the bicentennial celebrations ignore today's politically and economically oppressed Thousands of people demonstrated and tens of thousands attended a protest concert Saturday organized by the French singer <PERSON> Renaud </PERSON>. Leaders of 31 countries are to attend the bicentennial celebrations, which include a series of lunches, dinners, ceremonies, parades and receptions. As is usual with these summits, politics will be the first item on the menu. French officials stress that the seven leaders will talk about anything that interests them, but that it is virtually certain that the situation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> will be at the top of the political list, along with the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and terrorism. A joint political statement probably will be issued in addition to a final communique. The themes for the summit are the classic ones: economic and monetary cooperation, trade, protectionism and development. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> also wants a discussion on the laundering of drug money. But the new topic, and the one being emphasized here after the question of debt, is the environment. The French, in particular, want to get into detail on air and water pollution and action that can be taken in cases such as the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil spill.

 Doctors said he would never smile and would be lucky to live more than a few weeks, but a boy born without a brain is now 5 years old and laughs at <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION> programs, says his adoptive mother. `` <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> just glows,'' said <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vandal </PERSON>. `` He laughs, he giggles, he smiles. He has an outgoing, bubbly personality that really draws people to him.'' Doctors `` said he would never smile, never respond, never grow,'' Ms. <PERSON> Vandal </PERSON> said. `` All those things have proved to be untrue.'' <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, who celebrated his 5th birthday Wednesday, is in excellent health, said Ms. <PERSON> Vandal </PERSON>, a pediatric nurse who lives in <LOCATION> Wallingford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` He had not even had a cold until this past year when he developed the flu,'' she said in a telephone interview. `` But he got over it in normal fashion and went back to nursery school.'' Soon after <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION>, doctors ran tests that showed he had no brain. A cyst had formed at the stem of the brain and kept the rest of it from forming, leaving his skull filled with fluid _ a condition known as hydranencephaly. He survived because the brain stem contains the nerve center that controls breathing and circulation. The parts of the brain that allow humans to think and coordinate muscular movement _ the cerebrum and cerebellum _ never formed. Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leshner </PERSON>, a professor of neurology and pediatrics at the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>, said there is no known treatment for hydranencephaly and that the prognosis for such patients is poor. Most children with the condition `` do n't make it past the first year of life,'' he said. The cause of the condition is not known. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>'s biological mother had decided before his birth that she would give up her child for adoption. Foster parents took care of the boy for five months while the Richmond-based <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>, a private adoption agency, searched for prospective parents. `` <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> was the hardest adoption I ever did,'' said <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, the society's director of development. `` We decided we're not putting this kid in an institution We're going to place him.'' Ms. <PERSON> Vandal </PERSON> sought to adopt <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> after reading a newspaper story about him. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, who is 3 feet tall, weighs 32 pounds and has golden, curly hair and blue eyes, will start his third year of nursery school in the fall, Ms. <PERSON> Vandal </PERSON> said. `` Other children treat him wonderfully. He participates in all activities other children do, and is very much a part of everything,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Vandal </PERSON> has two girls with conditions similar to <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>'s. One is 12 years old, the other 3. She said all three will never walk or be able to sit or stand unsupported. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> `` is constantly on the move,'' she said. `` He lies on the floor on his back and kicks around the floor. As soon as we open the sliding glass door, he heads right out the door and onto the porch.'' <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> can not speak and is cortically blind, which means images are being seen but not interpreted. Still, said Ms. <PERSON> Vandal </PERSON>, `` he laughs when he watches the <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION> on TV.'' Ms. <PERSON> Vandal </PERSON>, a single parent, lives with her parents. They help care for the children. `` We let him do what he wants to do,'' she said. `` The more he does, the more he gains. I'm not sure how long that will go on, but it has n't stopped yet. We're giving him the best quality of life for however long he lives.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> says its safety record is `` second to none,'' even though its submarines have been involved at least 42 collisions with other vessels since 1983. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Cmdr. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said Wednesday that the number includes 15 incidents with other <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vessels and work boats, including minor collisions with the tugboats that help a sub enter a harbor. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was commenting on a report in the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Press-Telegram </ORGANIZATION> over the weekend that said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> documents revealed that the service's submarines have been involved at least 42 collisions with other vessels, including five fishing boats, since 1983. In the most serious incident, the attack submarine USS <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> snagged a towing cable of the commercial tugboat Barcona off <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> last month. The tug was sunk and one member of the three-man crew drowned. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has that case under investigation. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the Barcona fatality `` is the only one that we know of.'' The spokesman said a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> study of collisions involving submarines from 1983 to 1987 found that five collisions had occurred with other submarines, one with a destroyer and one with a rescue salvage ship.

<NOTE>Senate Panel Approves Health Insurance Bill</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee has approved a measure by Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> to require <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> employers to provide health insurance to all their workers and their workers' dependents. The measure cleared <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on a 9-7 party-line vote Wednesday. But it's strongly opposed by the administration and other powerful groups, including many business organizations. The Kennedy bill is intended to provide coverage for the estimated 37 million Americans not now covered by any public or private health insurance. Although many of the details have been reworked, the bill is similar to one that cleared the committee last year but was not considered in either the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> or House. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> noted that the majority of businesses already insure their workers, `` yet two-thirds of all the Americans who lack basic health insurance protection are workers or members of working families.'' Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, argued against the measure in a letter to <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, saying enactment of his bill `` would result in a significant loss of job opportunities, impair our nation's economic competitiveness, and interfere with the right of employees and employers to determine between themselves the most appropriate compensation package to meet their circumstances.''

<NOTE>Cable Association Says Baseball Growing on Local TV, Too</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Local television stations, not just cable TV networks, are increasing the number of Major League baseball games they carry, a cable TV group says. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday disputed claims that cable companies are stealing baseball from `` free TV.'' Local broadcast coverage of professional baseball has grown by nearly 40 percent over the past 15 years, from 1,190 games in 1975 to 1,647 games in 1989, the association said. The number of baseball games televised by both local broadcast stations and by regional cable sports networks has increased 7 percent since 1985, the <ORGANIZATION> NCTA </ORGANIZATION> said. `` As a result, cable's baseball coverage has served to supplement, rather than reduce, the number of games aired by local broadcasters,'' the cable association said in a report, `` Availability of Baseball Games on Broadcast and Cable Television.'' It said some broadcasters have contended that baseball on cable has reduced the number of games carried by local television stations.

<TEXT>
 National Guardsmen have joined police in their battle against violent, drug-dealing gangs from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> that have wreaked havoc on <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>'s north side. Mayor <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and state officials said Wednesday the first of 36 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardsmen </ORGANIZATION> reported to work late last week with the <ORGANIZATION> Portland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>. The rest will join the ranks by the end of this week and eight others will be on call, said the guard's director, Gen. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Rees </PERSON>. The guardsmen will fill support roles, acting as <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> interpreters, taking telephone tips and doing paperwork. That will enable police to deploy more officers on the streets. <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> is beset by gang violence, with five killings blamed on drive-by gang shootings since August. There have been about four dozen gang-related shootings this year, including one Tuesday night that seriously wounded a 13-year-old boy. `` It's clearly a problem,'' said <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kantor </PERSON>, Governor <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldschmidt </PERSON>'s spokesman. `` It's not as big as <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' gang problem, but it is very serious for us and one we do n't intend to tolerate.'' Officials have not decided how long the guardsmen will remain in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, but the effort has federal financing through October. `` It's just one more increment, one more step,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the governor's anti-crime coordinator, said at a news conference. `` The gang problem is bigger than this; the narcotics problem is bigger than this.'' Drive-by gang shootings were unheard of in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> until last summer, when the rival drug-dealing Crips and Bloods gangs began expanding from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> and other cities. Turf battles ensued and the region's first fatal drive-by gang shooting occurred last Aug. 17. `` We're not going to walk away from this saying 36 or 40 troops is enough until we have gotten rid of the drug problem in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and specifically in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> Deputy Chief <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Noelle </PERSON> said the guardsmen will free up more officers for street deployments. `` In terms of looking at raw numbers, it's not a big deal,'' <PERSON> Noelle </PERSON> said, but in terms of support work, `` it's a real asset.'' The state received $ 474,000 from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> to use the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to fight crime. About half that money will be used to pay troops in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> through Sept. 30, <PERSON> Rees </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> specifically said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> could be used only for support when it passed an act giving states $ 300 million for anti-drug efforts, <PERSON> Rees </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> is not supposed to be in the arrest or seizure business,'' he said.

 A grand jury indicted 13 people on charges they conspired to defraud a federally subsidized housing program that was designed to help low-income residents become homeowners. The indictments, which followed a two-year investigation of a <ORGANIZATION> Brookhaven </ORGANIZATION> program called Save-a-House, were handed up Wednesday. Two of the 13 charged are former law enforcement officers. `` We're talking about people that would steal the pennies off a dead man's eyes,'' said <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>. The charges come at a time of numerous reports of fraud, corruption and influence-peddling in similar programs funded by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> and Urban Development across the country. Under the Save-a-House program, 18 houses were designated to be sold to low-income families for $ 500 each. The indictment alleges that 14 of these homes were fraudulently obtained for between $ 500 to $ 5,000 by people representing themselves as eligible recipients under the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> guidelines. `` These people are devoid of any conscience,'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> said. `` The sad part is that they deprived deserving families of a roof over their heads.'' A source close to the investigation who spoke on condition of anonymity said that the investigation was proceeding into all housing programs in <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> that received federal funds during the past eight years. More indictments are expected, the source said. All of the people who allegedly bought the houses fraudulently were either close friends or relatives of three of the defendants: <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brazier </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Westhampton </LOCATION>, a former <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> agent; <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Iannuzzi </PERSON>, 45, of <LOCATION> Smithtown </LOCATION>, a former <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> police officer; and <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Story </PERSON>, 50, of <LOCATION> Bellport </LOCATION>. They were charged with grand larceny. The three defendants still control the houses through their real estate companies and rented out the houses for an average of $ 800 a month, in some cases to people whose rent is subsidized by welfare. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON>, defense attorney for <PERSON> Brazier </PERSON> and <PERSON> Iannuzzi </PERSON>, said the charges were part of a vendetta against his clients. `` They did n't do anything illegal, or criminal,'' <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON> said. `` An opportunity was presented and they took advantage of an opportunity.'' The 13 each pleaded innocent at arraignments in <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION>. Some were released on their own recognizances. Others had bail set from between $ 5,000 to $ 25,000. Only one of the 13 was not a friend or relative of <LOCATION> Brazier </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Iannuzzi </PERSON>, or Story. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Spahr </PERSON>, the assistant district attorney who led the probe, said that investigators are still searching for the county employee who approved the applications for the houses.

<HEAD>Growth Hormone Speeds Wound Healing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An ointment that makes skin grow faster can speed up nature's healing process and could capture a substantial share of the billion dollar market for wound care products, researchers reported today. The experimental treatment is based on a natural substance called epidermal growth factor that is produced through gene splicing. In a report on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, doctors found that it could cut more than a day off the healing time of people undergoing skin grafts. `` It had always been taught in medical school that you could not stimulate wounds to heal faster,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who directed the study. `` We set out to show that you could.'' The hormone was produced for this experiment by <ORGANIZATION> Chiron </ORGANIZATION>, a biotechnology firm in <LOCATION> Emeryville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` To the best of our knowledge, no one has ever before made a claim for a prescription drug on the basis of its favorable effect on wound healing,'' according to an editorial in the journal. The editorial, by Drs. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. La Van of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said the latest research appears to be the long-awaited first carefully conducted study showing that the approach actually works. `` The annual market for products used in the care of wounds in this country is more than $ 1 billion, and a successful growth factor-based product would be expected to capture a substantial share of the market,'' they wrote. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and colleagues conducted the study on 12 people being treated for burns and broken legs at <LOCATION> Emory </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> universities. Each patient received separate applications of cream on side-by-side wounds where skin had been removed for grafts. One application contained the growth factor, the other did not. In every patient, the wound getting the hormone healed faster. The healing time varied from person to person, but on average the wounds getting the growth factor completely healed in about 11 days, while those without the treatment took 1 -LCB- days longer. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said that while the benefits of the treatment were minor for these people, the study was a necessary first step to demonstrate that the hormone actually spurs healing the way scientists had theorized. `` The important thing is to show efficacy and then to open different areas where is it clinically more important,'' he said. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> noted that the treatment could help save the lives of people who have extensive burns and little skin available for grafts. Doctors must repeatedly harvest skin from the same unburned area, allowing time for healing in between. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> also said he has used the treatment on two people with burns over 80 percent of their bodies. With the growth hormone, doctors were able to take skin from the same area five times, while ordinarily they would have only been able to do so three times. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the hormone also may heal chronic wounds, bed sores or diabetic ulcers. He speculated that someday it might even be sold over the counter to help clear up minor cuts and burns.

<TEXT>
 The authenticity of 19 Superman collages by <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> has been called into question by two comic book experts who say the Superman cut-outs did n't appear in print until years after the date on the artworks. `` Either they were misdated or somebody has made some work that is not what it purports to be,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> art dealer who owns 18 of the collages. The discrepancy was detected by comic book experts <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheinaus </PERSON> during independent visits to a Warhol retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which ran from Feb. 6 to May 2. <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Monday he was looking in the exhibition catalog at an untitled Superman collage, dated 1960-61, when he recognized the inking style of the artist who did the cartoon panel. `` I remembered that <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> did not start inking <PERSON> Superman </PERSON> until the late 1960s, maybe 1969. And I thought ` Hold it, something is wrong here!''' `` When I met Sheinaus a month later, he said, ` Did you notice anything funny about the <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> exhibition?''' <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> said. `` I looked him right in the eye and said ` One has got to be a fraud.' `` He said, ` You wo n't believe this but there are about 15 of them.''' The series of 19 collages has been estimated to be worth about $ 5 million. Each piece was signed twice and dated 1960-61. The <ORGANIZATION> DC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comics </ORGANIZATION> they came from _ like `` Superman's Greatest Blunder'' -LRB- 1968 -RRB- and `` <PERSON> Muto </PERSON> vs. the Man of Tomorrow'' -LRB- 1966 -RRB- _ sold for 12 cents each. Seven of the collages _ cut-outs from original comic books that were pasted on paper and splattered with red or blue paint _ were on display during the <ORGANIZATION> MOMA </ORGANIZATION> retrospective; six were loaned by <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, one by an unidentified private collector, said <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, a museum spokeswoman. In a statement, the museum said, `` Works of art are selected for exhibitions based on careful research and on the best information available at the time. `` In any retrospective of an artist there may be questions regarding dating; however, we have no reason whatsoever to doubt the authenticity of any of the works included in the <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> retrospective,'' it said. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, a lawyer for the <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> estate, said that the discrepancy in dating was being investigated but that a preliminary examination indicated the collages were authentic. However, <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Fremont </PERSON>, a director of the estate, told the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION>, which reported on the mismatch in dates on Monday, that he did n't recall seeing the collages during the'60s and'70s. `` I've worked with <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> since I was 18, and you did n't see them being bought and sold,'' he said. `` You see what I am saying?'' <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Malanga </PERSON>, who in 1963 became <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>'s first studio assistant, said he saw the collages for the first time at the exhibition. `` I was fascinated because I knew almost everything <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> was doing at that time, and I thought ` Why did n't I know about these things?''' He said that later when he learned about the discrepancy in dates, he doubted that the works were <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>'s. `` Those pieces require someone to sit down at a kitchen table with scissors and glue,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> would not have taken the time to do something like that.'' He also noted that during 1961-62, <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>'s comic book images were paintings not collages. <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> quit using comic book images after about 1962, when he learned <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichtenstein </PERSON> was also using them. <PERSON> Malanga </PERSON> also noted that <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> often had his assistants sign his works for him.

 The immensely unpopular chief of <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has been removed from the post, President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> announced, calling the move a critical step in the democratization of the ruling party The official, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Solovyov </PERSON>, was rejected by voters in March elections for the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> despite running unopposed. It was an embarrassing vote of no confidence; a majority of voters scratched his name off the ballot. The 60-year-old <PERSON> Solovyov </PERSON>, who had headed the country's second most powerful regional party organization, is also likely to lose his seat on the party's 20-member ruling Politburo. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had gone to <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> to oversee the leadership change and announced that <PERSON> Solvyov </PERSON> was being replaced by <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gidaspov </PERSON>, a 56-year-old industrial chemist credited with economic innovation. Voters in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, the country's second-largest city with 4.8 million residents, rejected virtually their entire party leadership in the historic spring elections for the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Solovyov </PERSON> has shared the blame with other <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> officials for pollution in the region and taking a hard line on dissent. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s decision Wednesday to retire <PERSON> Solovyov </PERSON> is a critical step in `` developing the process of democratization of the internal life of the entire party.'' In an extraordinary television interview that included both <PERSON> Solovyov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gidaspov </PERSON>, the Soviet leader said the decision to change leadership came in response to party dissatisfaction. The president, who had promoted <PERSON> Solovyov </PERSON> to the Politburo three years ago, said the party is lagging in its efforts to restructure the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` Many things are not being solved in the proper time, and this is due to the fact that the party itself does not act in time,'' he said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s statement followed several days of similar comments in the Soviet press, including the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda. After the March election defeat of 12 members of the <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> leadership, a poll found that 68 percent of the city's residents and 66 percent of its party members did `` not believe the current party leadership has the ability to radically change the situation in the city.'' <PERSON> Solovyov </PERSON>, seated next to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in the television interview, said the most important task he leaves for his successor is increasing the authority of the party on a democratic basis and `` eliminating its complacency.'' In April, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> sharply reprimanded <PERSON> Solovyov </PERSON> at a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> meeting for complaining that the party had lost its unity and was becoming `` a discussion club.'' <PERSON> Gidaspov </PERSON>, who was elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, has been touted as a leader in economic experimentation for his work as head of an enterprise that runs joint ventures of several industries without interference from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> ministries. In the television interview, <PERSON> Gidaspov </PERSON> promised to open discussion of the city's problems to a variety of groups, including environmentalists. He said 18th-century central <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, marked by crumbling pastel facades, should be restored.

<HEAD>Dollar Drops In Tokyo, Stocks Slip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar fell against the Japanese yen in quiet trading in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today, while stock prices slipped. The dollar closed at 139.05 yen, down 1.45 yen from its finish on Wednesday. After opening lower at 139.63 yen, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency ranged between 138.82 and 139.68 yen. Currency dealers said the market was quiet as players waited for the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic figures, including producer prices for June, retail sales and industrial production, all due out Friday. `` There was some profit-taking, causing the dollar's fall,'' said <PERSON> Masato </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanjo </PERSON>, a dealer in the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> office of Manufacturers' Hanover Trust. `` But I do n't expect any major movements in the market until the release of economic indicators tomorrow. Another dealer said a comment Wednesday by the governor of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> also encouraged the dollar-selling. <PERSON> Satoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON> reportedly told journalists that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency was still too strong against the yen. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, which shed 45.25 points Wednesday, lost another 70.36 points, or 0.20 percent, closing at 33,631.16. Securities dealers said the recent strong performance of overseas stock exchanges was encouraging investors on the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market, but the low volume of trading reflected investors' lack of interest and concern over continuing political uncertainties in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` The external environment is not too bad, but investors find it hard to particapate in trading as long as political uncertainties persist,'' said <PERSON> Ichitaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON>, a dealer for <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. The governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s majority in the upper house of the Diet, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s parliament, is widely seen in jeopardy in upcoming elections because of the party's involvement in scandals and a public uproar over an unpopular 3 percent consumption tax which began April 1. Volume traded on the first section of the exchange, which lists major issues, was estimated at 550 million shares, compared with Wednesday's 600 million shares.

<HEAD>Mentally Retarded Killers: One Spared Electric Chair, Second Awaits
Appeal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SONYA ROSS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A killer was spared the electric chair as state justices reviewed conflicting laws on executing mentally retarded people, while federal judges considered the same issue in the case of an <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> killer. The cases followed the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision two weeks ago that allows states to execute mentally retarded murderers as long as sentencing juries or judges have considered the defendant's mental condition. The <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> voted 4-3 Wednesday to delay the scheduled execution of <PERSON> Son </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>, who was sentenced to die for the 1976 slaying of a <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> police chief. The stay came Wednesday five hours before the 59-year-old <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> was to go to the electric chair. In the second case, attorneys for murderer-rapist <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkins </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> turned today to the 11th <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in a bid to halt his execution at 12:01 a.m. Friday in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. The lawyers claim <PERSON> Dunkins </PERSON> is mentally retarded. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District judge on Wednesday turned down the appeal. In the <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> case, a new <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> law bans executions of the mentally retarded but it does not apply retroactively. <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>'s death warrant runs for a week, and he could be executed at any time during that period if the court rules by then Court officials said the review could take several days. <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>'s IQ scores range from 64 to 72; a person with an IQ of 70 is considered mentally handicapped. `` The execution of the mentally retarded in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> is cruel and unusual punishment,'' said <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>. `` There should be no fine line between those who happen to be tried in 1989 and those who happen to be tried in 1976. That's an arbitrary distinction, happenstance that should not be applicable.'' On Tuesday, the Pardons and <ORGANIZATION> Paroles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> rejected <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>'s appeal for clemency Board chairman <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON> said the decision was made on grounds that <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> was aware of the consequences of his actions, no matter what his IQ. Snow said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision also was a factor in the board's decision. <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Rochelle </LOCATION>, was convicted along with <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> of killing <ORGANIZATION> Ray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Giddens </PERSON> in 1976. <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> was executed May 18. <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>'s nephew, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>, is serving a life sentence for murder in the case. <PERSON> Dunkins </PERSON>' attorneys, meanwhile, argued his execution should be halted on grounds that a jury did n't consider <PERSON> Dunkins </PERSON>' alleged mental deficiency during his 1981 trial. In court documents, <PERSON> Dunkins </PERSON>' IQ was listed at 69. In Wednesday's denial of a stay of execution, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> said that even if jurors did n't consider <PERSON> Dunkins </PERSON>' mental condition, the trial judge did The judge sentenced <PERSON> Dunkins </PERSON> to die in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s electric chair. <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> has no state law prohibiting the execution of the mentally retarded. A jury convicted <PERSON> Dunkins </PERSON> in May 1981 of capital murder in the rape and slaying of <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>, a 26-year-old mother of four from Warrior, <LOCATION> Ala </LOCATION>.

 Supreme Court Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said death penalty cases are `` a very severe burden on the judicial system'' and questioned whether executions deter crime. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, speaking Wednesday to the annual conference of the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, said states should consider the judicial burden when the issue of capital punishment arises. `` I would think from time to time, when legislators confront whether the capital sentencing, whole death-penalty business, is really worth the cost, one of the elements of the costs that ought to be factored into the equation is the very severe burden on the judicial system, both state and federal,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said. He cited the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s emergency hearings on requests for stays of execution. The hearings are often late at night. `` As the number of executions is continuing to increase ... one can raise the question whether they're really doing all that much to deter crime,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said. Asked afterward whether he thought the burdens of the death penalty on the legal system outweighed the benefits, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said, `` There is a serious question,'' and declined to comment further. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, a 1975 appointee of President Ford, has voted to allow some executions but dissented from the court's recent rulings that allowed states to execute 16-year-olds and mentally retarded adults. On another topic, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said the court was n't affected by the flood of letters before last week's abortion ruling. The only problem was `` sorting that stuff out and throwing it in the wastebasket, because nobody read any of it,'' said <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, who voted against the decision that gave states to more power to regulate abortions.

<HEAD>Beginnings of Ozone Loss Detected Over Arctic, Researchers Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scientists said today they have found a high-altitude deficit in ozone over the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION>, revealing what may be an early step toward periodic ozone depletions like those seen over <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>. Arctic depletions would be smaller than those forming the annual `` ozone hole'' over <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>, said D.J. <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyoming </ORGANIZATION> physicist and an author of the study published in the British journal Nature. But `` anytime man can perturb the natural ozone profile in any way I think we should be worried,'' he said. `` Then we're in a situation where we -LRB- can -RRB- better know ... exactly how we're doing it, so that we can correct it.'' Manmade chemicals such as chlorofluorocarbons are blamed for destroying ozone, a form of oxygen found high in the atmosphere. Ozone blocks ultraviolet rays that cause skin cancer, so scientists are concerned by signs of ozone loss. The Antarctic hole is an area in which up to 50 percent of atmospheric ozone disappears for a limited time. In the Arctic, perhaps 25 percent could disappear under highly unusual worst-case circumstances, said <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON>, who conducted the study with scientists from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION>. Previous studies also have suggested ozone depletions over the Arctic. The study does not prove that the observed deficit is an early step in ozone depletion, but it is very suggestive, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Friend </PERSON>, an atmospheric chemistry professor at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` I think they're probably right, but they have a lot of suppositions,'' Friend said. The new observations were made by balloon-borne instruments launched last January in northern <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. The instruments detected the apparent ozone deficit at altitudes between about 14 miles and 16 miles. The Antarctic ozone hole develops as such high-level deficits spread to lower altitudes, where most polar ozone is found, <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. But the Arctic atmosphere presents obstacles to that process, <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON> said. One is that a funnel-like wind pattern needed for the deficits to spread tends to break down in the Arctic, in contrast to its stability in the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION>. In fact, researchers reported, this pattern disintegrated soon after the high-altitude ozone deficit was discovered. Another barrier is that very low temperatures needed for destruction of ozone do not typically appear in the Arctic at lower altitudes where ozone is depleted in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON> said. But Arctic air is cold enough at higher altitudes, and if the crucial wind pattern remained stable, perhaps 25 percent of atmospheric ozone could be destroyed over an affected area, he said. That situation is highly unlikely, he said. The deficit, which appeared under conditions unusually favorable for ozone depletion, represents about a 3 percent decline, he said.

 Although it's said <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> may have felt his hometown was Death in the Afternoon, this <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb is planning a Moveable Feast to honor the writer on what would have been his 90th birthday. `` He was a failure as a person, but as a writer, he was the greatest,'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Buske </PERSON>, historian of <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hemingway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday in a telephone interview. `` He antagonized people. At his death he had few friends. He was a braggart, he was cruel. He was basically insecure.'' Then why honor such a person? `` Because he was the great writer,'' said <PERSON> Buske </PERSON>. `` It appears more and more that he was the best American writer of this century.'' <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> _ Nobel Prize-winning author of `` Death in the Afternoon,'' `` A Moveable Feast,'' `` The Sun Also Rises,'' `` For Whom the Bell Tolls,'' `` A Farewell to Arms'' and `` The Old Man and the Sea'' _ was born July 21, 1899, in <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> and lived here until he was 18. Every July, the foundation marks the occasion with a week of events. This year, a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> postage stamp with <PERSON> Papa </PERSON>'s portrait on it will be presented. `` The biggest thing is the stamp, which will appear first in Key West on July 17 and in <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> on July 21,'' said <PERSON> Buske </PERSON>. `` The Post Office announced they were issuing the stamp in <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> _ his home in later life _ and when we found about it, we raised such a fuss, they caved in and agreed to let us in on the event. It's unusual for a bureaucracy.'' On July 21, <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON>'s son <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> will speak at a ceremony at the <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> dedicating the stamp. The weeklong birthday tribute begins Friday with a Bastille Day street party at a restaurant. Also scheduled are: a Hemingway film festival introduced by another son, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>; tours of the two houses the writer-to-be lived in; a gourmet picnic at $ 40 a person with menu items from granddaughter <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>'s cookbook; and a family reunion of the burly writer's two sons and assorted nieces, nephews and in-laws. <PERSON> Buske </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parkers </ORGANIZATION> who do n't like <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> are quick to quote a line attributed to the bearded writer, that the suburb has `` broad lawns and narrow minds.'' But <PERSON> Buske </PERSON> said he has done extensive research and has never been able to confirm <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> ever said such a thing. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwar </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Hemingway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, said the quote `` gives the impression that he did n't like <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> and that is n't true. He had a normal, happy childhood, and he got a good education here. `` His family was active in community affairs and in photographing themselves. So we have plenty of photos,'' <PERSON> Schwar </PERSON> said. Although <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> only wrote short stories of his Chicago-area roots, <PERSON> Buske </PERSON> thinks the author, who committed suicide while gravely ill in 1961, actually was deeply influenced by the suburb's morality and hard-work ethic. `` He did n't feel right when he was n't following Oak Park traditions. Let's take sexual morality. He married the girls he went with. He was n't content just to sleep with them. `` The motto of <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> _ which he attended _ is ` Nothing but the best,' and that is what <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> sought. He was always comparing himself with other writers to show that he was the world champion writer.''

<BYLINE>Repeal of Confidentiality Measure Sent to Texas Governor ^By PEGGY
FIKAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A bill repealing a new law that allowed police to withhold the names of all felony victims has been sent to Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON>, who will sign it, a spokeswoman says. `` At the direction of the governor, our staff worked with sponsors of the bill to make sure the problem was straightened out,'' said <PERSON> Rossanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>, deputy gubernatorial press secretary. The repeal was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> with a 134-0 vote after it was amended to protect certain crime victims from being contacted by companies soliciting business, such as those selling home security systems. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> concurred with the amendment, 27-0, and sent the bill to <PERSON> Clements </PERSON>. News organizations decried the confidentiality law after several law enforcement agencies began withholding information they previously had made public. The law was passed during the regular session that ended May 29. Some agencies withheld information on missing children and accident victims, said <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> Light Publisher <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Irish </PERSON> in testimony this week to a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee. Irish represented <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION>, a first amendment and freedom-of-information coalition of seven news organizations, in urging repeal. Rep. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, who sponsored the confidentiality law and the bill repealing it, said the original measure `` was being broadly applied to accident victims, DWIs, missing children _ all the kinds of things that we want to provide information on.'' `` So we repealed it, and we're going to take a look at it in the future,'' said <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>. <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said the bill sent to the governor accomplishes `` about half'' of what he wants in order to protect crime victims, but that he wanted `` an ample opportunity for full discussion'' before attempting further changes. The bill, in addition to the repeal, would prohibit using crime victim information obtained from law enforcement agencies to solicit business from the victim or a family member of the victim. The prohibition would apply to victims who were injured in a crime or whose home was illegally entered. The bill would give the attorney general power to sue under the Deceptive Trade Practices Act to stop such use of the information. Violation of the law would be punishable by civil penalties up to $ 10,000 plus court costs and attorney's fees. The repeal would be immediate, and the solicitation section would take effect Jan. 1.

 An infant was killed with a gun her 6-year-old sister found under their parents' pillow hours after Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> signed a bill intended to protect children from accidental shootings. Ten-month-old <PERSON> Enercida </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> was shot late late Wednesday and died early today at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joseph </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, police said. She was the seventh victim of such an accident since June 1. `` The 6-year-old found the .38 - caliber revolver laying on their parents' bed under a pillow ... and thinking it was a toy, and fired it one time, striking the girl in the head,'' said <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> police officer <PERSON> S. </PERSON> Possible charges are pending against the girls' parents, <PERSON> Amancio </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reina </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON>, and police are continuing to investigate the shooting, <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON> said. But the law <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> signed Wednesday does n't take effect until October 1 and wo n't apply in this case, he said. The law requires gun owners to take reasonable precautions to keep loaded weapons in their homes and businesses out of the hands of children age 15 and younger by using trigger locks or keeping the weapon in a locked box. `` This will assist in protecting our children throughout the state,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said. `` The added public awareness will prompt adults to keep guns out of reach.'' Wednesday's signing ceremony also came one day after a 9-year-old <LOCATION> Clearwater </LOCATION> boy shot himself in the finger. <PERSON> Tomy </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemko </PERSON> found the .25 - caliber pistol after climbing onto a chair to get some potato chips from atop the refrigerator in his grandmother's He was treated for a broken finger. Three children died and two were wounded in the earlier shootings, inspiring lawmakers to push for the first-of-its kind legislation during a special session last month. The law provides for adult gun owners to be charged with a felony, punishable by up to five years in prison and a $ 5,000 fine, if a child shoots himself or another child because of the owner's carelessness If a minor threatens someone with the gun or displays it in public, its owner faces a misdemeanor charge and up to 60 days in jail with a $ 500 fine. No grieving parent of an injured or fatally wounded child shot by another member of the family could be arrested until seven days after the shooting. There are exemptions for hunting and target-shooting accidents and those involving guns taken illegally. The measure also will authorize the development of a gun safety program in the state's public schools. The Unified Sportsmen of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the state affiliate of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, helped lawmakers write legislation it could support after a stronger version it opposed was rejected during the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s regular 60-day session, which ended June 3. The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law may inspire similar legislation in other states, said <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, state legislative director for Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Handgun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Jury to Avoid Movie</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge cited parallels between an international money laundering case and the plot of `` Lethal Weapon 2'' in forbidding a jury to see the film until after the trial. None of the jurors in the trial of three men _ including the <LOCATION> Yugoslavian </LOCATION> consul general in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> _ had seen the film as of Tuesday when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> DuBois </PERSON> issued his order. He told jurors to avoid seeing the film, reading reviews of it, and talking to anyone who has seen it for the trial's duration. <PERSON> DuBois </PERSON> said the order was a `` small imposition'' to ensure a fair trial, which began June 19. It is expected to last into August. The film, which stars <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> and opened in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> over the weekend, is about an international money laundering scheme involving a South African diplomat and an eccentric accountant who has laundered money for the mob and has decided to cooperate with prosecutors. The trial has a similar theme. The key prosecution witness is <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, a chemical engineer and tax protester who aspired to be a money launderer for the mob. Cole was arrested Dec. 1 at <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and in April pleaded guilty and became the prosecution's key witness. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> said the similar plot lines of movie and trial were coincidental. `` Lethal Weapon 2'' began filming in November and the script was written months earlier. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON>, the attorney for <PERSON> Bahrudin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bijedic </PERSON>, 48, the <LOCATION> Yugoslavian </LOCATION> consul general on trial, asked <PERSON> DuBois </PERSON> for the order. He said <PERSON> Bijedic </PERSON> was `` deeply depressed'' after seeing the film. <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> added that he felt the movie could sway a juror against his client. The others on trial are <PERSON> Vinko </PERSON> <PERSON> Mir </PERSON>, 54, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, chairman of the board of <ORGANIZATION> LBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Vjeskoslov </PERSON> <PERSON> Spanjol </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> Plano </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, a naturalized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen; and the bank itself. They are charged in a conspiracy to launder $ 3.5 million provided by undercover <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents during 1987 and 1988 in a sting operation. Spanjol is also charged with violating the Arms Export Control Act by allegedly smuggling two restricted underwater breathing devices into <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Another man, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Card </PERSON>, 50, of <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, has pleaded guilty to the scheme.

 Anyone can move a harp, but few can do it with the charm and wit of <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Verbugt </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruls </PERSON>. Organizers of the <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Competition </ORGANIZATION> realized this when they invited the `` Dutch boys'' to move harps here during the 10-day competition. `` They're just really fun to have around,'' said <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hainen </PERSON>, one of four finalists. `` They're good for everyone's spirits. The two have been known to dance all night and move harps all day without losing their charm. They take seriously the task of entertaining contestants who have been eliminated. Their responsibilities, however, are not all fun and games. Carrying the harp with its 47 strings and 2,000 moving pieces is serious business. Elaborate charts are required to get the right harp in the right place at the right moment. `` Contestants are very nervous normally,'' <PERSON> Bruls </PERSON> said. `` To break a harp is one thing. If you put it down with a bump, then they start saying, ` Oh no, the tuning is gone.' Before you break it, you can really screw up the tuning.'' The men also shuffle two piano benches and several special harp chairs for contestants. `` They want their own chairs,'' <PERSON> Verbugt </PERSON> said. `` It has to be in a particular position, with this side facing out or that one. Everything has to be that way, otherwise they can not get into their proper mood.'' `` They take the load off our shoulders,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, president and executive director of the competition. `` We'd have to hire somebody who'd have to be trained how to handle harps.'' During this competition at <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bruls </PERSON> and <PERSON> Verbugt </PERSON> have moved harps from practice rooms to the stage for 37 competitors. They also have stood on their heads to evoke smiles and held a harpist tightly when a painful finger forced her to quit the competition. Verbugt, a musicologist, and <PERSON> Bruls </PERSON>, a physicist, are the last to see a harpist before she goes onstage and the first to congratulate or console her after the performance. `` Some need a shoulder to cry on. Some need someone to laugh with,'' <PERSON> Bruls </PERSON> said. `` This stupid carrying, anyone can do it. The atmosphere you have to create, that makes it interesting to us.'' The men came upon their hobby by accident. <PERSON> Bruls </PERSON>' former girlfriend in <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> was a harpist, and he was enlisted to help move instruments at the first <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> there in 1983. That led to an invitation to the second congress in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1985 and the third in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> in 1987. `` It's a very nice way to see the world,'' <PERSON> Bruls </PERSON> said. The two say they've noticed that it also is a nice way to meet beautiful women. Ninety-nine percent of the world's top harpists are women. `` They need special attention,'' <PERSON> Verbugt </PERSON> said with a knowing smile. Verbugt comes to harp competitions to research a book he is writing on Dutch harpist <PERSON> Phia </PERSON> <PERSON> Berghout </PERSON>. Bruls uses them to escape the stress of physics and enjoy the heavenly sounds. `` I really like the music,'' he said. `` It's the best music there is.'' In addition to Ms. <PERSON> Hainen </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the other finalists are <PERSON> Kirsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Agresta </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> Bloomfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Casale </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Marie-Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavaroche </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. All four will perform solo and with orchestra Friday night in the last stage of competition. The first-place winner will receive a <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> concert harp worth more than $ 17,000 and a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> debut recital March 13 at <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Exxon, Coast Guard Debate Source of Oily Slick</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An oily slick several miles long may be from residue dissolving in the tanks of the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> as the damaged tanker goes in circles outside <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Coast Guard Cmdr. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Scarborough </PERSON> said Wednesday the residue may have dissolved as the ship entered the waters of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where the <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> is to undergo extensive repairs. The 987-foot ship was damaged in March when it crashed into a reef in <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. It spilled nearly 11 million gallons of oil, the worst spill in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. Officials were awaiting results of samples sent to a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> laboratory in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> to determine the source of this week's leak <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> officials say the material is leaking from the Valdez, but they do n't know what it is. The Valdez remained about 50 miles off <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> early today. It has been barred from entering the bay until it is free of environmental and navigational hazards. <PERSON> Scarborough </PERSON> said the difference in the water temperatures may have caused the recent leaking: `` That would explain why the folks in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> felt they had a clean ship when she sailed and would explain why we have a dirty ship now.'' But Exxon Shipping President <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Iarossi </PERSON> said he doubted that was the case. `` I do n't think temperature is a significant factor,'' <PERSON> Iarossi </PERSON> said. `` The reason is, we operate in 80-degree temperatures all the time.'' Alaskan waters were about 35 degrees; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>'s are about 60 degrees. <PERSON> Scarborough </PERSON> said the ship was trailing an oily slick about 11 miles long Wednesday but that the discharges have become intermittent and less concentrated. Two longer slicks that formed Monday and Tuesday were said to be dissipating. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> agreed Wednesday to hire a cleanup vessel to mitigate any environmental damage. Officials said the impact on fish and wildlife was expected to be negligible. Once the leakage stops for at least a 24-hour period, the ship will be towed to a sheltered cove, probably off Navy-owned <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clemente </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, so divers can remove five pieces of metal hanging from the hull to allow the ship to enter the shallow harbor. After the repairs, the ship is to enter the harbor to begin a $ 25 million overhaul at <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>, where it was built in 1986.

<HEAD>Woman Accused of Delivering Drugs to Her Unborn Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANFORD, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge must decide whether a cocaine addict whose two children were born with the drug in their bodies should be found guilty of delivering drugs to her unborn babies. A prosecutor said <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 23, knew she was feeding her daughter cocaine through the umbilical cord. `` She knew full well a long time ago that when she took cocaine, it went to that baby,'' Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Deen </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweeting </PERSON>, questioned whether her addiction justified charges of drug trafficking and child abuse. He said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> could not have known that she was committing such a crime and should be acquitted. `` No matter how egregious my client's behavior was, you can not make her criminally responsible for that which was not a crime yet,'' <PERSON> Sweeting </PERSON> said. Seminole Circuit Judge O.H. <PERSON> Eaton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who is hearing the case without a jury, presided over the first day of testimony Wednesday and said he may issue a verdict today. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Altamonte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, faces drug delivery charges normally reserved for drug pushers. Her daughter born in January and a son born in 1987 were found with traces of the illegal drug in their bodies. Her mother testified that <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> admitted to using cocaine during the past three years and while pregnant. The only other woman in the state to face similar charges had her case dropped recently on technical grounds. A grand jury in <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, refused to indict a woman for manslaughter in May in the cocaine-linked death of her 2-day-old daughter. In 1987, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> judge dismissed a charge of failure to provide medical care to a child, lodged against a woman whose son was born damaged and later died. Prosecutors had accused her of ignoring a doctor's advice not to abuse drugs. The <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> case could set a dangerous precedent, according to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which sent a representative from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and a doctor who testified on <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s behalf. Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kandall </PERSON> said it could not be proven without a doubt that the umbilical cord carried the illegal drug from <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> to her babies. <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> staff counselor <PERSON> Marjorie </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> the state could better spend its time finding ways to treat addicted women, and warned that a conviction could discourage cocaine users from seeking medical help when pregnant out of fear they may wind up in jail. `` Word travels fast,'' she said. But <PERSON> Deen </PERSON> argued that by holding <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> criminally liable, the state could take an active role in preventing women from having cocaine-addicted babies. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who now lives in an <LOCATION> Apopka </LOCATION> drug treatment center, did not testify. Her mother and aunt have custody of her children, who are healthy.

 <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroud </PERSON> arrived at federal court to hear her husband plead innocent to charges of stealing three <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jet engines. By the end of the hearing, she was standing next to him as a defendant. Mrs. <PERSON> Stroud </PERSON>, who was unaware of the allegations against her, was named in a 22-count grand jury indictment released Wednesday at a detention hearing for her husband, Senior Airman <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroud </PERSON>, and Airman 1st Class <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, both military policemen at <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Chesterland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Stroud </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, were arrested Monday in the July 3 theft of three 3,200-pound F-16 fighter jet engines from the northern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> installation. The jets are valued at $ 2 million each. Mrs. <PERSON> Stroud </PERSON>, 22, was charged at the detention hearing, where all three defendants pleaded innocent to the counts and were given Sept. 10 trial dates by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON>. The Strouds' attorney, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Madsen </PERSON>, said Mrs. <PERSON> Stroud </PERSON> had been due to be summoned to court rather than arrested. `` She did appear voluntarily and she was not aware of this until she did appear,'' he said. The arrests and 12 other indictments against as-yet unidentified people capped an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> sting operation aimed at servicemen, civilians and wholesalers in stolen goods at <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, other <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> military installations and elsewhere, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> and the Strouds were charged with selling or disposing of government property valued at more than $ 8.1 million, including the three engines, a flight-line tow tractor and three engine trailers. Mrs. <PERSON> Stroud </PERSON>'s alleged involvement was not explained. In Count 2, <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stroud </PERSON> were charged with aiding and abetting each other in stealing and selling $ 64,000 worth of <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> computers. <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> alone was named in Counts 3 through 22, which charged theft of such items as a combat helmet, chemical protective clothing, military supplies, aviation instruments, radios and bullet-proof vests. <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> held in the <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail after <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> told undercover agents that if he was caught, he would `` run and not be found.'' The magistrate ordered <PERSON> Stroud </PERSON> confined to barracks pending an agreement between prosecutors and his commander and also granted <PERSON> Stroud </PERSON> supervised visits with his 5-month-old daughter and wife, who was released.

 A tiny video camera and cable used in a federal investigation of political corruption were uncovered by a busboy at a restaurant across from <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION>, an attorney for the restaurant's owners says `` The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> planted the listening devices, and they were discovered by one of our busboys,'' attorney <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spina </PERSON> was quoted as saying in today's editions of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Borovilos </PERSON>, co-owner of the restaurant, said he waited several days to call the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> about the equipment because `` we did n't know who it belonged to. <PERSON> Borovilos </PERSON> said that after he talked to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday, agents removed the camera from the restaurant. They left behind the connecting wire that ran under a seat cushion, through a concrete wall and down into the basement of the building, he told the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Spina </PERSON> said the sophisticated wide-angle camera, with a lens the size of a little finger, was found Friday hidden in the base of a booth at Counselors Row Restaurant, a popular spot for lawmakers, lawyers, government workers and other City Hall employees. He said the camera was pointed at a table often used by <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Roti </PERSON>, Democratic ward Committeeman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Arco </PERSON> and influential businessman <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcy </PERSON>. The paper quoted unidentified sources as saying the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> also tapped a telephone on a pedestal next to the table. <PERSON> Spina </PERSON> said the restaurant's owners were `` shocked, outraged and extremely upset that this type of conduct exists in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, the federal prosecutor in charge of organized crime investigations in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said he had authorized planting the device, <PERSON> Spina </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Spina </PERSON> said a judge approved the installation of the surveillance equipment and it was placed in the restaurant without the owners' consent, apparently on a weekend when the place was closed <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mell </PERSON>, who also frequents the table or ones nearby, said, `` I have no problem with -LRB- the bugs -RRB-.

The <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> network affiliate <ORGANIZATION> WMAQ-TV </ORGANIZATION> reported that the strike force has been investigating possible corruption in the 1st Ward, including gambling in its <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION> section. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> declined to comment, as did <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Organized </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, the television station said. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillogly </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's office, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> early today he did n't know anything about the story. <PERSON> D'Arco </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marcy </PERSON> did n't return telephone messages, <ORGANIZATION> WMAQ </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> said.

 An aide to Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said today that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was conducting `` clear, official and unequivocal'' negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> via intermediaries from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries. `` Whoever does n't admit or recognize this, whoever tries to ignore it is like a small boy who closes his eyes and thinks the world does n't see him,'' said the aide, Deputy Finance Minister <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Beilin </PERSON>. He spoke on army radio after testimony by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> raised a storm in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which has officially boycotted the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, calling it a terrorist group bent on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s destruction. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, replying to a question during a congressional hearing in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Wednesday, said it would be an `` exaggeration'' to say an official dialogue is taking place between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. But he said there was `` classified reporting about contacts'' between the two that he would discuss only in a closed-door session. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, chairman of the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> that is a partner in the governing coalition, deny any <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> talks have taken place with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's an absolute lie. We are not speaking either directly or indirectly with that group,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s spokesman <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> said, reiterating the premier's remarks in a telephone interview today. But <PERSON> Beilin </PERSON> claimed the denials were only technical. `` For 2 -LCB- months, clear, official, unequivocal negotiations have been under way between the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> government headed by <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, via the Americans,'' <PERSON> Beilin </PERSON> said. Other foreign diplomats, including <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s minister of foreign affairs, <PERSON> Butros </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghali </PERSON>, were also involved in these contacts, he added. <PERSON> Beilin </PERSON> said the entire process was indirect and that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, in keeping with its policies, had not sent any official messages to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leaders. `` We speak to the Americans, raise proposals, the Americans go to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Beilin </PERSON> said. `` They come back to us. If they tell us they talked to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> we shut the door, if they say they spoke to Palestinians, we open it and listen to what they have to say.'' <PERSON> Beilin </PERSON> also urged the government to `` recognize and take advantage of it -LRB- the contacts -RRB- before it will be too late.'' He said the government should deal with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> or would have to face more radical Palestinian leaders. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has held indirect contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in the past, most notably in 1981 when former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> envoy <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Habib </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> helped negotiate a cease-fire agreement between the two along the Lebanese border. The pact fell apart a year later when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to rout guerrilla strongholds in response to attacks on Israelis in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by Palestinian extremists. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, toned down its threats to leave the governing coalition after appeals from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to give <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s peace plan another chance. Labor charges that the plan has been damaged by new hard-line conditions imposed by <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc July 5 that decrease chances for Palestinian acceptance. But after Labor ministers met Wednesday night, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said: `` We have no aspiration to break up the government. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> aims to work for the advancement of the peace plan.'' The easing of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s threat appeared aimed at giving <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> time to renew his commitment to the peace initiative. The plan calls for Palestinians in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to elect representatives for negotiations on limited self-rule. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s new conditions demand that the 19-month Palestinian uprising end before a vote occurs and specify that the Arabs in Israeli-annexed east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> can not cast ballots, a key Palestinian demand. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops shot and killed a Palestinian in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> when a gang of masked youths attacked a patrol with knives and axes, the army said today. The victim was identified as <PERSON> Riad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashem </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> El-Shakra </PERSON>, 18. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said he was shot in the chest at the Khan Yunis refugee camp, and the army said he died after he was evacuated to <LOCATION> Soroka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The death raised to at least 560 the number of Palestinians killed since Arabs launched their uprising in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 22-year occupation. Thirty-five Israelis also have been slain. Five other Palestinians were shot and wounded today as protests broke out during the Moslem holiday of Eid Al-Adha, or Feast of Sacrifice, the climax of the annual pilgrimage to <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s holiest shrine in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. Four of the wounded were in the <LOCATION> Jabaliya </LOCATION> refugee camp in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>.

 Portrait artist <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> quickly put his talents to work after someone snatched a gold chain from his neck in a restaurant parking lot. This week, <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> added a painting of a common thief to his credits of nearly 2,000 portraits, including members of four royal families. `` Do you know how many people who have been robbed wished they could have been able to do this?'' asked <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON>. `` I remember saying many years ago if anybody robs me, they better hide because I'll have a life-sized painting of them out immediately. <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON>, 57, of <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, was leaving a fast-food restaurant Monday night when someone walked up to him and told him, `` Pops, how about 50 cents,'' according to police. <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> ignored the man and kept walking. `` He got in his car and the guy reached in and grabbed his neck and pulled off the chain,'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Deren </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON>'s studio director, said Wednesday. The chain and scarab were worth $ 1,000, police said. Police who searched the area did n't turn up anything. <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> then went home and drew a sketch, and the following morning completed his portrait, <PERSON> Deren </PERSON> said. Within 12 hours of the snatching, <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> handed the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> a signed and framed 24-by-30-inch oil painting of the suspect. <PERSON> Deren </PERSON> said the painting shows the suspect with his hand up, holding the chain. Next to the portrait is a description of the man, who police said remained at large Wednesday. `` People have come in before with sketches,'' said Detective <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>. But `` this is the first time anyone has ever brought a portrait with such clarity.'' <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> usually charges $ 25,000 or more for his portraits. In 1969, he painted an <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> portrait that hangs at his Graceland estate in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn </LOCATION>. He did a portrait of former President and Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as a state gift from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>' Ferdinand and <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> in 1984, two years before they fled to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> also has painted portraits of <LOCATION> Monaco </LOCATION>'s royal family, King Fahd of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> II in <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, and of the Sultan of <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION> and his family.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> joined President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and more than 30 other world leaders today to commemorate the French Revolution's ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity. The 15-minute noontime ceremony at the Place du Trocadero launched a busy weekend of bicentennial parties and international diplomacy, grouped around the annual summit of the seven biggest industrial democracies. Actors read portions of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen, proclaimed in October 1789 before the French Revolution turned to terror and tyranny. Interspersed were choral segments and quotations from revolutionary leaders. At the end, children dressed in white ran to a stone inscribed with the declaration and ringed it with wreaths and flowers. Five hundred doves were released to fly freely into the almost cloudless sky. The presidents and prime ministers, with several hundred invited guests, sat in warm sunshine overlooking the Trocadero esplanade and _ across the <LOCATION> Seine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> _ the Eiffel Tower. The leaders arrived in a steady stream of limousines and were greeted by <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>. A cheer went up from a crowd on the street when <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> arrived. Among the other guests were Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> Sese Seko of <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> and other African leaders, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Brazilian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and Uruguayan President <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON>. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sat to the left of <PERSON> Danielle </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> in the front row of a section of temporary stands set aside for the leaders' spouses The capital was prepared for another Bastille mob scene later in the day, but unlike the storming 200 years ago that began the French Revolution, this crowd was gathering for celebration. The inaugural concert of the Opera <PERSON> Bastille </PERSON> was expected to attract a range of dignitaries, including 30 heads of state, and the cream of French society. Operagoers descending the dramatic gray stone staircase leading to the modern glass-and-steel opera house late tonight were to face a cultural event of an altogether different sort. Thousands of Parisians and tourists will be dancing in the streets at a bicentennial bash billed as the `` World's Biggest Ball.'' The street dance, one of 36,000 outdoor parties taking place in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> during the three-day nationwide celebration, will take bicentennial bingers into the wee hours of Friday morning. A traditional military parade marches down the Champs Elysee early Friday, accompanied by tanks, fighters and helicopters roaring overhead. In the evening, impresario <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Goude </PERSON>'s bizarre opera-ballet-parade called `` La Marseilleise'' will strut and struggle down the famous avenue in a salute to the international spirit of 1789. Britons will parade in an artificial rain, Russians will dance with a bear on ice and an American marching band will boogie backward all the way. The parade will be broadcast to millions of viewers worldwide. <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> festivities will conclude with a bang, as a spectacular display of fireworks illuminates the City of Lights on Saturday.

 Homicide detectives believe a 22-year-old woman is the latest victim in a series of 41 killings dating back to 1985. Sheriff's deputies found <PERSON> Nicolette </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Frye </PERSON>'s body Monday in a ravine in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The investigation of her death has been taken over by a task force looking into the deaths of the other women in similar circumstances. <PERSON> Frye </PERSON> had been dead three or four days when her body was found lying at the bottom of a steep embankment near <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, which is north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. Her body was fully clothed, unlike most of the other victims, who were left naked or partially clad. Court records show that <PERSON> Frye </PERSON> had a history of prostitution and drug use as did most of the other victims. An autopsy on <PERSON> Frye </PERSON>'s body was inconclusive. The cause of death will not be known until further tests have been conducted. <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homicide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> said there are no suspects. <PERSON> Frye </PERSON>'s boyfriend, <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Astorga </PERSON>, and others said she was trying to put her life back together. But <PERSON> Astorga </PERSON> said <PERSON> Frye </PERSON>'s problems with drugs were not over and that she probably was working as a prostitute on the streets shortly before she died. Many of the deaths are similar to an unsolved string of 48 killings in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area from 1982 through 1984.

 Cable television mogul <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> called anti-abortion activists `` Bozos,'' and proclaimed that if anyone does n't like his station's soon-to-be-broadcast abortion program with a pro-choice angle, then tough. `` You bet your bippy we're taking a position,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said Wednesday of the program `` Abortion for Survival,'' scheduled for a July 20 broadcast on his TBS SuperStation. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> told a gathering of television critics and writers at the National Cable Forum that he did n't even try to find sponsors for the half-hour show. `` We'll just take a lick for a night. You know, so it'll cost us four or five hundred thousand dollars,'' he said. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, his language weaving in and out of what's allowed in a family newspaper, criticized anti-abortion activists, saying they try to impose their views on others. `` I do n't want anybody else telling me what my daughter's got to have, or my wife, or my girlfriend,'' said <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. `` We live in a free country. There is absolutely no way that that's anybody's business but the person that's involved That's my opinion.'' Despite his convictions, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> will broadcast a panel discussion after `` Abortion for Survival,'' with people on both sides of the issue. Just do n't expect him to listen. `` We'll give the other Bozos a chance to talk back,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. `` They look like idiots anyway.'' And that's not all, he said. `` The pro-lifers say we do n't want people to have sex for fun, only to have babies. It's sinful. Sex is sinful,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. `` Well, that's fine if those people do n't want to ever have sex. Swell. I happen to enjoy it. I do n't get near as much as I want to.''

 A woman wearing a wig and dark glasses shot and killed a college maintenance chief in the school courtyard, then fled into a nearby subway station and escaped in the morning rush-hour crowds, police said. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Roscoe </PERSON>, 43, was shot three times in the back Wednesday. He died a short time later at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>.

The killer, described as in her 20s, yelled, `` You lying mother,'' before shooting <PERSON> Roscoe </PERSON> with a small-caliber handgun, a security guard told police, according to the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> in today's editions. Before disappearing into the subway station, the woman shed the black wig and sunglasses, which were retrieved, said police spokesman Sgt. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>. The gun was not recovered. About 50,000 subway commuters were delayed for more than 30 minutes after police stopped a train to search for the suspect, said <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Termaine Garden.

 A man who was accused of spreading rumors after he spoke to an American television crew about the military assault on <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> was sentenced to 10 years in prison today. The television news said <PERSON> Xiao </PERSON> <PERSON> Bin </PERSON>, 42, also was deprived of all political rights for three years in a decision by a court in <LOCATION> Dalian </LOCATION>, northeast <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Xiao </PERSON>, vice section chief in a rubber factory, was charged with spreading counterrevolutionary rumors after telling an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> television crew that 20,000 people were killed when the army fired on pro-democracy protesters and their supporters June 3-4. During the interview with <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Xiao </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> was covered with blood and that tanks had run over people. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> denied anyone was killed in Tiananmen Square. It says about 200 civilians died when soldiers were forced to fire on rioters who blocked their way as they entered Tiananmen Square. Chinese sources and Western diplomats have put the figure as high as 3,000 and say troops fired randomly into crowds. <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> apparently intercepted the unedited video as <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> sent it by satellite to its <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> headquarters. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s state-run television broadcast the interview and urged viewers to help find the man. Two women reported him within hours, and he was arrested June 11. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said it was `` deeply distressed'' over the use of its tape, and it began covering the faces of students it interviewed. Foreign travel agents today urged <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to end martial law in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, lower tour prices and mount a public relations campaign abroad if it wants to bring back tourists scared by the crackdown. During a daylong meeting, many agents said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> should invest in overseas tour promotions, something it does not normally do. `` They want people to come in _ they have to go outside,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Spreadborough </PERSON> of Silk Route Travel in <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. `` Our problem is destination credibility. We know it's safe, but until there is some sizeable effort from big guns in <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> tourism, we're fighting an uphill battle.'' <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> of Pacific Delight Tours in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> said his company lost hundreds of thousands of dollars on promotional material for now-canceled <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> tours. Since the military crackdown, tourism in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has nearly halted. When 16 foreigners arrived in the eastern province of <LOCATION> Jiangxi </LOCATION> today, local officials gave them a ceremony and welcomed them as the first foreign visitors in two months, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. Earlier today, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> denied <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has suffered a diplomatic loss of face and said most nations support its tough measures to eliminate political dissent. `` The fact is that there are only a few countries who are interfering in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s internal affairs,'' ministry spokeswoman <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Jinhua </PERSON> said at a weekly briefing. `` The majority of countries have expressed their understanding, sympathy and even support for us.'' Most Western governments have suspended high-level official contacts and taken other measures to protest the violence and mass arrests of protesters. Some socialist and non-aligned countries, such as <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, have joined in criticizing <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> criticized <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> for sheltering two fugitives, student activist <PERSON> Wu'er </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaixi </PERSON> and political theorist <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiaqi </PERSON>, who are wanted by <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> police for instigating and organizing protests. `` The fact that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> allowed them to go to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and to openly carry out activities there aimed at subverting the government of the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is a flagrant violation of international law, and the norms governing international relations, and it is also a gross interference in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s internal affairs and a serious violation of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s sovereignty,'' she said.

 A suspended <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest is rejecting a call by the church's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> black bishops that he abandon his unsanctioned African-American Catholic congregation. `` The people have spoken,'' the Rev. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said Wednesday, citing the number of people who attended the first two weeks of services at his <ORGANIZATION> Imani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> the bishops' statement was `` predictable'' and said they `` opted for office and position over their ability to exercise a prophetic voice'' in the leadership of the 53-million-member American church's nearly 2 million black members. The priest said he has no intention of abandoning his church, adding instead that he plans to expand it. He has contended that the Catholic church fails to address the needs of its black parishioners. The bishops, in a statement, said <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> `` possesses the vibrancy of our culture and spiritual heritage'' but should make those changes within the church. `` We implore him to return to the unity of the church,'' the bishops said, `` and to continue to urge reform ... within the unity of the one Catholic church.'' Cardinal <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON>, archbishop of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said in a column published in the Post today that the controversy over <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>' church `` is not a dispute between those who oppose racism and those who support it.'' The dispute `` has more to do with the problems and expectations of one individual than broader questions about the adequacy of the church's ministry in the black community,'' <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> said. `` To Father <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>, I say come home.'' In a statement distributed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION>, the 13 bishops said racism exists in the church but that the problem must be solved by dialogue between the black community and the church leaders. Baltimore's auxiliary Bishop <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricard </PERSON> said in an interview, `` It is the absolute intent of the black bishops to seek some type of reconciliation with Father <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>. In no way do we want to cut off dialogue.'' The bishops said they had a `` dual love and devotion'' to the faith of the church and to their black cultural heritage, but unlike <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>, they did not feel the two were in conflict. <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>' suspension means he may not celebrate mass or administer any Roman Catholic sacraments. An estimated 1,000 people have signed up for the <ORGANIZATION> Imani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> has received more than $ 39,000 in church offerings in just two weeks. <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> has said he wants to see establishment of an African-American rite within the Catholic church. Earlier this week, he said he would present a reconciliation plan to the archdiocese of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, but only on his terms. Signing the statement were <PERSON> Ricard </PERSON> and Archbishop <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, Bishop <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Howze </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Biloxi </LOCATION>, Miss.; and auxiliary bishops <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyke </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Steib </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Guillory </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Galveston-Houston </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Somewhere in this Central European capital there is a tiny elderly woman who will forever treasure President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit. She bears his raincoat as a souvenir, given to her by the president after he spoke Tuesday in a driving rainstorm in Kossuth Square. -LRB- The raincoat, it turned out, belonged to a <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent accompanying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. -RRB- But among the vast populace of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, there was little evidence that the people have fallen victim to <LOCATION> Georgiemania </LOCATION> to rival the emotion Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> stirred in his own recent travels to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Still, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was a hit, especially in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, the Baltic seaport city that gave birth to the Polish trade union movement Solidarity. Roughly 25,000 people swarmed around the monument to slain workers to cheer <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with chants of `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>!'' They sang the Solidarity anthem and flashed the Solidarity `` V'' for victory salute beneath the 80-foot-high monument at the shipyard gates. Shouts of `` Stay with us, stay with us!'' rang out after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that if he were a young man he would want to stay to participate in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s transformation to a free-market economy. But the prediction of <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Studdert </PERSON>, a White House advance man, that tens of thousands would turn out for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> did not materialize. Nor was there an immense turnout in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> even though <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was the first American president to visit the country _ and he brought promises of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, as he had to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, by contrast, made a tremendous political impact on both <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, though the turnout in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, at least, was widely considered to be a disappointment. The reason may be the Soviet leader represented a historic change in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s approach to the East-West problem. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, on the other hand, also promoted a relaxation of tensions, but he is a relatively colorless <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> leader who does not approach <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s charisma. Besides, for policy reasons, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> forswore any intended rivalry with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` We're not trying to make things more difficult for him,'' the president said before setting out for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` Just as when he goes to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> I do n't think he's trying to make things more difficult for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was welcomed last month in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> by large crowds shouting `` <LOCATION> Gorby </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gorby </LOCATION>'' everywhere he went. He constantly outranks all Western leaders in popularity polls in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. During a ceremony at the official residence of West German President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON>, the Soviet leader kissed a high school girl. The next day, the mass-circulation <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> newspaper ran the picture on the front page with a banner headline: `` A kiss for <PERSON> Annette </PERSON>, a kiss for <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, though, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s public appearance stirred less of a public response. `` French crowds simply tend to be less demonstrative than German ones,'' said <PERSON> Dominique </PERSON> <PERSON> Moisi </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s political impact was unquestioned. French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, in a rare gesture, invited <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his wife to dinner at their apartment in the Latin Quarter. This may have been the first time a Soviet leader was invited to dine at the home of a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> leader, and it signaled how important <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit was taken by the French. And yet, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was supposed to work the crowd at the Place de la Bastille, but shook only a few hands and did not stay long. On the other hand, in Kossuth Square, about 2,000 drenched Hungarians withstood a driving rain to see <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday. The president appeared to be touched by their tribute. He tore up his speech and said he wanted to `` just speak from the heart.'' Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, clearly not an impartial observer, was asked to compare <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s travels with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s at a news conference Wednesday. He said he thought the president's crowds were `` pretty good _ pretty terrific, as a matter of fact, in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and particularly in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>.'' But <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> urged reporters to keep in mind the president's objective _ active engagement with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> as they pursue fundamental reform efforts `` And that's why we're here,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, `` not out of any idea that we need to compete with General Secretary <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>.''

 A propane gas explosion at a refinery in the oil fields east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> killed four workers, injured six and shattered windows a half-mile away, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The official Soviet news agency said the explosion occurred early Wednesday at a distillation plant within the Minnibayevsky Gas Refinery in <LOCATION> Almetyevsk </LOCATION>, an oil center 500 miles east of the capital. A government inquiry determined the explosion was caused by a propane gas leak, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. All local gas pipelines were shut off after the accident, and a fire that followed the explosion was extinguished, it said. Last month, a gas pipeline leaked and exploded as two passenger trains were passing in the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. More than 600 people were killed.

<HEAD>Panel Recommends No New Effort To Find Cold Fusion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> advisory panel says it found no convincing evidence that the phenomena attributed to `` cold fusion'' in <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> experiments would produce useful sources of energy. The panel recommended Wednesday that no new government effort be made to verify the experiments that startled the international scientific community last March. `` Evidence for the discovery of a new nuclear process termed cold fusion is not persuasive,'' the panel's draft report said. `` Hence, no special programs to establish cold fusion research centers or to support new efforts to find cold fusion are justified at the present time.'' The report by 22 non-government scientists will go to the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which is due to make an official recommendation to Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> by July 31. The advisory panel said in its report, based on eight weeks of study, that while no new efforts to find cold fusion were justified, there remain `` scientifically interesting questions'' about the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> experiments that `` should be handled by carefully focused and cooperative efforts within current programs.'' Cold fusion is the claim of <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> scientists that the decomposition of water at room temperature into hydrogen and oxygen by an electric current passing through a palladium electrode leads to the absorption of hydrogen atoms in the electrode, which then fuse to produce helium and large amounts of heat. If such a process could work on a large scale, it would make possible limitless supplies of cheap energy. Some laboratories have duplicated parts of the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> experiment, but most that have tried have been unable to do so.

<HEAD>City Council Bans Wood Shake Shingles For New Construction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> voted to ban roofs made of wood shingles to protect buildings from fire, despite objections from industry officials who said the shingles are safe. The proposal, approved 11-1 Wednesday, would apply to new buildings and to roofs requiring repairs to 10 percent or more of their surfaces. The measure goes to Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, who has taken no position. If the proposed ordinance is signed into law and survives a possible legal challenge, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> would become the first major <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> city to ban wood shake shingles. The measure was strongly opposed by the cedar-shingle industry, which counts on the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area for three-quarters of its $ 50 million in annual sales of shingles treated with fire-retardant chemicals. At stake are hundreds of jobs and millions of investment dollars in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, where most of the lumber for the shingles is harvested and processed. The industry contends that the treated shingles are as safe as those made of asphalt or Fiberglas. But city fire officials said the treated shingles lose their effectiveness with time. `` There is not one shred of doubt in my mind,'' City Fire <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Drummond </PERSON> told the council. If <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> approves the ban, the industry will take the matter to court, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Westfall </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Cedar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shake </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Shingle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>.

 An 8-year-old girl has become the youngest person on record to swim the rough, icy waters of the Golden Gate, the mile-wide passage where the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> meets <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. `` It was scary and the waves were high and I wanted to give up 100 yards from the finish,'' <PERSON> Emma </PERSON> <PERSON> Macchiarini-Mankin </PERSON> said Wednesday at a news conference after the 68-minute swim. Hypothermia and the tortuous, 60-degree current were the biggest risks for the 5-foot, 75-pound, freckle-faced swimmer, who avoided an outgoing <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ship during the swim from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> to the seaweed-covered rocks at <LOCATION> Lime </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>. The distance is one mile and 52 feet. <PERSON> Emma </PERSON> was accompanied on the swim by her distance coach and father, <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Macchiarini </PERSON>. <PERSON> Macchiarini </PERSON>, who made his 12th crossing of the strait, introduced <PERSON> Emma </PERSON> to pool swimming at 10 months and dunked her in the bay when she was 5. Asked why she wanted to swim from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Marin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, she said, `` Because I do n't know how to drive a car there.'' She then added, `` I want to be famous and have all the money.'' She alternated strokes _ seven minutes freestyle, seven breaststroke and seven on her back, spouting seawater. Her father, who has coached her in thrice-weekly swims, said her speed improved dramatically in the past week. The fourth-grader, who wore a green, red and purple suit with a pink bow in the back, held both arms up like a winning boxer as she emerged from the water. Before <PERSON> Emma </PERSON>, the youngest swimmer was <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, who was 12 in 1964 when he made it in 54 minutes and 30 seconds. <PERSON> Emma </PERSON> said she feared sharks during the swim, although her father insisted there were none in the bay. `` I made a deal with the sharks,'' she said. `` I would n't eat them if they would n't eat me.''

 A man convicted of a shooting rampage that killed a former girlfriend, three of her relatives and two others should receive the death penalty, a jury recommended. Sentencing was set for July 26 for <PERSON> David </PERSON> `` Moochie'' <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, 31, after the jury issued its recommendation Wednesday. The same jury on June 19 convicted <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> of six counts of murder stemming from the Dec. 6, 1986, rampage, described as <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>'s worst mass killing <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> and his girlfriend burst into the home of <PERSON> Dellane </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabrey </PERSON>, 17, his former girlfriend, and went from room to room shooting occupants, some of whom were asleep. <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> had a long-running feud with the woman's family. Ms. <PERSON> Mabrey </PERSON> died, along with two of her brothers, <PERSON> Sean </PERSON>, 21, and <PERSON> Darnell </PERSON>, 20; her 2-year-old daughter, <ORGANIZATION> Valencia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION>, 2; and two houseguests, <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, 34, and her 4-year-old son, <PERSON> Dwayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. Two other people, including Ms. <PERSON> Mabrey </PERSON>'s 3-month-old son, were wounded. <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, 31, showed no emotion as the verdict was read. However, after the jury had been dismissed, he said he was `` relieved for the victims' families and for mine that this ordeal has finally come to rest.''

 A military court today acquitted 23 soldiers of massacring 17 civilians. Another tribunal dismissed charges against a prominent officer accused of taking part in a bloody coup attempt in 1987. A six-member court-martial ruled unanimously that there was insufficient evidence to convict the 23 members of the army's 14th battalion of killing the civilians in the town of <LOCATION> Lupao </LOCATION> on Feb. 10, 1987. `` I am very happy because that means I can go back to the field,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Nestor </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, one of the defendants. A survivor, <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnate </PERSON>, had testified he saw <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> stab his father to death during the slayings. In a separate case, another court dismissed charges against air force Lt. Col. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> `` Red'' <PERSON> Kapunan </PERSON>. He had been accused of organizing cadets at the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> to join the Aug. 28, 1987 attempt to overthrow President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> in which 53 people were killed and hundreds wounded. <PERSON> Kapunan </PERSON> was an associate of the coup leader, former Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> `` Gringo'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, and a prominent member of a clique of officers loyal to Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>, the former defense minister. <PERSON> Kapunan </PERSON> was placed under house arrest in September. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> remains at large. In the Lupao case, human rights groups and the military prosecutors expressed surprise over the verdict because witnesses had identified that several of the accused as having taken part in the killings. Three of the defendants also were acquitted of charges they stole $ 500 from the survivors in the village, 85 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. Survivors told officials that troops dragged villagers from their homes and shot them with semi-automatic weapons after their lieutenant was shot and killed by communist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> visited the village soon after the slayings and promised justice to the villagers. Human rights organizations cited the Lupao killings as an example of civil liberties abuses under the Aquino administration. Filipino and international groups also had criticized the military because no one had been punished in the incident.

 Iranians beating their heads and chests in grief flocked to <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s gold-domed tomb today to mark the end of 40 days of mourning for the founder of the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. The official media, including <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said millions of people braved scorching heat and turned out for the ceremony at the Baheshte Zahra cemetery. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said 20,000 people `` suffered heart problems,'' were injured, or simply collapsed as temperatures soared to 104. Some were reported in serious condition even after treatment at makeshift medical facilities set up along roads leading to the cemetery, said the agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. The crowds began gathering at the cemetery at 5 a.m., more than 13 hours before a religious ceremony at the grave. Broadcasting live from the graveyard 10 miles south of the capital, <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> showed mourners being carried over the crowds, apparently after fainting. Firefighters sprayed the crowd with water. Mourners beat their heads and chests in a traditional Shiite Moslem expression of grief, stopping occasionally to wipe sweat away with handkerchiefs or the sleeves of their shirts. Loudspeakers along the roads and at the cemetery blared recitings from the Koran, Islam's holy book. Relief facilities included a central clinic with 1,000 physicians, nurses and relief workers on duty round the clock. Fifty makeshift medical centers and four rest houses also were set up to offer services to motorists and pedestrians, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said. It said dozens of stands offering food and refreshments dotted highways and streets connecting <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> with other cities and provinces. The government provided about 600 vehicles to ferry mourners to the cemetery, but many ended up walking as human waves blocked the streets. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> died June 3 at age 86. At least eight people were killed and thousands collapsed from exhaustion in the mayhem of his funeral June 6 when millions packed <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s streets. A government insurance program covered all those who gathered at the tomb today, the end of the period of mourning in the Shiite Moslem faith. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s state-run insurance companies announced that $ 13,500 will be paid to the family of anyone who dies or is seriously injured during the ceremony today. Medical expenses of up to $ 2,000 will also be paid. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, who toppled 2,500 years of monarchy, was buried in a dusty plot alongside thousands of followers killed in the 1979 revolution and thousands who died later in the war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The grave has become a shrine, with hundreds of thousands of Iranians gathering around it each day.

 Seven <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers were wounded early today when an `` explosive device'' was thrown at them as they were walking through a village in northern <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, the Pentagon said. The condition of the soldiers was not immediately available, but they are being treated in a local hospital, said a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Maj. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>. She said said nine soldiers were involved in the incident, but only seven were injured. She said the military personnel apparently were off duty and were walking through the village at the time of the attack. `` They were just walking down the street in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cieba </LOCATION>,'' the spokeswoman said. `` Some sort of explosive device was thrown at them.'' She said she had no specific information about the identities of the personnel, their specific units, rank or sex. `` The facts are very sketchy,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 An Armenian motorist was shot to death in a disputed enclave of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, and a government official said he was probably a victim of the ethnic unrest that has plagued the region since early last year. An <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Timokhin </PERSON>, said the Armenian's body was found Wednesday on the road to <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, the main city in the enclave, <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. The body of <PERSON> Artur </PERSON> <PERSON> Toniyan </PERSON> was left by his car near two villages populated by Azerbaijanis, <PERSON> Timokhin </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. The official said the attack was probably ethnically motivated. Tensions between Armenians, who are in a majority in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, and Azerbaijanis have run high since February 1988 because of a territorial dispute over the tiny, fertile region 1,200 miles south of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Armenians, who are predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>, claim they are persecuted by Azerbaijanis, who are mostly Moslem, and want <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> to be placed under the control of the nearby republic of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Two Azerbaijanis were killed and a third was seriously wounded on Tuesday near the village of <LOCATION> Kirkidzhan </LOCATION>. Reports conflicted about the circumstances, with some saying the men were ambushed by Armenians and others claiming they died in a car accident or killed each other in a dispute. A 1 a.m.-5 a.m. curfew remained in force in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a two-month-old strike was keeping most businesses closed, and armored personnel carriers patrolled the streets of <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>.

 Three gunmen shot nine people on a crowded street before leading police on a 12-mile chase that ended when their vehicle smashed into patrol cars at a roadblock, police said today. Police had no motive for the Wednesday night shootings, which witnesses said appeared to be indiscriminate. `` All of a sudden I saw these dudes coming down the middle of the street, shooting up in the air,'' said one witness, <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON>. `` They were saying things like ` You think you're bad.''' <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION> police Lt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Falzetti </PERSON> said today that nine people were wounded. `` None of the injuries are life threatening although some are more serious than others,'' <ORGANIZATION> Stamford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Perrotta </PERSON> said. After firing at the people, the gunmen led police on a circuitous, 60-mph car chase that ended in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaan </LOCATION> when their car crashed into two police cruisers and a stone wall, said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaan </LOCATION> Police Capt. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>.

 A small aircraft, its pilot apparently unconscious or dead, flew southward over the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> off the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> this morning and was rapidly running out of gas, officials said. Military jets and a cargo plane with a parachute rescue team aboard chased the twin-engine <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> 210 as it flew down the coast. The unidentified pilot reported to air traffic controllers at 8:30 a.m. that he was having chest pains and difficulty breathing. `` There has been nothing more from the pilot,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Pilots who tracked the plane later said he appeared to be slumped over the controls. There was no one else visible in the plane, officials said. Officials gave conflicting reports on how much fuel the plane, apparently on autopilot, had left at midmorning and on its location. <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said that at 10 a.m. the plane was about 250 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said the plane would run out of gas about 11:30 a.m., while Lt. Cmdr <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Karonis </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said the pilot indicated at 8:30 a.m. that he had four hours of fuel left. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Sapp </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, said an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> C-130 with a parachute rescue team aboard and a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> C-130 plane were following the plane down the coast. If it runs out of fuel at 11:30 a.m., he said, it would be about 250 miles east of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>. `` There's apparently nothing more we can do until it splashes down,'' <PERSON> Sapp </PERSON> said. `` When it does, the pararescue people will jump out of the plane.'' A helicopter would likely be sent from the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> station, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> aircraft took off from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> at about 6:30 a.m. Its flight plan indicated it was headed for <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said. After its distress call, it was intercepted by two <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F-A-18 </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hornets </ORGANIZATION> when it entered <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> Naval Station airspace at 8:45 a.m., said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The pilots of the intercepting planes saw the pilot slumped over the controls, <PERSON> John </PERSON> said. The Marine fliers were unable to establish voice contact with the <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> pilot, he said. <PERSON> Karonis </PERSON> said the plane was flying steadily at 10,000 feet. He said its heading varied from southeast to southwest `` as it gets pushed about by the wind.''

 A body that ashed ashore near a southern Mexican village six weeks ago has been tentatively identified as that of an employee of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign aid agency who had been on a hiking trip, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said today. The officials said dental records appeared to confirm that the victim was <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairchild </PERSON>, 43, who went to <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> on a hiking trip alone in May and crossed into <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> on June 1. The cause of death has not been established.

There was no identification on the body.

 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s chief said today a new government ethics law that has cost his agency several top managers has created `` a very disturbing situation.'' `` There are people who have left who could have given us three or four more years of service and that's a crying shame,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truly </PERSON> told a news conference. He spoke a day after <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aller </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION>, resigned. It was the ninth high-level agency resignation this year and <PERSON> Aller </PERSON> was the third to say publicly he is leaving because of the ethics law. Truly said the law, which becomes effective Sunday, has created `` a very disturbing situation.'' `` We know of a few others who are making their final decisions today and tomorrow literally,'' he said. `` It's not so much the number, but the quality and experience of these people,'' he said. `` When 10 senior service executive people leave you, they take with them 250 to 300 years of government leadership and experience when they walk out the door.'' The resignations and retirements have added to the management woes of Truly, who was sworn in just two weeks ago as administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` Frankly, it's so vague and undefined that I'm not aware of anybody in government or on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> or in industry that really understands its implications,'' <PERSON> Aller </PERSON> said of the ethics law after his resignation was announced Wednesday. `` For one that had planned at some point in time to go into private industry, -LRB- the law -RRB- almost insists that you resign before the 16th of July,'' he said. The ethics law, aimed at curtailing the `` revolving door'' personnel relationship between some federal agencies and private industry, takes effect Sunday after having been postponed once. The rules will bar federal contractors from hiring government officials who have supervised their competitors' projects. Truly said that despite the losses, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> still will be able to manage its programs, `` but it's not a good situation and one we need to deal with.'' Another who is quitting Saturday is <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballhaus </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Ballhaus </PERSON> was unhappy with `` inadequate compensation for senior federal executives and vague new post-government employment regulations.'' `` My family situation is such that public service in the current environment is no longer a viable option for me,'' said <PERSON> Ballhaus </PERSON>, who had been with the agency for 18 years. <PERSON> Aller </PERSON> joined <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> in 1964 and was deeply involved in the Apollo program, which culminated in man's first landing on the moon. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> celebrations of that anniversary next week are expected to include a call by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for a revitalized space program perhaps including a goal of landing on <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> or colonizing the moon. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement said <PERSON> Aller </PERSON> `` accelerated his departure because of the vague new post-government employee regulations'' and because of `` many disappointments in the treatment of government employees.'' Among those disappointments, <PERSON> Aller </PERSON> told a reporter, are the pay caps that have been imposed for several years on members of the Senior Executive Service of which <PERSON> Aller </PERSON> is a member. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last week proposed a substantial pay increase for the <ORGANIZATION> SES </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Logsdon </PERSON>, a space analyst at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, characterized the law recently as `` a sledgehammer instead of -LRB- the -RRB- scalpel it was supposed to be.'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s No. 3 official, Dr. <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinners </PERSON> resigned effective May 14 _ a day before the new law had been expected to go into effect _ citing `` uncertainty in interpretation of new post-employment laws.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, who was in charge of the effort to redesign the space shuttle's solid rocket boosters at the <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, resigned and went to work as an executive in the <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> at the Kennedy Space Center.

 A former furniture salesman testified today that former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> executives <PERSON> David </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> used a <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> credit card to pay off a $ 15,000 debt for furniture that was delivered to their <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> apartment. <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, who worked at the <ORGANIZATION> Mecklenburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Design </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> in 1985, said the Taggarts purchased more than $ 20,000 worth of furniture for their $ 640,000 one-bedroom apartment in Trump Tower. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said he went to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to set up the sofas, tables, custom area rug and chairs. The Taggarts are charged with evading $ 487,000 in federal income taxes from 1984 to 1987. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> used a credit card issue to <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> to pay off the $ 15,350 balance on the purchase. The credit card receipt introduced by <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> prosecutor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> carried a hand-written notation that the furniture was purchased for the Heritage Grand Hotel. The hotel is on the grounds of <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> theme park south of <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> also entered documents showing <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> had used his personal credit card to purchase $ 6,200 in bedroom furniture for the Taggarts' home in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>. A handwritten note on that charge slip indicated the canopy bed, mattress and armoire were to be used in the presidential suite at the Heritage Grand Hotel, the suite used by <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. On Wednesday, friends of the Taggarts testified that the two told friends their wealth came from a family inheritance. `` They told me about growing up in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, that they got an inheritance from their grandfather,'' <PERSON> Penny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollenbeck </PERSON>, who became friends with <PERSON> David </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> when they worked together at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in the early 1980s, testified for the prosecution Wednesday. Federal prosecutors say the brothers diverted $ 1.1 million of ministry funds to their personal use by taking cash advances on <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> credit cards and using blank ministry checks to pay the credit card bills. They have argued that the Taggarts lied even to their closest friends about the source of their wealth to conceal their actions. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON> <PERSON> IV </PERSON>, another former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> aide and friend of the Taggarts, said he asked <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> about his money while the two were on a trip to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in 1985. `` I believe I was blunt, I came out and asked,'' <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON> said. `` He told me he had received a trust fund from family ... I believe from his parents. It was $ 6 million _ $ 3 million each.'' Last week, testimony from the Taggarts' father, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>, established that the claims of family wealth recalled by their PTL co-workers were false. Two women who described themselves as longtime friends of the Taggarts described being taken on expensive trips to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lucinda </PERSON> <PERSON> McLellan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Darlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said the trips included $ 3,000 hotel bills, dinners costing $ 600 each and shopping sprees that cost several thousand dollars. In other testimony, a representative from a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> fur shop said the Taggarts spent about $ 35,000 on mink coats and other furs for themselves at her store. And a salesman for a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> shoe store said the Taggarts spent nearly $ 100,000 from 1982-86 on shoes for themselves. Television evangelist <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Humbard </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> board member, testified that he keeps tight spending controls at his ministry in <LOCATION> Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` Nobody in our organization is authorized to spend more than $ 10,000 outside the budget without authorization from the board of directors.'' If convicted on the tax evasion charges, the Taggarts each could be sentenced to 25 years in prison and face fines totaling about $ 1 million.

 A volcano erupted near an uninhabited island today, spewing plumes of steam and smoke into the air and raising concerns about a region of the nation where thousands of earthquakes have occurred recently. The eruption happened at 6:30 p.m. about 1 -LCB- miles northeast of the island of <LOCATION> Teishijima </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. The island is just off the coast of Ito city on the <LOCATION> Izu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, 60 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The extent of the volcanic activity several hundred yards beneath the ocean's surface was not immediately known, the agency said. There were no immediate reports of injuries, and a tsunami, or seismic wave caused by earthquakes or volcanic activity, was not expected, the agency said. However, it issued a navigation warning to ships operating in the area. Many people in <LOCATION> Ito </LOCATION>, a seaside spa known for its many hot springs, were seen leaving their homes, but no evacuation order was issued, the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said. Hundreds of people called local officials asking about the volcano. `` Right now, we do n't know if this will lead to another, larger eruption and can only tell people there to watch for further warnings,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> official who requested anonymity. `` Obviously, there could be danger to <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> if a larger eruption occurs.'' More than 20,000 earthquakes have been recorded around <LOCATION> Izu </LOCATION> over the past two weeks, and officials from the <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> began today to check movement of the earth's crust at Ito, the town nearest the epicenter <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> has a population of 72,000. Also seismologists from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> started surveying the movements of underground magma with monitoring equipment in <LOCATION> Ito </LOCATION>. The stepped-up investigations followed an emergency meeting late Wednesday of the government's <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earthquake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prediction </ORGANIZATION>, which called for `` careful monitoring'' of the continuing earthquakes. The 16-member committee, led by Professor <PERSON> Daisuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Shimozuru </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement that the successive minor quakes occurring since Tuesday night `` may be caused by activities of underground magma, and there is a need to monitor them carefully.'' Two million people visited <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> last year, where there are 450 inns and hotels for visitors, <PERSON> Hidekatsu </PERSON> <PERSON> Takei </PERSON>, acting director of the Hot Spring Tourist Cooperatives in <LOCATION> Ito </LOCATION>, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Soviets Welcome U.S. Bid to Speed Up Conventional Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> today welcomed a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort to speed up negotiations to reduce conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and said a deal might be possible within six months. `` We have no intention of delaying this important matter of reducing the level of military confrontation,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>. But he said it might be hard to meet a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration proposal to make the cuts by 1992. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed at a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit May 29 that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> reduce their troop levels to 275,000 each in central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. According to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, that would mean a reduction of 30,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and a cut by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> of more than 10 times that, or 325,000 troops. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said that in general the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> ideas `` are viewed by us as serious and constructive proposals, meeting our own proposals halfway.'' The Soviet spokesman noted that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` also proposed to conclude an agreement on conventional forces during the next six to 12 months and aim to comply with this agreement in 1991-92. `` The <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> talks, given a constructive approach, can arrive at specific agreements by next year. We will do everything to reach those agreements within six months. `` Of course, to reduce substantial numbers of personnel and material by 1992 is not an easy matter. We may suppose that the schedule proposed is an unusual one for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries and has been created mostly by political considerations,'' he said. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> did not comment on a proposal by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> to limit each side to a ceiling of 5,700 combat aircraft, of which 1,900 would be helicopters. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency, however, said the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> proposal contained some `` disturbing points,'' especially the inclusion of combat aircraft able to carry out both offensive and defensive missions. `` It is precisely strike aircraft of frontline -LRB- tactical -RRB- aviation that constitute an important component of surprise attack capability. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> has a considerable advantage in this area,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> commentator <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Chernyshev </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> also noted that Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships would pay reciprocal visits this summer in a program of expanding military cooperation. From July 21-25, the cruiser Usinov will be among the Soviet warships visiting visit <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, home of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>. From Aug. 4-6, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships will return the visit by stopping at <LOCATION> Sevastapol </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. The visits will be the first of their kind in 14 years, said <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, convicted of a murder committed when she was 15, can not be executed, the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today. The court unanimously upheld <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s conviction in the 1985 stabbing death of an elderly Bible teacher but said she should be sentenced to 60 years in prison. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s case has drawn international attention, and in 1987 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> appealed for mercy on her behalf. The court based its decision on a 1987 change in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> law raising the minimum age for a death penalty defendant from 10 to 16 and on a 1988 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision barring executions of juveniles under 16 at the time of the crime. But the court said although the law was compelling, `` this is a difficult conclusion to reach because of the gruesome nature of <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s acts.'' `` We won! I'm elated, relieved,'' said <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Touchette </PERSON>. `` I'm very happy for <PERSON> Paula </PERSON>. I'm just so relieved that this is over. It was not an easy case.'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> pleaded guilty to the stabbing death of <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelke </PERSON>, 78, a retired Bible teacher in <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>. According to court records, <PERSON> Pelke </PERSON> was stabbed 33 times after <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> and three friends broke into her home to get money and jewelry. The three other young women received prison terms ranging from 25 to 60 years for their roles in the crime. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, now 18, is an inmate at the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Women's Prison in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. Roman Catholics and some European leftist groups have adopted <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> as the figurehead of their campaign against capital punishment. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> have also pleaded on her behalf. In March an Italian group presented a petition with 1 million signatures to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> officials urging clemency for <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, and in 1987 the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> wrote to then-Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> to ask for mercy for the young woman. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> and current Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> have said they did n't want to intervene in the <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> case until the appeal was resolved. In today's opinion, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> concluded that executing <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> would be unfair because she would be the only person under 16 ever executed in the state. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, after much debate in 1987, changed the minimum age for a death penalty defendant but made it clear that <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> was n't to be affected by the change. But the court said exempting <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> from the change is inappropriate. `` Now that <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> law establishes 16 as the minimum age for the imposition of the death penalty, <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> would be both the first and last person ever to be executed in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> for a crime committed at the age of 15,'' Chief Justice <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> wrote for the court. `` This makes her sentence unique and disproportionate to any other sentence for the same crime,'' <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> wrote. The state court also said that last year's divided <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling on an <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> case signals that four justices believe `` it is cruel and unusual punishment to execute a juvenile convicted of a murder committed before the age of 16, and one justice believes it is unconstitutional to executive a juvenile unless the death penalty itself identifies a minimum age for the death penalty.'' While sparing <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> from the electric chair, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said the circumstances surrounding her crime `` clearly support the next most severe penalty under the statute, namely, the maximum sentence of imprisonment.'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> will be eligible to apply for parole after serving half of the 60-year sentence.

 Firefighters finished digging a fire lane around a blaze that burned tens of thousands of acres in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, and officials in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> tried to steer endangered trout to waters free of ash from a nearby forest fire. Crews were released from sites in several Western states Wednesday as wet weather helped firefighters bring several blazes under control. `` We have rain ... it's cooler and we've got firefighters going home. Is n't that good news?'' asked <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Merle </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, where three fires burning on more than 20,000 acres were subdued. The number of firefighters battling active blazes was expected to fall to around 5,000 today from more than 11,000 as recently as Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> reported. Firefighters were winding up work in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. `` Every fire that we have has been contained or will be contained today or Friday,'' <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON>, spokesman at the <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> center, said this morning. `` We're doing very well with the fires.'' The weather forecast also continued to be good, with more rain and higher humidity in most regions, he said. In <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, a half-inch of rain fell in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION>, helping crews fighting a 2,000-acre fire that destroyed 37 homes and damaged 19 other buildings. The blaze was contained, or surrounded, Wednesday and declared under control this morning. A 2,600-acre fire in <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> Verde National Park was controlled without damaging ruins left by 13th century Anasazi Indians. But a 2,000-acre blaze in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Poudre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION> was still to be contained, officials said, and they were n't planning on anything more than a brief respite. `` If we had two days of 98 degrees, we'd be right back where we were Sunday,'' said fire information officer <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Nesselroad </PERSON>. Officials in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> pushed back the target for containing a 2,900-acre fire in rough terrain near Big Sur to Friday evening, said <PERSON> Maeton </PERSON> <PERSON> Freel </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. More than 900 firefighters had contained a little more than half of the blaze, which investigators believe was started by an arsonist, he said. A wildfire that temporarily shut busy Interstate 15 between the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gabriel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> mountains east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> was partially contained before it could threaten a housing development, authorities said. About 100 firefighters battled the blaze in 100-degree heat and 35 mph winds. Crews in northwest <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> used heavy equipment and shovels to encircle a grass and tree fire in an area eight miles wide by 22 miles long. `` We have fully contained the fire,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>, deputy state fire marshal. `` Full control could be a couple of days and an exact estimate on burned acreage can be made after that.'' After flying over the area, <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> scaled back the size of the fire to between 50,000 and 100,000 acres from more than 100,000 acres. The <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> confirmed at least 48,000 acres had burned, he said. The lightning-caused fire destroyed 14 unoccupied structures but spared buildings in historic <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Robinson </LOCATION>, an old cavalry post where Sioux Chief Crazy Horse was killed by his jailers. The blaze burned nearly half of 22,000-acre <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robinson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, but officials planned to reopen it Friday, said state parks chief <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>. `` I'm sure we'll get some people in here out of curiosity, but this is still a beautiful place,'' he said. In southwest <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, rainfall on Tuesday washed ash from a 10,000-acre blaze in the <ORGANIZATION> Gila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> into <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION>, threatening <LOCATION> Gila </LOCATION> trout, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said. Biologists began luring the trout into a mile-long section of clear water in the creek on Wednesday and planned to transfer the fish to nearby holding areas today with helicopters and mules. Most fire crews headed home from the <LOCATION> Gila </LOCATION> fire, which was contained Monday, as well as from two fires contained Wednesday in <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Malpais </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monument </ORGANIZATION>, which burned a total of about 5,400 acres, said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Neskauskas </PERSON> of the state forestry office. In <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, firefighters hoped to contain today the last large fires, a 800-acre fire near <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Havasu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in the west-central part of the state. Others began leaving for other states still threatened by fires, and 360,000 acres in the Coconino and Apache-Sitgreaves national forests in the northern and eastern sections of the state were reopened to the public. `` We're winding down,'' said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>. In eastern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, crews began going home after the 4,500-acre <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Creek </PERSON> fire near the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> line was contained Wednesday evening. Firefighters extinguished two other fires that burned nearly 18,000 acres, but officials still battled a 100-acre fire in steep terrain in Desolation Canyon.

 Funerals for 14 people killed by an emotionally troubled farmer who went on a rampage with a shotgun will replace Bastille Day festivities in this small, close-knit village, the mayor said today. <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornier </PERSON> killed his mother and sister and wounded his father Wednesday before getting in his car and driving around shooting at everyone in his path, police said. The dead included several children. Authorities said <PERSON> Dornier </PERSON>, who is about 30, wounded nine people, including a police captain, and was himself shot and wounded before being captured. Mayor <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Clausse </PERSON>, whose 5-year-old niece was among those killed, said <PERSON> Dornier </PERSON> was believed angered by his elderly father's decision not to turn over to him management of the family farm in <LOCATION> Luxiol </LOCATION>, which is near the Swiss border He said funerals would be held Friday in this village of 128 people and the nearby communities of <LOCATION> Baumes-les-Dames </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Verne </PERSON> and Voillans. Street dances and fireworks displays scheduled in Baumes-les-Dames were canceled and will be replaced by a solemn ceremony with placing of wreaths in memory of the victims. All over <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the traditional July 14 celebrations were to be especially lively this year in honor of the 200th anniversary of the storming of the Bastille prison in the French Revolution. A French anti-hunting group called for tighter controls on firearms used by hunters, which are much easier to get than tightly regulated handguns and other weapons. The Rally of Opponents to Hunting issued a statement urging tougher laws on the possession of hunting weapons that would `` take them away from people under medical treatment and away from hunters out of season.'' The mayor's son, <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Clausse </PERSON>, said today that he was upstairs at home when Dornier drove toward him shooting. He said he shot at Dornier from an upstairs window with a rifle and wounded him, but not badly enough to stop him. `` I saw the blood spurting out of his neck,'' <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Clausse </PERSON> said. Dornier then continued on until he was finally stopped by police gunfire in the village of <LOCATION> Autechaux </LOCATION>, 1.5 miles from <LOCATION> Luxiol </LOCATION>, the mayor's son said. The mayor said 40 officers had given chase. Police said <PERSON> Dornier </PERSON> had been working on his father's farm. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Clausse </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dornier </PERSON> was known in the village to be emotionally troubled. Archbishop <PERSON> Lucien </PERSON> <PERSON> Daloz </PERSON> from the nearby city of <LOCATION> Besancon </LOCATION> was among the mourners who came to visit the makeshift chapel at City Hall where the bodies of six of the victims were laid. Besides the mayor's niece, a 10-year-old girl was also among the dead, police said. The French news agency <ORGANIZATION> Agence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France-Presse </ORGANIZATION> said a local police spokesman, whom it did not identify, called Dornier `` a huge man, solitary and wild, someone who inspires fear.'' Police at their regional headquarters in <LOCATION> Besancon </LOCATION> said the 14 were killed by buckshot. <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornier </PERSON>, the suspect's uncle, said in a telephone interview Wednesday that his nephew was `` mildly depressive. I saw him this morning, and he was very calm.'' A neighbor of Dornier, <PERSON> Marie-Therese </PERSON> <PERSON> Barraud </PERSON>, said she hid behind a wall as he fired shots into her kitchen. `` My husband, who was outside, was shot in the legs and the head. He's in the hospital,'' she said by telephone. `` I knew he was sick, he had shot at my husband once before,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Barraud </PERSON> said of Dornier. `` Our neighbors advised us not to go out in our garden.'' A young woman reached by telephone in <LOCATION> Luxiol </LOCATION> said she heard gunshots that she thought at first were firecrackers. `` Then a neighbor told me a black car was driving around the village and the driver was shooting at everybody,'' she said on condition of anonymity. `` I went to tell the mayor. I saw an old woman lying on the ground dead.'' Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> sent a telegram to the mayor of <LOCATION> Luxiol </LOCATION> offering condolences. The village is about 275 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. The mass killing was the worst in memory for <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Death tolls have been higher in similar recent attacks in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ysidro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Huberty </PERSON> shot and killed 21 people and injured 19 others at a <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurant on July 18, 1984. On Aug. 19, 1987, in <LOCATION> Hungerford </LOCATION> in southwestern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> killed 16 bystanders with an assault rifle and revolver before he was killed. Under French gun-control regulations, a license is required to buy a shotgun. Handguns and assault rifles, which are more tightly controlled, are very rare in this country.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today dismissed reports that Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is unable to meet a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> target date for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to reduce its conventional military forces. `` The idea that some Soviet spokesman yesterday said they ca n't meet these timetables _ I do n't want to believe that that's Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> speaking,'' the president said in an impromptu news conference as <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One flew to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> from a two-night stop in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, the second leg of a 10-day trip Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Starodubov </PERSON>, chief of the disarmament branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making central committee, said Tuesday that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> would not be able to meet the timetable. The Soviet official said that although <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, like the Western nations, is seeking an early agreement, `` there are realities which can not be suppressed.'' `` Experience shows that even when the principal elements are resolved, we need a considerably longer period for solving the details of the document,'' <PERSON> Starodubov </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> today, <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> provided a more tempered response, saying his country welcomed a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort to speed up negotiations to reduce conventional forces and indicated that a deal might be possible within six months. `` We have no intention of delaying this important matter of reducing the level of military confrontation,'' said <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> who was questioned about the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> proposal submitted today. But the Soviet official said reductions in `` substantial numbers of personnel and material by 1992 is not an easy matter. We may suppose that the chedule proposed is an unusual one for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries and has been created mostly be political considerations.'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> did not comment on <PERSON> Starodubov </PERSON>'s remarks Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> proposal calls for military cutbacks that would fix the same ceiling of 275,000 troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for each superpower. According to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> statistics, that would require the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to remove 30,000 troops from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> while the Soviets would have to pull out more than 10 times that, or 325,000. The proposal, which also includes deep cuts in armaments, called for reaching agreement in six months to a year, and for reductions to be carried out by 1992 or 1993. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members, seeking an early agreement at talks in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> on conventional disarmament, submitted a proposal today that specifies the types of combat aircraft it wants covered by an arms accord. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters that he is convinced that `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> knows that we're serious. Indeed we have an opportunity now to encourage him to move along faster on conventional force reduction.'' The president also said his journey to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> had been `` watched by the people of other <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> European countries and hopefully given encouragement to those who want to go the path of reform, political change, economic change.'' On the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not overhaul its policy on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> in response to political turmoil in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, a nation he said is having `` great difficulties.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> emphasized that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should go forward with elections among Palestinians in the occupied territories as a step toward peace. Amid charges that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is meddling in Israeli politics, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy is set. I am the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is a friend and will remain a friend. but I have to say what our policy is. `` I do n't think there is great heartburn here but I just want to continue to articulate what we believe,'' he said. The decision by Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc to harden its stand on peace negotiations has strained U.S.-Israeli relations. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said hard-liners are damaging prospects for Palestinian elections in the occupied lands. `` If anybody can make a case to me that the recent deliberations in that -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- party will enhance the election process, then I would say ` great.' But I am afraid that other people are looking at it and saying that what has happened does not enhance the possiblity of elections,'' the president said. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration plans to send an emissary to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to discuss <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> differences with its longtime ally, but the president said, `` there are no plans for high-level shuttle diplomacy.''

<HEAD>Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Urges Bill to Outlaw Flag Burning</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> today urged a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel to pass quickly his bill to outlaw flag burning, but other lawmakers said nothing short of a constitutional amendment would suffice. Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., said regular legislation was the best way `` swiftly and simply'' to overcome the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling last month that protected flag burning as a form of free speech `` No matter how we cut it, a constitutional amendment is going to take some time'' and leave a gap in the law during which flag burning would remain legal, <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said. A bill could take effect almost immediately, and if it still did n't meet constitutional muster, then an amendment could be pursued, he said. `` Let's heal the wound, pass the legislation and move on,'' urged <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>'s testimony came as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on constitutional law opened a series of hearings on what to do about the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling. House Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., testified in favor of the constitutional amendment supported by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` We believe there is no quick legislative fix on this issue,'' said <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, who was joined by Rep. <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, D-Miss., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said he opposed a constitutional amendment on flag burning, although he conceded most people disagreed with him. `` It is that very freedom, the right to protest even when it is offensive, that makes us different from the rest of the world,'' he said, comparing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with the current repression against protesters in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Legislative efforts short of an amendment might be impossible, he said. `` I'm not certain it is possible to draft a constitutionally solid statute,'' he said. Subcommittee chairman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif., urged his colleagues to be cautious `` The flag is sturdy, flying proudly through every fierce battle of every war and through times of social upheaval,'' he said. `` The Constitution, however, is fragile and can be amended by the votes of legislators caught up in the emotional whirlwinds of the moment.'' Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sensenbrenner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, the ranking Republican on the subcommittee, said he believed the constitutional amendment should be quickly passed and sent to the states for ratification because of the uncertainty that a statute would hold. `` If we want to heal the wounds'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision, `` we ought to make sure the patient does n't have a relapse,'' he said.

 The health gap between white and non-white Americans is widening, and closing the disparity will be tough, Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> today. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, the third member of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to address the civil rights group's national convention, spoke a day after Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. House and Urban Development Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> spoke on Monday. `` There is a large, and growing disparity in the health of our minority population and the white population,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. He said the average life expectancy was up to 74.8 years in 1986. `` But the shocking news is that, for the second year in a row, the life expectancy for black Americans declined _ falling to 69.4 years, having been 69.5 in 1985 and 69.7 years in 1984,'' he said. Those figures, and the infant-mortality rate that is twice that of whites, are `` a national tragedy,'' said <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, who is black. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration favored a plan to make Medicaid more available to infants and pregnant women and increase funding for demonstration projects on maternity care. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told delegates that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was committed to civil rights and black economic progress. Some listeners were n't impressed. `` His speech lacked any real substance,'' said <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> branch of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People. `` This administration vetoed a minimum wage bill and there is nothing kinder and gentler about that.'' The convention closes tonight with a speech by the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. In his speech to nearly 3,000 delegates Wednesday, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> did not address one of the hotter convention topics _ recent <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions that have been interpreted as setbacks for civil rights. The high court struck down contract guarantees for minority firms and made it tougher to prove bias in the workplace, while making it easier for white males to contest affirmative action. When pressed on the issue later at a news conference, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` The president does not feel that those decisions need to be overturned to advance the cause of civil rights.'' He said the president might reconsider if the impact of the rulings proves discriminatory. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was asked if the president planned to respond to the decisions affecting civil rights with a constitutional amendment like the one he proposed to counter a ruling that upheld constitutional protection for burning the American flag. `` He feels very strongly about civil rights, he's talking about civil rights, he's talking about decency,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. Earlier, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told delegates: `` I am committed and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is committed to fostering good and better relations with the civil rights community.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has met with civil rights leaders in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and held ceremonies honoring the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s legacy and observing the 25th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. He cited equal opportunity programs including the Job Training Partnership Act that he co-wrote as a senator, and educational initiatives including establishment of a $ 60 million fund during the next four years to build endowments of historically <PERSON> black </PERSON> colleges and universities. `` We are the ones who are going to give a person a job,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. On the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s decision giving states more power to regulate abortions, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he and the president wo n't take part in state-level debates on the issue. But, he added, `` both of our positions are pro-life.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also said the administration stands behind its February nomination of former <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Executive <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> to head the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s civil rights division. Groups including the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> have opposed the black Republican. <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> Executive Director <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON> said Sunday that <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> lacks the necessary legal knowledge. `` We know of the opposition of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>, and we have talked to them about that, but we stand foursquare behind <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters.

 Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout the country: July 10 <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal, on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan for federal pay raises: President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> faces a difficult task in selling <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people on his broad and generous pay raise plan for federal employees. It's not that some relief is n't probably justified overall, critical for retention of key specialists in a few areas. It's just that the federal government is low on money _ most taxpayers are too _ and the economy is slowing down to boot. Public sentiment on public salaries was demonstrated unmistakably in the congressional pay raise bloodbath earlier this year. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is proposing hikes of from 8 to 25 percent for some 7,900 top government employees, plus $ 100,000-plus salaries for a few hundred specialists with critical skills. Administration spokesmen said they had had many qualified government service candidates who could n't afford the pay cut to accept government service <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ and the voters _ should educate themselves on this situation before rejecting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal out of hand.

 July 11 The Clarion-Ledger, <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s pay plan: President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal last week to give 7,900 federal executives pay raises of 8 to 25 percent is both prudent and timely. Congressional action authorizing the increase is merited. Equally worthy of approval is the president's additional proposal to ban congressional honoraria, though he would delay it for 18 months. Honoraria should go immediately. The raise for senior government officials should have been proposed first and separately from the proposed 51 percent congressional pay raise that sank after an angry public outcry early this year. The pay of these officials has eroded significantly in comparison to comparable jobs in the private sector, and as a result, the administration says, about 40 potential executives turned down government appointments.

 July 6 The <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> Advertiser, on the sentencing of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>: <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s no-jail sentence is surprisingly light. It will do little to remind the nation of the serious wrongs of the Iran-Contra affair or to deter other gung-ho government officials from breaking the law in the name of `` following orders.'' The mild sentence is also a break for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. It will both reduce right-wing pressure for a North pardon and further eclipse bids to find out what role <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> really had in the Iran-Contra dealings. He can continue stonewalling. Few felt the former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide should have gotten the 10-year maximum sentence, but some time in custody would have dramatized the seriousness of this affair.

 July 7 The <LOCATION> Bellingham </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, on <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s sentence: Instead of throwing the book at <ORGANIZATION> Oliver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> threw a handful of the pages and expressed the hope that <PERSON> North </PERSON>, and the rest of the country, would get the message. That message is that <PERSON> North </PERSON> deserved punishment for misusing his power as a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> employee during the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages dealing, but that the punishment should fit not only the crime but the criminal. Some observers believe <PERSON> North </PERSON> got off with a wrist-slap, and should have done time in prison. Others, supporting <PERSON> North </PERSON>, believe a $ 150,000 fine and a ban from holding public office is a high price to have to pay for merely following orders. ... We probably all lack `` full understanding'' of the case, even though it was widely reported. Left undocumented, for example, was the extent of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s role in the illegal activities. But one thing <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> seemed to understand fully was that jailing <PERSON> North </PERSON> would have achieved little more than making him an unjustified martyr. Future Iran-Contra trials will help us understand more about the case and <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s role in it. Until then, the judge has relegated him to minor-player status, which is probably where history will keep him.

Given his heroic war record and his bristling performance as a super-patriot before, during and after his trial, the former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> colonel whipped up widespread sentiment against his going to prison. But it can be persuasively argued, it seems to us, that the penalties imposed by Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> were hardly commensurate with the gravity of his crimes _ fraud, lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and destruction of government documents ... At the same time _ and this no doubt was central to the judge's determinations _ he held that <PERSON> North </PERSON> was `` not ... a leader at all'' in the Iran-Contra scandal but `` really a low-ranking subordinate working to carry out initiatives of a few cynical superiors. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> obviously was referring to the late <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> MacFarlane </PERSON>, both former national security directors. Much of the American public also believes that <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, then president, was the most culpable superior ... His -LRB- North's -RRB- diehard supporters also are clamoring for a pardon. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, whose role in Iran-Contra also begs for further examination, would be well advised to ignore such sentiment lest a fresh firestorm of bitter debate sweep the country.

They came _ some 40,000 people _ and assembled in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>. The purpose of the assembly, attracting visitors from far and near, was to celebrate the most important revolution in history and to see a fireworks display which had received advance hype as the American equivalent of a royal command performance: the best in the world, because this is for the president. Then, when all was in readiness and the expectant throng stood waiting for its thrill of thrills, it is reported that <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sent word to the fireworks maestro to in effect `` start early and make it short.'' So in less than 15 minutes the anxiously awaited `` extravaganza'' was over _ to the acute disappointment of many onlookers. It's still not clear why the fireworks display was cut short. Considerations of safety to the president were cited, though it's hard to see why no one thought of that beforehand The president and Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were reported to have spent part of the next morning cleaning up after the display, so perhaps housekeeping was the issue. But since the town of <LOCATION> Kennebunk </LOCATION> canceled its fireworks show in favor of the president's, expectations were naturally high. Next year, the Bushes ought to deliver as promised, or withdraw from the extravaganza buisness.

<TEXT>
 More than a million Moslems today descended <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arafat </ORGANIZATION> and crossed a scorching plain to the holy city of <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> for prayers culminating their annual pilgrimage. This year's pilgrimage, or hajj, to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> was conducted under the guard of anti-terrorist security squads. The worshipers filed past the road in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> where two bombs exploded Monday, killing one person and injuring 16. Waves of men in white seamless robes _ signifiying equality in the eyes of <LOCATION> Allah </LOCATION> _ and women in long dresses and head scarves participated in the prayer, broadcast live via satellite to scores of countries. About 1.8 million Moslems came from more than 80 countries for the hajj, which every financially able Moslem is expected to make at least once. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> boycotted this year's hajj to protest restrictions on the number of pilgrims. Each nation was given a quota of 1,000 pilgrims per million people. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> alleged the restrictions were intended to limit the number of Iranian pilgrims. It also accused Saudi authorities of fabricating Monday's bomb incident to discredit <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The Saudis have not accused <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of planting the bombs. At twilight, the pilgrims offered the Eid Al-Adha, or Feast of Sacrifice, prayers before slaughtering hundreds of thousands of sheep, cows and camels. They then streamed down <PERSON> Mount </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to the <PERSON> Mina </PERSON> plain and on to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> for the farewell prayer before dispersing. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mina </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> are all about four miles apart. Some pilgrims walked from <PERSON> Mina </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, but most took advantage of air-conditioned buses provided by the Saudis. In traditional messages, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s King Fahd and his crown prince, <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON>, made no mention of the bombings. The king said it was a `` sacred duty'' for him as `` custodian of Islam's holiest shrines'' to complete renovation and modernization plans at <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> to provide pilgrims with better conditions for future pilgrimages. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> cited the construction under way as the main reason for curtailing the number of pilgrims. Limits on pilgrims first were imposed in 1988. The previous year, demonstrations by thousands of the 150,000-strong Iranian hajj contingent led to clashes with Saudi police. At least 402 people died, most of them Iranians. Scores of Iranians were arrested during the 1986 hajj when they tried to bring in explosives. Princes and dignitaries from <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, merchants and paupers from <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, Cossack and Tartars from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, mingled with other pilgrims from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> _ all chanting in union `` Allah <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Kabeera </PERSON>, <PERSON> Walhumdillah </PERSON> <PERSON> Katheera </PERSON>,'' Arabic for `` God is so great and to Him we pay high tribute.'' The hajj is performed during the Islamic lunar months of <LOCATION> Shawwal </LOCATION>, Zul-Quideh and <PERSON> Zul-Hijjeh </PERSON>. Similar rituals performed out of the season are called `` Umrah,'' or lesser hajj. The hajj proper is limited to six days. A pilgrim may commence the rituals at any time during the three months, but the actual congregational rites were conducted this year between July 8 and July 13. Hajis are required to pray at the Grand Mosque in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> and circle its <LOCATION> Kaaba </LOCATION>, a granite cube draped with gold-embroidered black brocade. Moslems honor the <LOCATION> Kaaba </LOCATION> as the house of <PERSON> Allah </PERSON>. As they circle the cube, pilgrims often bend to kiss the sacred black stoe set in silver on the east corner of the granite structure. The pilgrims also run back and forth seven times between <LOCATION> Safa </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Marwa </PERSON>, two hills 800 yards apart, enclosed within a huge mosque. They commemorate the agony of <PERSON> Hagar </PERSON>, <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>'s estranged wife, who ran frantically in the same spot searching for water for her son <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON>, until <PERSON> Allah </PERSON> guided her to a spring. The spring today feeds the sacred well of <PERSON> Zamzam </PERSON> in the heart of the Grand Mosque. When they go to <PERSON> Mina </PERSON>, each pilgrim throws seven stones at each of the three `` devil pillars,'' a spot where Moslems believed the devil tried to tempt <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> to disobey <PERSON> Allah </PERSON> and refuse to sacrifice his son.

 Black nationalist leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> said from prison that the white-led government can only end the bloodshed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> through dialogue with the banned <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` I would also like to confirm that my release is not an issue at this stage,'' said <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>. `` I only would like to contribute to the creation of the climate which would promote peace in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> met for 45 minutes on July 5 with President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> at the president's <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> residence, and the report fueled speculation that the man considered the leader of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 28 million blacks may soon be freed. The statement Wednesday from <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, who has been in prison for more than 26 years, was his first since 1985 that was approved by the government for public releace. `` Dialogue with the mass democratic movement, and in particular with the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, is the only way of ending violence and bringing peace to our country,'' he said. Anti-apartheid groups, which initially dismissed the talks as government propaganda, later called the meeting a positive development. For example, anti-apartheid leader <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, on Wednesday said the meeting was a `` calculated attempt by the government to make maximum political gain.'' But on Thursday, <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> said: `` I welcome Mr. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s commitment to contribute in any way possible to the creation of a climate which will promote peace in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, who is serving a life sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government, has over the years occasionally sent messages out through his lawyer and other visitors. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is the leading guerrilla group fighting apartheid, under which <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s black majority has no vote in national affairs. It is based in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> and seeks a South African state based on one man, one vote. Neither the president nor his heir apparent, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, have commented on the <LOCATION> Botha-Mandela </LOCATION> meeting. The government announced the talks in a brief statement Saturday, but nothing has been added since. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has said he wants to create conditions to free <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and has dropped his requirement that the founder of the guerrilla movement's military wing renounce violence. Instead, he has talked of political prisoners being willing to work for peace. `` There is something Oriental in the way -LRB- <LOCATION> Mandela </LOCATION> -RRB- has turned weakness into power,'' Business Day, the country's leading financial daily, said today. `` He has achieved much by doing virtually nothing, forcing his jailers progressively to ease the conditions of his release,'' the editorial added. `` It is not too much to say that the government is now the prisoner of its prisoner: it can not escape his embrace.'' In 1985, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> gave permission for a statement from <LOCATION> Mandela </LOCATION> to be read at a rally in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, the black township outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> where the black leader's family lives. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Zindzi </PERSON>, read the statement before a huge crowd. It was <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s response to <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s offer to release him if he would renounce violence. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> refused, saying <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> should renounce violence and racial segregation. `` Only free men can negotiate,'' <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> said in 1985. `` Prisoners can not enter into contracts.'' British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> was quoted Wednesday as saying <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s release is crucial. `` No black South African will accept negotiating with the government as long as <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> is in prison. ... But I believe there is now a hope of seeing him freed, although I have received no guarantee,'' she was quoted as saying in an interview with the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monde </ORGANIZATION>. The South African <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> quoted Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> as saying, `` We do not condemn the meeting at all. ... For us to get to the negotiation table, we have to start somewhere. We believe we would have to talk to the government at some stage or another.''

Legislators from the conservative <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> party claimed in Parliament that <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> will be made to pay at least $ 3.6 million in reparations.

<TEXT>
 Seeking to shock legislators into supporting a tax increase, Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> today outlined $ 491 million in cuts in the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> state budget. `` I'm today doing the worst thing I ever had to do in my political career,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said at a noon news conference, at which he blamed himself and the Legislature for the state's fiscal mess. The package of impounded funds and vetoes cuts into a $ 12.3 billion state budget for the fiscal year that began July 1. The cuts include a freezing of welfare benefits at current levels, cuts of $ 16 million in environmental affairs and $ 17 million judiciary and district attorney accounts and a reduction in state scholarship funds. The welfare move means that the state's poor receiving general relief will get no cost-of-living increase. `` All of us in state government have arrived at this unhappy moment through a combination of miscalculations, mistakes and misinformation,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` I'm disappointed in myself. I'm disappointed in the legislature I'm disappointed in all of us who have let the talkmasters and the columnists define our values, our commitment to public service, our commitment to each other.'' The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> plan includes an across-the-board reduction in administrative costs by 10 percent. `` The first 250 million hits the bone and will cause real pain,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` The balance hits raw nerve and will be devastating to people, to families and to communities. I'm doing what I'm doing today because I have to do it to avoid fiscal chaos. I ca n't let the state go down the drain financially and I wo n't.'' Key pieces of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> package of state spending reductions include: _ Total cuts in public education and higher education of $ 62 million _ A cut in the state human services budget of $ 97 million _ Reduction in the state AIDS program of $ 2 million _ A cut in Aid to Families with Dependent Children of $ 22 million _ $ 8 million from the state mental health budget. The Legislature has already given initial approval to a tax increase to balance the previous year's budget. Now the issue of a tax increase for this year looms. Using the line-item veto and his power to impound funds, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he also plans to eliminate the office of <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON> and cut two-thirds of the 2,100 additional state employees planned for in the budget, leaving prison guards as one of the few categories to be increased.

The early presentation provided `` further evidence of ... our desire to achieve early results,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Edes </PERSON>, the head of the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> delegation speaking on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference. Presenting the proposal today instead of in September, as originally planned, gives the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact time to frame a response during an eight-week recess in the talks. Negotiations broke today and resume Sept. 7. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> outlined details of the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> proposal Wednesday. He said <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> was recommending a ceiling of 5,700 combat aircraft and 1,900 combat helicopters for each alliance. The inclusion of an aircraft cutback complied with a long-standing East bloc demand. According to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> data, the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries have about 9,600 combat aircraft versus about 6,700 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> aircraft. The Western proposal is based on a blueprint for deep reductions in conventional arms and troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> first unveiled by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at an alliance summit in May and subsequently endorsed by <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called for military cutbacks that would fix the same ceiling of 275,000 troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for each superpower. According to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> statistics, that would require the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to remove 30,000 troops from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> while the Soviets would have to pull out more than 10 times that, or 325,000. The proposal also foresees deep cuts in armaments, with a proposed ceiling of 20,000 tanks for each side and reductions in combat aircraft and artillery. The decision to make the proposal was reached by a panel of senior <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> on Friday, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> said. It complied with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc appeals that the presentation be speeded up. The head of the Soviet delegation, <PERSON> Oleg </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grinevsky </PERSON>, welcomed the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> proposal but said he was `` sorry'' it did not go further. `` At first glance the proposal tabled by <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> today has no new elements,'' <PERSON> Grinevsky </PERSON>, said in a news conference. `` Rather it is a more detailed elaboration of the positions that were stated in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, and only in respect of aviation and helicopters at that,'' <PERSON> Grinevsky </PERSON> said. At a meeting in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, last weekend, leaders of the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> praised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> proposal and said an initial accord on reductions could be reached as early as next year. However, the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc summit did not produce any new concrete proposals on arms control of its own. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposal called for reaching agreement in six months to a year, and for reductions to be carried out by 1992 or 1993. In a statement issued at the end of the two-day <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> summit, the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> said, `` The situation of the negotiations is such that the first understandings may be achieved already in 1990.'' Last week, the head of the Polish delegation to the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> talks called on <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to submit the proposal before the recess rather than waiting until the third round of talks opens in the fall. The Soviet military bloc has a proposal on the table to reduce six kinds of weapons 10 percent to 15 percent below present levels by 1994, then add a further 25 percent reduction by 1997 before moving to purely defensive forces in the year 2000. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has also begun unilateral troop withdrawals from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that are to reduce the number of Soviet troops in the region by 50,000 by 1990.

 Illinois Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, the longest-serving incumbent governor in the nation, announced today he would not seek a fifth term in 1990. Near tears and with his voice wavering at times, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> told reporters that his decision was based on family and career reasons. `` My wife and daughter said they would support another term, but I was n't ready for that,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` My family and their happiness and security is the most important thing to me at this time.'' He added that he would `` enjoy the challenge of the private sector.'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> also said he might seek another government office. `` That's entirely possible,'' he said. `` I do not intend to retire from politics _ only from this office.'' The 53-year-old <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, a moderate Republican who has served 12 years, was mentioned as a possible presidential candidate early in his career and as a vice-presidential candidate last year. More recently, speculation has centered on whether <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> would leave state government to accept a federal appointment or a partnership in a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> law firm. The speculation became increasingly intense over the past few months, particularly within the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Both Secretary of State <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> and Lt. Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> are interested in running for governor, but both have said they would not challenge <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. Democratic gubernatorial hopefuls have also awaited <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s move as a guide to their own strategies <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> first burst into the national spotlight during his four-year tenure as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> from 1971-75, when he sent several prominent allies of the late Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> to prison on corruption charges. Passing up an offer to run against <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> instead claimed the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> gubernatorial nomination in 1976 and defeated a Daley-backed Democrat, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Howlett </PERSON>, by 1.39 million votes _ the widest margin in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> history. His first term lasted only two years because <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> was in the process of switching its gubernatorial elections to non-presidential election years. He was re-elected to a four-year term by another record margin in 1978 and then twice turned back challenges by Democrat <PERSON> Adlai </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> _ in 1982 by the narrowest margin in state history, and again in 1986 to become the state's only four-term governor. Though titular leader of the state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> and a key backer of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> has frequently been at odds with his fellow Republicans on fiscal and social issues. His political reputation is one of a pragmatic, non-ideological bridge-builder, evidenced by his support among traditionally Democratic groups such as organized labor and his warm relations with some conservative <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Democrats. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s most successful year in office may have been 1985, when he played a key role in passage of landmark school reform legislation, won approval of a massive infrastructure renewal program and landed the much sought-after Diamond-Star auto assembly plant. Those promising achievements gave way to frustration in his fourth term as his efforts to gain approval of a state income tax increase were blocked by <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON>. Earlier this month, he wound up signing a two-year tax increase drafted by <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON> and approved with mostly Democratic votes over the objections of <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s fellow Republicans. That set the stage for a potentially bruising battle over renewal of the tax in the months following the 1990 election.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, buoyed by his landmark visit to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, joined dozens of world leaders today for a spectacular Parisian party celebrating the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> helped kick off the festivities by helping present to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> the historic key to the Bastille fortress, birthplace of a rebellion against the French crown two centuries ago. The key, in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hands since 1790, is on temporary loan. On his way to the French capital, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> voiced hope that his tour of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> had `` given encouragement to those who want to go the path of reform, political change, economic change'' in those communist nations. The gala events preceding a summit meeting of the world's seven largest industrial democracies contrasted sharply with the president's trip to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, where he promised to help both communist nations with major economic reforms. <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, the president's national security adviser, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would encourage the summit partners to formulate their own aid programs for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. He said the idea was to create sort of a `` clearinghouse'' to avoid duplication of assistance by the summit countries: the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Also, <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would consider giving food and other commodities to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> if austerity measures add to the hardships of the Soviet bloc country. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was greeted by French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> at the inaugural bicentennial event at the Place du Trocadero commemorating the Declaration of the Rights of Man. That statement, issued in August 1789, set forth the French Revolution's aims of liberty, fraternity and equality for all people. The world leaders sat on a blue and white grandstand listening to a young man and woman who took turns reading the 17 articles of the declaration. A children's choir dressed in white sang a `` song of joy,'' played games and threw peace laurels, flowers and children's toys on the esplanade At the end of the ceremony, the leaders burst into applause as a flock of doves flew over the palace. Then, chatting amiably, they left for a lunch given by <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, who sat next to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during the ceremony. Security was tight with an estimated 30,000 police, including rooftop marksmen, guarding the summit events. Police also towed away about 1,000 vehicles as part of their ban on traffic in the main thoroughfares. Before leaving <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> for the French capital, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told Hungarian leaders that `` as your economy modernizes, you will play an even greater role in the evolution of a new <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that is whole and free.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told his Hungarian hosts, `` you are proving, here in the heartland of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, that the Rights of Man are the proper birthright of us all.'' In an impromptu news conference on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One during the flight to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his East European visit `` has been watched by the people of other <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> European countries and hopefully given encouragement to those who want to go the path of reform, political change, economic change.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also dismissed a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> spokesman's statement that Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is unable to meet a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> target date to reduce conventional military forces. And he said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not overhaul its <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace policy in response to political turmoil in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. He said that in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, `` the thing that is so impressive is the determination of all of these leaders to move towards economic freedom and political freedom.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had stressed publicly and privately that reforms, including austerity measures, are essential to building strong economies. `` There is no point going there under false colors and to try to have everything sweetness and light,'' he said. `` It's a message that it is n't going to be easy, but that's part of the message.'' The president said no one expressed disappointment over the relatively modest aid programs he proposed for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. `` I think that they understand that we are restricted in what we can do in terms of dollars ...,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> greeted each leader arriving by limousine at the ceremony site near the Eiffel Tower. The crowd in the street cheered when <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> appeared. Other guests included Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> Sese Seko of <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> and other African leaders, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Brazilian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, Mexican President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> and Uruguayan President <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON>. The French festivities features concerts, fireworks and parades. After a 40-minute meeting with <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took part in ceremonies marking the return _ actually a brief loan _ of the key to the Bastille, the site where the French Revolution began when the fortress was stormed in an uprising against the crown on July 14, 1789. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned to present the large iron key to <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> for display through July 22 at the new Bastille Opera house, adjacent to the site of the famous fortress. The key was given to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> nearly 200 years ago by the <PERSON> Marquis </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lafayette </PERSON>. Since 1797, the key has never left <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s estate in northern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Since 1858, the historic artifact has been in the possession of the <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vernon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ladies </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the private, non-profit organization that owns and operates <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s home. When the bicentennial party reaches its peak Friday, the Champs Elysee will be the site of a parade featuring Britons maching under artificial rain, Russians dancing with a bear on ice and an American band strutting backward all the way down the famed avenue. Amid extraordinary political uncertainty in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> as they struggle with democratic reforms, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> devoted the first half of his 10-day European journey to encouraging advocates of change. Aside from strong messages of moral support, he left behind packages of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid of $ 100 million for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and $ 25 million for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to spur development of private enterprise. `` Your challenge is enormous and historic: to build a structure of political change and decentralized economic enterprise on the ruins of a failed Stalinist system,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a speech Wednesday at the <ORGANIZATION> Karl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marx </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozgay </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s four communist leaders, told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the changes in his country were `` irreversible'' and added the government would `` accept the results of free elections'' set for next year and step down if defeated. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised he will press for a coordinated plan of further assistance for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> at the annual economic summit with leaders of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The summit meeting begins Friday evening and concludes on Sunday with the reading of a final communique. Aside from aid for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, major topics are expected to be environmental problems and Third World debt.

 <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> will propose a bilateral agreement with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> covering warnings on military accidents, a report said Thursday. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> began drafting the treaty two years ago and made it a high priority after a recent Soviet navy accidents off northern <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, according to the newspaper <PERSON> Klassekampen </PERSON>. `` <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> is ready to enter an agreement with the Soviets about warnings on military incidents,'' acting <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Oeyvind </PERSON> <PERSON> Nordsletten </PERSON> told the newspaper. He did not say when the pact would be presented. <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION> complained of Soviet slowness in providing warnings and details of accidents aboard two <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear submarines near <LOCATION> Norwegian </LOCATION> territory. On April 7, a Soviet submarine sank in the <LOCATION> Norwegian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. On June 26, another Soviet sub suffered a reactor breakdown off northern <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nordsletten </PERSON> said the draft treaty is similar to those the Soviets recently signed with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The treaty also would require warning when ships or aircraft from the countries approach each other, he said. There is heavy air and sea traffic off northern <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> from Soviet miltary bases on the <LOCATION> Kola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, just across the Norwegian-Soviet border. `` One example of an incident that might have been covered was when a Norwegian <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> surveillance plane was damaged by a Soviet fighter that flew too close over the <LOCATION> Barents </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> in 1987,'' he said. Last fall, the two nations agreed to inform each other of civilian nuclear accidents, such as the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear power plant disaster in 1986.

<HEAD>The Environment, East-West Relations Will Dominate Summit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The annual economic summit meeting that begins Friday will be dominated by environmental pollution and <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> relations because, this year, there's little bad economic news for the seven participants to discuss. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the leaders of the six other large, industrialized western democracies will meet through Sunday. Along the way, they will take time for lavish dinners, fireworks displays and festive parades organized by French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution. Almost as gleaming as the French celebrations has been the performance of the world's economy. In contrast to the gloom-and-doom forecasts following the October 1987 stock market crash, growth in 1988 and through the first half of this year has been stellar. Virtually all the summit nations enjoyed an acceleration of economic activity last year with total growth for the seven nations averaging 4.2 percent, the best showing in four years. Such a performance clears the way for other topics to take center stage. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, attending his first economic summit, hopes to use the meetings to assume the mantle of leader of the Western alliance on economic and environmental issues, much as he did on military matters in May with his troop reduction proposals at the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said the environment is coming on like a `` freight train'' as an international issue and leaders of the other summit nations _ <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> _ are facing growing political pressure to do something as well. The president arrived in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> after unveiling relatively modest aid proposals for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> during his history-making trip to the economically troubled nations. He looked to his summit partners for similar commitments to boost economic and democratic reforms in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` I'm going to tell them that there is dynamic change taking place in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters during the flight to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The recent turmoil in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will also be a primary topic when the seven leaders hold their discussions at a modernistic arch on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. But the talks are unlikely to produce any calls for new sanctions in retaliation for the crackdown on dissent in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Most of the Western leaders fear that any further isolation of the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government might derail economic reforms the country is undertaking. Not that there are n't economic concerns as well. Trade imbalances have begun to widen again with the threat that an unruly rise in the dollar could make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s trading woes even worse in the coming year. Inflation is on the rise, as well, although <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leaders insist that the increase is a blip and not the start of a long-term problem. There is also the seemingly intractable problem of the $ 1.2 trillion debt burden that has depressed growth in the developing world for over a decade. As for environmental concerns, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is bringing along <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> to help explain the administration's new proposals to cut carbon monoxide and the pollutants that cause acid rain. The talks also are expected to cover such topics as depletion of the ozoe layer, global warming, deforestation and ocean dumping. <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said he was expecting something of a race between the summit leaders `` to be the greenest of all on this issue.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is also looking to the summit to give a boost to his administration's Third World debt proposals. On March 10, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> unveiled a strategy emphasizing debt forgiveness and interest-rate reductions instead of simply adding new lending to the huge debt burden being carried by developing countries. The administration's desire to present the summit with an early success story got a boost over the weekend with the announcment that negotiators for the commercial banks and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> were near a bargain on a debt-reduction package for the Third World's second largest debtor. Mexican President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, one of the dozens of world leaders in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> for the bicentennial celebration, said Thursday that the negotiations were at a critical stage and urged the summit nations to back the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan. The communique that will formally end the summit is expected to endorse the overall principals of the Brady debt plan and the Japanese, who already have pledged $ 4.5 billion to support the debt-reduction effort, are coming to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> with an even larger lending program to help the Third World. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is likely to be criticized for what the other participants view as a high-handed approach taken by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to remove trade barriers by threatening stiff sanctions against nations that fail to remove trade barriers <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> finds onerous. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a pre-summit press conference, defended his targeting of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> for possible sanctions if talks on eliminating barriers do not produce results. While the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit narrowed for the first time in seven years in 1988, there is concern that the rising dollar, which makes American products less competitive overseas, will halt the improvement with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deficit still at record levels. The summit countries, beginning in 1987, have tried to coordinate their economic policies in such a way as to keep the dollar's value on foreign currency markets within narrow ranges. But earlier this year, despite those efforts, the dollar broke through the upward boundaries, leading some to question whether the economic coordination process was in need of a drastic overhaul. However, just in recent weeks, the dollar finally fell back within the accepted ranges, taking the pressure off the summit leaders to come up with any significant new agreements aimed at dollar stabilization. With the economy now in a record seventh year of peacetime expansion, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the other summit countries are not anxious to embark on broad new initiatives. `` Nobody should be mistaken about the fact that we have very, very good economic conditions around the world,'' he said. `` So let's not try and fiddle with the controls too much when you've got that kind of backdrop.''

<HEAD>Group Says US Lacks Comprehensive Controls on Toxic Runoff</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The nation needs a comprehensive plan for controlling poison runoff into waterways from city streets, farms, mines and other sources, an environmental group said Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said some state and local governments have taken effective measures to reduce the pollution, but the problem is growing worse in many areas because of inadequate national standards. `` Poison runoff is the leading source of pollution of at least half of the nation's rivers, lakes and coastal waters, yet this problem has received a small fraction of government funds and attention,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Adler </PERSON>, director of the group's clean water project. <PERSON> Adler </PERSON> said the runoff, containing poisonous quantities of lead, zinc, copper, phosphorus and agricultural pesticides and other toxic substances, poses a `` potentially major'' health hazard for swimmers and fish and other wildlife. This runoff has been more difficult to control than water pollution from factories and sewage treatment plants because it is diffuse and is given less federal attention, he said. <PERSON> Adler </PERSON>'s group announced the publication of a book, based on two years of study of poison runoff, that provides case studies of ways to combat the problem. Among its conclusions is that farms are the single largest contributor to the problem because of the use of fertilizers and pesticides that pollute surfrace and ground water, soil erosion that carries excess nutrients and soil particles into rivers and streams and pollution from livestock. `` We're going to have to start thinking about regulating farmers,'' <PERSON> Adler </PERSON> said. The book also said logging, mining, grazing, and construction also contribute to the problem.

 A bomb exploded today outside a discotheque patronized by American military personnel, wounding seven <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers, three of them seriously, officials said. The attack occurred shortly after midnight at <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ceiba </LOCATION>, more than 200 miles north of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. There was no claim of responsibility. It was the fourth attack on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> since Feb. 1. Three soldiers were injured in the previous incidents. Today's victims were Army military police, who were in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ceiba </LOCATION> to act as escorts for about 150 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers taking part in a joint road-building exercise with Honduran troops, <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON> said. He said the entire group was due to leave <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ceiba </ORGANIZATION> today. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> deputy spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said the explosive was thrown as the Americans left a disco. <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON> could not confirm that. `` We do n't know if the explosive device was hurled from a passing automobile or had been detonated in place,'' <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON> said. He said the device exploded outside a discotheque. The injured soldiers were part of a group of nine who had been given a night's leave and were in civilian clothes. Two uninjured soldiers fled and were arrested by Honduran troops because they had no identification, a Honduran military commander said. <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON> said three of the wounded soldiers were in serious condition, while the other four suffered lesser injuries. He said all were assigned to the <LOCATION> Enrique </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Soto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cano </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, 50 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, a major center for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The wounded soldiers were rushed to a private hospital in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ceiba </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON> said. Their names were not released. Col. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said the uninjured Americans were being held until they could be officially identified by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, the Honduran military commander at <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ceiba </LOCATION>, said the attack occurred at 12:30 a.m. and involved a `` homemade explosive device.'' <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON> said the troops were part of a convoy that had been building roads in a province 120 miles east of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ceiba </LOCATION>. The convoy had stopped for the night during its trip back to <PERSON> Soto </PERSON> <PERSON> Cano </PERSON>. About 15,000 American troops and Honduran soldiers were taking part in an exercise called Strong Roads that began in December and ended Tuesday. The exercise involved bringing in troops from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> a few hundred at a time for road-building. At least 20 American soldiers have been wounded in attacks in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> since 1982, when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> started increasing its military presence in this country and holding joint exercises with Honduran troops. Today's attack came three months after unidentified assailants used gunfire and an explosive to attack a jeep convoy carrying 11 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and six Honduran soldiers outside <LOCATION> Olanchita </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ceiba </LOCATION>. One jeep was disabled in the April 11 attack, but no injuries were reported. A shadowy leftist group calling itself the <ORGANIZATION> Morazanista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for the attacks earlier this year and for attacks in 1983 and 1987. Since 1982, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> have carried out around 80 military exercises jointly, involving a total of 100,000 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers, under a 1954 reciprocal military assistance treaty. The exercises were intended partly as a political signal to the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, which borders <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to the south. Some elements of the Honduran population strongly resent the increased <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military role in the Central American nation, as well as the use of Honduran territory by the Contra rebels battling the leftist government in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> was used by the U.S.-supported Contras in their attacks on Sandinista forces. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the Contras was cut off about 17 months ago, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance to the Contras has been limited to humanitarian aid. Thousands of Contras still live in the border area, but fighting has declined substantially as a result of a cease-fire agreed to in March 1988.

<HEAD>Foreign Travel Agents Seek Discounts, Chinese Promotion Help</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Foreign travel agents Thursday urged <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to end martial law in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, lower prices and mount a public relations campaign abroad if it wants to lure back tourists scared by the crackdown on pro-democracy protests. One after another, travel agents told Chinese tour officials their ideas for salvaging what both sides had expected to be a lucrative summer season. `` We need very practical solutions and we need them very quickly,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Spreadborough </PERSON> of Silk Route Travel in <LOCATION> Melbourn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. `` We may have lost the entire 1989-90 program. We've invested heavily in promoting <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The return will be zero for most of us.'' His suggestion, echoed by many other agents, was for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to invest in overseas tour promotions, something <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> does not normally do. `` They want people to come in _ they have to go outside,'' <PERSON> Spreadborough </PERSON> said. `` Our problem is destination credibility. We know it's safe but until there is some sizeable effort from big guns in <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> tourism, we're fighting an uphill battle.'' <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> of Pacific Delight Tours in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, said his company lost hundreds of thousands of dollars on promotional material for now-canceled <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> tours. `` We want our Chinese friends to share the risk and the profit,'' he said, calling on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to help fund an advertising campaign. Some travel agents said they still planned to bring in groups in September, although July and August tours were canceled. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Woo </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Amerasia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> predicted that if the Chinese get 30 percent of what they had last year, `` they'll be in good shape.'' More than 4.3 million tourists visited <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1988 on organized tours alone, and several times that many are estimated to have come individually. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> reaped $ 2.2 billion in hard currency in a major boost to the country's development program. But since the army shot its way into <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on June 3-4, killing hundreds and possibly thousands of civilians, tourism has nearly halted. When 16 foreigners arrived in the eastern province of <LOCATION> Jiangxi </LOCATION> on Thursday, local officials gave them a ceremony and welcomed them as the first foreign visitors in two months, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> decided two weeks ago take emergency action, and invited about 400 tour agents from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries for a two-day, all-expenses-paid seminar. At the conference's end, the director of the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bo </PERSON> <PERSON> Xicheng </PERSON>, promised that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would give 20 percent discounts to foreign tour groups `` in the near future or at least before the end of the year,'' <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said. Some cities' branch offices of the national tour agency also have announced price cuts, according to the Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newsletter </ORGANIZATION>. Individual hotels in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> have begun charging their off-season rates. However, under an austerity program imposed by the government to counter inflation and other economic problems, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s state-run tour organizations may not have the money to conduct the large-scale promotion the agents demanded. Instead, they concentrated on winning over the travel agents. Tour workers from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and other cities pressed their name cards and glossy brochures into as many hands as possible, and some gave out gifts of sandalwood fans and tea. The Chinese also handed out political promotional material: copies of a government report that condemned the student-led protests and booklets with pictures of soldiers' burned and beaten bodies. For $ 8, the tour agents could buy a government videotape called `` The True Story of the Turmoil,'' with footage of civilians attacking soldiers. The video, a compilation of footage shown on Chinese TV, does not show any violence by soldiers against civilians. Some tour agents defended <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s action, while others privately expressed anger and sorrow. But all agreed that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> must either lift martial law or reduce the military presence before large numbers of tourists will return. One suggested putting soldiers on the streets only at night. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Holi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> Tours in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> said soldiers should be told to take their fingers off rifle triggers and `` smoke a cigarette or drink a <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> in order to ease the tense situation.'' Added <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s Spreadborough: `` Australians find it unacceptable for soldiers to have guns on the street. It makes them jittery. Australians are used to taking vacations on beaches, and you do n't find men with guns on beaches.''

<TEXT>
 A German-speaking man wounded a policeman in a shootout today, took a woman hostage in her home, and demanded that authorities bring him heroin and his West German girlfriend, police said. The man, whose name was not known, broke into the house of the 52-year-old woman around 2:30 a.m. after exchanging gunfire with police and slightly injuring one officer, said police spokesman <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Naberhuis </PERSON>. A radio report said he is West German. The kidnapper demanded a supply of heroin and that his West German girlfriend be allowed to join him, <PERSON> Naberhuis </PERSON> said. Police gave him some heroin and his girlfriend was being interviewed at police headquarters in this southern Dutch city near the West German border. `` I do n't know whether she wants to join him at all,'' <PERSON> Naberhuis </PERSON> said. He said the confrontation began when the man broke into a nearby house known to police for its connections with heroin trafficking, he said. A woman living there alerted police who were fired on six times when they arrived. The suspect then fled into another house, where he seized his hostage. <LOCATION> Heerlen </LOCATION> is known for its relatively large population of Dutch and West German drug abusers.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee voted today to launch its own investigation of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, as a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel said it has voted to strip money from a rehabilitation program at the heart of the burgeoning scandal involving the agency. Although Housing Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> has said he would not sacrifice programs for the poor to cure the problems he inherited, a House Appropriations subcommittee voted earlier this week to deny money in the fiscal 1990 budget year for the Moderate Rehabilitation Program. `` It was a program shot full of fraud and abuse,'' subcommittee chairman Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Traxler </PERSON> said today in xplaining the panel's action `` It's time we step back and determine what fixes may be necessary.'' <PERSON> Traxler </PERSON>, D-Mich., said the decision was neither `` irrevocable'' nor `` permanent'' because the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> traditionally had allocated money for the program despite its omission from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration budget requests <PERSON> Traxler </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, like its predecessor, also made no provision for funding the <ORGANIZATION> Moderate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> in its proposed budget for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. `` I will not predict what the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s view of this will be,'' he said. Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the ranking Republican on <PERSON> Traxler </PERSON>'s subcommittee, said the panel will direct <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, in an upcoming report, to write regulations prohibiting the use of consultants in any future use of the $ 200 million in unspent <ORGANIZATION> Moderate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> funds The little-noticed vote on Tuesday made the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Program the first casualty of the series of internal <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> investigations and congressional inquiries into widespread influence-peddling, mismanagement and corruption at the department during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted today to begin its own investigation of the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> scandals. An investigation already was under way by a House Government Operations subcommittee. The panel will look at `` management and other activities'' in connection with the Moderate Rehabilitation Program, the use of government co-insurance and income tax credits between 1978 and 1988. The committee also voted to send the nomination of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s general counsel to the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for confirmation. The panel's vote follows two days of intensive questioning of <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> by two <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panels about the future of several of the agency's troubled programs <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> assured worried members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that he acted within his authority in suspending some programs amid allegations of influence-peddling and mismanagement. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday questioned <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s legal authority to suspend programs and warned him not to use scandals at his agency to eliminate programs for low - or middle-income Americans `` I wish to emphasize once again, we are the committee that authorizes programs, makes the changes in them, or terminates them,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Saying he has suspended rather than terminated programs, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> replied that he will submit a legal analysis supporting his authority to act. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said Thursday he was `` confident'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> had authority to cancel the Title X Land Development Mortgage Insurance program which was the focus of the panel members' questions. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> pledged not to allow problems at the housing agency to be used as a `` subterfuge'' to eliminate programs. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today that auditors have determined that losses in the department's <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> will reach $ 1 billion, twice the previously estimated figure, largely because of losses in the `` co-insurance'' program. Under that program, private insurers assume responsibility for 20 percent of the insurance for the department's mortgages. The newspaper said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has begun to look into the affairs of <ORGANIZATION> DRG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, once the largest co-insurer but now suspended from the program. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> has in recent months suspended or revised several federal housing programs after allegations by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general and others that they were riddled with abuse, mismanagement, influence-peddling and favoritism. Much of his time since taking over the agency six months ago has been spent answering questions about possible abuses during the eight years of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` I do not want to be known as the secretary who abandoned the needs that people have,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. `` Your good intentions are not questioned here, but the tools you use to respond to these scandals must be reviewed by us,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, told <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Wednesday </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hearing. `` We need to know where you are going with the termination of programs,'' added Rep. <PERSON> Chalmers </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>. Several committee members expressed concern that program cancellations would harm poor people in their districts. `` The national scandal is the tip of the iceberg,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>. `` There are some local scandals.'' In one such case, 13 people were indicted in <LOCATION> Hauppauge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, Wednesday on state charges of fraudulently obtaining funds from a federally subsidized program that made houses available to poor families. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> also pledged to curb the use of consultants on <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> subsidized projects. Several congressmen have introduced legislation to limit the role and fees of consultants in such projects, and to require full disclosure of the use of consultants. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said he will seek to revoke waivers granted by the Office of Government Ethics to the post-employment lobbying restriction for 58 senior jobs at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> in an effort to close the revolving door between government agencies and private firms that do business with them. In April, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> suspended 1989 funding for the moderate rehabilitation program after an inspector general's report said projects were chosen as the result of influence-peddling and favoritism for former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> and other government officials who received big fees as developers and consultants.

 Tropical Storm <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> has swirled to life, packing 40 mph winds but posing no immediate threat to land, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said today. At noon EDT, the center of the storm was near latitude 24.5 north, longtitude 55.5 west, or about 675 miles northeast of the northern <LOCATION> Leeward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Lesser </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antilles </LOCATION>. That was precisely the same position the storm held six hours earlier. Satellite pictures indicated <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> became nearly stationary during the night, forecasters said. Some strengthening was expected before tonight, but the storm's steering currents have diminished and its movement was expected to be slow and erratic. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, which had been moving northwest, turned sharply to the north Wednesday night and posed no immediate threat to land, said forecaster <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerrish </PERSON> at the National Hurricane Center in suburban <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>. The storm formed as a depression earlier this week off west <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. It became the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricane season's second named storm when its maximum sustained winds reached 39 mph Wednesday. If winds reach 74 mph, it would become the first hurricane of the June-November season. The season's first named storm was <PERSON> Allison </PERSON>, which caused widespread flood damage in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> last month.

 <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, taking time out Thursday from the festive French bicentennial celebration, inaugurated a wing at the American Hospital with an extemporaneous speech _ an informal touch recently adopted by the first couple. `` I had a long speech here but I learned something from my husband,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the audience as she tore up her prepared remarks. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had done the same in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> on Tuesday as a courtesy to the crowd standing in the rain. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opened the new <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gould </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pavilion </LOCATION> and high-tech medical center at the hospital, which is located in a posh Parisian suburb. `` This is the most wonderful thing that's ever happened to me,'' she said. `` You've stretched my life a little bit. I'm on a plaque.'' The plaque, which notes the inauguration, will be hung at the hospital. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, which Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> toured for 30 minutes, includes the new <ORGANIZATION> C.V. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Starr </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the first facility in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> with a communications network for teaching and diagnostics link directly to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Before leaving the podium, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> bent down to shake the hands of four children, out-patients at the facility, who presented her with a silver cup and a spiral-notebook style cookbook written by Americans living in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Earlier, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> joined her husband and about 30 world leaders at a reading of the Declarations of the Rights of Man, the 1789 document that set forth the French Revolution's aims of liberty, equality and fraternity. The Bushes later took part in the presentation of the key to the Bastille prison. The key, given to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> nearly 200 years ago by the <ORGANIZATION> Marquis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lafayette </ORGANIZATION>, is on temporary loan to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> for the bicentennial celebration.

<TEXT>
 The West made a new proposal Thursday on reducing conventional arms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, acting two months ahead of schedule in an attempt to hasten agreement. A Soviet delegate said it contained nothing new. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> welcomed the effort to speed negotiations and said a deal might be possible within six months. `` We have no intention of delaying this important matter of reducing the level of military confrontation,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>. He added, however, that it might be difficult to meet a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration proposal to make the actual cuts by 1992. He said the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> ideas, in general, `` are viewed by us as serious and constructive proposals, meeting our own proposals halfway.'' Negotiators for the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> offered the proposal on the last day of second-round talks on reducing conventional forces, giving the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> an eight-week recess to study it. This provided `` further evidence of ... our desire to achieve early results,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Edes </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> delegation, told a news conference on behalf of the Western alliance. <PERSON> Oleg </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grinevsky </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> delegation, said agreement by 1990 `` seems quite possible ... if all sides are agreeable.'' He welcomed the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> plan, but said he was `` sorry'' it did not go further. `` At first glance the proposal tabled by <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> today has no new elements,'' <PERSON> Grinevsky </PERSON> said. `` Rather, it is a more detailed elaboration of the positions that were stated in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, and only in respect of aviation and helicopters at that.'' The Western suggestion is based on a blueprint for deep reductions in conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> presented by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit in May and endorsed by the alliance. Including combat aircraft and helicopters met a longstanding demand of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. <PERSON> Edes </PERSON> said the West initially opposed including aircraft because their mobility posed verification problems in a zone stretching from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> mountains. Because of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s concession on the point, he said, its `` political will to achieve agreement ca n't be doubted.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> would put a ceiling on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet troops in the reduction zone of 275,000 each. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> said that would mean removal of 30,000 American soldiers and a cut by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> of 325,000. It also called for deep cuts in armaments, with equal limits on tanks, personnel carriers and artillery. The proposal submitted Thursday also includes limits on the number of combat aircraft and helicopters, and provides for destruction of equipment withdrawn. <PERSON> Edes </PERSON> said destroying the hardware was a new element and would require detailed verfication procedures. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> revealed the figures to journalists Wednesday in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> proposes equal ceilings of 5,700 on combat aircraft and 1,900 on combat helicopters. According to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact has about 9,600 combat aircraft and the Western alliance about 6,700. <PERSON> Edes </PERSON> said the new levels would `` adequately safeguard defensive needs of either side.'' Western delegates would not give the precise numbers of various armaments that would have to be removed from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` Precise figures will emerge in the course of negotiations,'' <PERSON> Edes </PERSON> said. `` The numbers game is not very fruitful at this stage.'' Accompanying the Western proposal were definitions of types of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> aircraft included in the proposal. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ledogar </PERSON>, the chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegate, said <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> wanted comparisons on the basis of aircraft capabilities, which he called a `` look alike, count alike'' policy. <PERSON> Grinevsky </PERSON> criticized the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> idea of reducing all combat aircraft. He said the suggestion that defensive systems be included was `` totally at odds'' with an agreement that first-stage reduction cover only offensive armaments. Asked about Western concern that defensive aircraft could be modified for strike capability, he said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would be `` ready to invite inspectors'' and even to have `` permanent inspector teams to verify that there is no cheating.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> has a proposal on the table to reduce six kinds of weapons 10 percent to 15 percent by 1994, with a further 25 percent reduction by 1997 and a move to purely defensive forces three years later. <PERSON> Grinevsky </PERSON> complained about the lack of verification procedures in the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> proposal. Western delegates said measures on verification and related issues remained to be worked out. <PERSON> Ledogar </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> `` will will be working hard ... to have the full proposal on the table at the next round,'' scheduled to begin Sept. 7. He called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s original one-year timetable for an agreement `` perfectly realistic.''

 Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> did n't get favored treatment from banks that loaned him $ 1.6 million for his unsuccessful run for the Democratic presidential nomination, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday.

 The revolutionaries who stormed the hated Bastille prison on July 14, 1789, found only seven inmates to free, locked up not for their politics but for fraud, incest and lunacy. The structure, built in the 14th century to defend <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> against English attackers, had earlier held such famous prisoners as <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fouquet </PERSON> _ believed to be `` The Man in the Iron Mask,'' _ the poet <PERSON> Voltaire </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Marquis </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Sade </PERSON>. By 1784, the <PERSON> Bastille </PERSON> was due to be demolished, but five years later it was still being used as a prison and as a rest home for 82 retired soldiers. On the fateful day of July 14, bread in the bakers' shops of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> reached its highest price in a year, and the old fortress became the target of hungry workers from the adjacent <LOCATION> Faubourg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antoine </LOCATION> district. Some accounts suggest the crowd feared they would be caught between the heavy naval guns mounted in the Bastille's 75-foot towers and regiments of the king's cavalry. Leaders of the 3,000-strong gathering asked the garrison for gunpowder and arms. When they were refused, the crowd, reinforced by the unemployed from <LOCATION> Montmartre </LOCATION> and with army deserters, attacked, crying `` The Bastille for us! Troops out!'' The cannon in the towers had alarmed the attackers, but there were no cannonballs or shot. The garrison of 32 Swiss Guards had only an assortment of light rifles. Still, about 170 people were killed in the action, and 115 wounded on both sides. The marquis <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Launey </PERSON>, governor of the Bastille, was taken away and murdered on the way to City Hall. The attackers opened the dungeons to find seven prisoners: <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Bechade </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Larouche </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Courrege </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Jean-Antoine </PERSON> <PERSON> Piyarde </PERSON>, imprisoned for fraud; a Monsieur <PERSON> Tavernier </PERSON> and the Comte de <PERSON> Whyte </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Malleville </PERSON>, both mentally deranged; and the Comtes de Solages, imprisoned for incest. The edifice was then set afire, and the traces of the blaze are still visible, burned into the walls of a canal that runs through the fortress' foundations. Soon afterward, the Bastille was demolished. Some stones were sold as souvenirs and others were used in the construction of the Concorde bridge over the <LOCATION> Seine </LOCATION> in 1790. July 14 was declared <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s National Day in 1880, 91 years after the prison fell.

 Cuban war hero <PERSON> Arnaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> and three other former army officers were executed by firing squad today for shipping tons of drugs into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the official Cuban news agency said. The executions ended a court-martial and appeal process that revealed a ring in the army and <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> engaged in drug trafficking, black marketeering, smuggling and other crimes. The <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latina </ORGANIZATION> news agency said the four were executed at dawn in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. In addition to <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, a former army general, they included former Col. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Guardia </PERSON> <PERSON> Font </PERSON>; former Maj. <PERSON> Armado </PERSON> <PERSON> Padron </PERSON>; and former Capt. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. They were sentenced to death last week, stripped of their military ranks and thrown out of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, 57, fought in the guerrilla war that brought <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> to power and was made a Hero of the Revolution, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s highest honor, for heading <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s 50,000-man expedition in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and an earlier one to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> also headed a mission to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government The defendants appealed their sentences to the Council of State. The council's 29 members voted unanimously Sunday to uphold the death sentences. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, giving a five-hour summation to the panel, said the four must face a firing squad to restore faith in the Cuban revolution, ensure discipline in the armed forces and set an example for others. In addition to drug trafficking, they were convicted of treason and other crimes. The court-martial also handed out prison sentences ranging from 10 years to 30 years to 10 other defendants in the case. They were stripped of rank and decorations and were dishonorably discharged. The scandal shook <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s government, embarrassing him and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He had for years been denying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> accusations his nation was being used for drug shipments, saying the reports were a plot to embarrass the revolution. But he had to admit the accusations were true. In addition to the officers put on trial, the transportation and interior ministers have been sacked, and there have been unconfirmed reports that other officials were arrested. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said the drug scandal did immense internal damage, eroded <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s international image and crippled the tourism industry it has been trying to foster. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of trying to score propaganda points on the drug trafficking issue. He also said <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> had stolen from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, and he held him responsible for defeats suffered by <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> forces supporting the government of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> against South Africa-supported guerrillas. Instead of sharing information on drug smuggling, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> engaged in a propaganda campaign to discredit <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, its communist revolution and his younger brother, Defense Minister <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> Deputy spokesman, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>, said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration did not have access to all the evidence in the case and therefore can not make a judgment about the executions. `` With regard to policy, we, of course, support vigorous prosecution of alleged drug traffickers whoever they may be,'' he said. As for the possibility of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cooperation with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, as suggested by <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is waiting to see what <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> will do `` in terms of efforts to combat drug-related activity that still continues.'' `` You do n't automatically start negotiating cooperation until you have an indication the other side is really serious. And that's what we're looking for,'' he said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel Thursday approved a $ 127 million bill to pay for 700 additional District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> police in an effort to stem the burgeoning murder rate in the nation's capital. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> already has approved the plan for the federal government to pick up the tab for the extra officers. By Thursday, 229 people had been killed in the district this year, compared with 159 at the same time in 1988. A record 372 people were killed last year. Police blame more than 60 percent of the slayings on drugs. Before the Governmental Affairs committee approved the five-year plan, Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., said he might introduce an amendment requiring the city to pay for part of the program The city already has agreed to pay about $ 2 million in recruiting and training costs. However, <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> may drop plans to have the city pay for the officers if he's convinced the district is also making efforts to hire police, said <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustitus </PERSON>. The city is adding 200 officers in the current fiscal year, while 300 more are to be hired in the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1. The panel also approved an amendment by Sen. <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa., that requires the city to share routine arrest information and other police data with the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and other federal law enforcement groups Because of a 1968 law establishing a balance of power between the federal and local police departments, the district is the only jurisdiction in the nation not to share such information.

<HEAD>Proposed Soviet Law on Emigration Boosts Applications</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A proposed liberalization of emigration laws has nearly quadrupled the number of Soviets seeking to settle in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Thursday. About 33,000 Soviets moved to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1988. This year, Soviets are registering their intent to emigrate at an annual rate of 120,000, and that could reach a quarter-million by 1990, said <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, consul-general at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has a policy of giving all Soviets who seek to emigrate to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the chance to do so,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. `` That dates back to a very recent time when we were engaged in a major human rights struggle with Soviet officials to free up emigration. They are doing so at rates that we did not expect but are delighted to see.'' `` I think that once the new emigration law comes into effect and a pattern is established, it could double next year and come awfully close to a quarter million,'' he said. That many Soviet emigres could overwhelm the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigration system, since 200,000 would approximately equal the number allowed into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from rest of the world, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. `` That creates an imbalance that we are going to take a good hard look at from a policy perspective,'' said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. `` The policy is under review <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' by the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said if the Soviets enact the proposed changes in their emigration law, he will urge <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pass a one-year waiver of the Jackson-Vanik amendment, thereby reducing the tariffs on Soviet goods exported to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The law, passed in 1972, was sponsored by the late Sen. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and then-Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanik </PERSON> Soviet officials involved in drafting the liberalized emigration law want it enacted as speedily as possible, said <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Reshetov </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> human rights department. `` The draft law ... establishes freedom of entry and departure. Exit or entry on a permanent or temporary basis will be free,'' <PERSON> Reshetov </PERSON> told a news conference. `` The law is on par with international practice in this area.'' The key change will be dropping the requirement that Soviets seeking to emigrate obtain an invitation from an immediate family member abroad. Instead, Soviets will need only an invitation from a friend, relative or commercial enterprise saying the emigre will be supported, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials familar with drafts of the law. The draft addresses two other often-criticized points in the law, which deny visas to people who have conducted classified research and require would-be emigres to secure statements from relatives that they leave behind no outstanding financial obligations, <PERSON> Reshetov </PERSON> said. Terms of secrecy will expire after five years, and the cases of so-called `` poor relatives'' will be handled by family courts, he said. Foreign Ministry officials have tried to impress upon members of the new legislature, the Supreme Soviet, `` the necessity of the speedy adoption of this law,'' <PERSON> Reshetov </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consul-general said Soviet citizens were lining up for visas in anticipation of the new legislation. Of the 33,000 Soviet citizens who entered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1988, said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 20,000 first went to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on Israeli visas and then on to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and the remainder went directly on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> documents. So far in 1989, Soviets are registering with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials at the rate of 60,000 a year, and at the same rate at the <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, which handles consular affairs for the Israeli government. In any recent week, he said, 1,200 to 1,500 Soviets registered at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, of whom 40 percent were Armenian, 25 percent Jewish, 15 percent ethnic Russians, 5 percent to 8 percent Ukrainians and 5 percent Balts. Others were Azerbaijani, Turkish, Georgian or Tadzhik or another nationality. Of the comparable number that register weekly at the <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> for Israeli visas, he said, about 95 percent are Jewish.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Thursday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not relax its policy on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> to accommodate political turmoil in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, a nation he said is beset by `` great difficulties.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, talking with reporters on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One as he flew here from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should go forward with elections among Palestinians in the occupied territories as a step toward peace. And he said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not change its policy of opposing Israeli settlements in the occupied territories. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> view is that such settlements are obstacles to peace. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comments reflected the strain in U.S.-Israeli relations caused by the July 5 decision by Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc to harden its stand on conditions for <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace negotiations At a press conference in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, the president's national security adviser, drew a distinction between the decision of the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> party and the Israeli government `` What <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> does is a party matter and what we deal with is the Israeli government,'' he said. <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said the purpose of a planned visit to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation was `` just to ascertain in the wake of the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> conference whether or not there has been a change in Israeli government policy.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the delegation would not be part of any high-level diplomacy. Amid charges in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is meddling in Israeli politics, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters: `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy is set. I am the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is a friend and will remain a friend but I have to say what our policy is. `` I do n't think there's great heartburn here but I just want to continue to articulate what we believe,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I want to see things go forward in terms of the peace process over there. And we want to see the election process go forward. `` And if anybody can make a case to me that the recent deliberations in that -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- party will enchance the election process, then I would say ` great.' But I am afraid that other people are looking at it and saying that what has happened does not enhance the possiblity of elections.'' Rejecting suggestings that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is rattled by developments in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I do n't know that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is so shook up but they -LRB- <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and his allies -RRB- know the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> policy and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> policy on settlements has not changed and it is not going to change. `` We might as well be frank with our friends because that is what friendship is about,'' the president said., He said, `` They have great difficultes inside of <LOCATION> israel </LOCATION> I understand that. I understand the political pressures but I ca n't be varying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy everyday to accommodate political change. I am not going to do that.''

 Much more than cold hard cash, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> left behind hin in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> the shining symbol of an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that cares about the people of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as they struggle through a trial period of transformation from Marxist to market economies. He did it with his earnest presence, by neither overpromising <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support nor encouraging a backlash from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` We were not there to poke a stick in the eye of Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>,'' said the obviously pleased president as he chatted with reporters Thursday aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One on the way to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. `` Just the opposite,'' he said. His aim was `` to encourage the very kind of reforms that he -LRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> -RRB- is championing _ and more reforms.'' Reflecting Thursday on the uniformly friendly reception he received in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters on Air Force One: `` I think it shores up their desire for change because I think it shows all of us the genuine affection for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that exists in these countries.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s message to the leaders and people of the two countries as they transit this wrenching period of change was that they have, in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a new partner to lend a hand. Clearly, however, the modest aid packages <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> outlined are not enough to put either <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in the capitalist column. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is reeling under 100 percent inflation annually. Running against global trends, the average life span in the country has declined to 65 years. Pollution is heavy. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, the showcase of socalism, has an inflation rate of at least 20 percent a year. The poverty line is $ 52 a month and, according to research by the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>, 40 percent of Hungarians fall under it. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> acknowledged on his flight here to a seven-nation economic summit meeting that the aid packages, including a $ 100 million developmment fund for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and a $ 20 million fund for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, were inadequate to rescue the economies. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that in his `` very frank'' talks with Polish and Hungarian leaders he found `` they understand we are restricted in what we can do in terms of dollars _ of aid, or dollars of support for some very worthy project.'' Even <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, the leader of the Polish union Solidarity, backed away from his quest for $ 10 billion in aid. As it turned out, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told him over lunch in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> on Tuesday that Solidarity was seeking loans from international banks amounting to $ 10 billion _ not direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> help. Earlier, a spokesman for the Polish government, Col. <PERSON> Wieslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Gornicki </PERSON>, complained that there was `` very little concrete material'' in what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> offered. He specifically noted the president's repeated calls for further sacrificies. Two years ago, the Poles refused to kick out the props from a government support system that makes rent and food staples cheap. <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, the president's national security adviser, did say here on Thursday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be ready to ease <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> through an austerity period with food aid and other commodities. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also plans to ask the leaders of the other six nations at this economic summit _ <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to help out _ in what <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> called a `` clearinghouse'' effort to avoid duplicating aid.

 A small plane with a stricken pilot ran out of gas and crashed into the ocean today after flying hundreds of miles on autopilot. Astonished rescuers said the man swam toward them and was pulled alive from the water. The pilot, identified as a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, lawyer, was taken by helicopter to <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, and will be flown by jet to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The words you keep hearing are: ` You're kidding,''' said Petty Officer <PERSON> Veronica </PERSON> <PERSON> Cady </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. Military pilots and rescuers trained to parachute into the ocean to save ditched pilots could only watch helplessly as their aircraft tracked the single-engine plane for nearly four hours while it slowly ran out of gas. The plane crashed in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. `` With all that time he did n't answer us, no communciation whatsoever, seen slumped behind the wheel, we assumed he was at the least unconscious,'' Ms. <PERSON> Cady </PERSON> said. `` For him to survive a crash like that, it just sent us all into shock. We did n't expect this story to have a happy ending.'' Rescuers did n't know how he got out of the plane, she said. There was no immediate word on the man's condition. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> declined to identify the pilot, but staff members at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> law firm of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Root </PERSON>, 36, a communications lawyer, confirmed that he was the man. Nothing more was heard from him after he reported to air traffic controllers in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> at 8:30 a.m. that he was having chest pains and difficulty breathing. He had taken off from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> at about 6:30 a.m., bound for Rocky Mount, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION> The man was glimpsed, apparently unconscious, at one point as the plane headed southward roughly parallel to the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. There was no one else visible in the plane, and radio messages to the plane went unanswered. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said the plane ran out of gas and crashed into the ocean in the central <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, about 15 miles east of the island of <LOCATION> Eleuthera </LOCATION>. The site is about 250 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and 800 miles from the pilot's original destination. Reports from the planes tailing the <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> were that `` it spiraled into the water, so it did n't make the best of all possible landings,'' Chief Petty Officer <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Parris </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> said that as the plane headed southward it had gotten as near as 100 miles from the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> shore because of the curvature of the coastline. <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, manager of the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mount-Wilson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, airport, said the plane had been due to arrive there at 7:49 a.m. <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> said a person had been waiting to meet the pilot and the plane. He did not know if that person was a relative and did not identify the person. After its distress call, the plane was intercepted by two <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F-A-18 </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hornets </ORGANIZATION> when it entered <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> Naval Station airspace at 8:45 a.m., said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The pilots of the intercepting planes tried unsuccessfully to establish voice contact with the pilot, he said. The Cessna 210 Centurion can seat four to six people, counting the pilot, and cruises at about 190 mph. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierman </PERSON>, shift supervisor in the air traffic control tower at <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> Raleigh </ORGANIZATION> radio station <ORGANIZATION> WPTF </ORGANIZATION> the plane `` very easily'' could wind up in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. `` Put an airplane on automatic pilot and it's going to continue just exactly on the course that the automatic pilot is set for.'' He said the automatic pilot was set on a heading that would have sent the plane toward <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, but the pilot would have made a turn for the Rocky Mount-Wilson Airport. The two rescue teams are part of the <ORGANIZATION> 301st </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recovery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squad </ORGANIZATION>. The C-130 part of the squad is based at Homestead, the helicopter part at <LOCATION> Patrick </LOCATION>, said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanek </PERSON> of Homestead Air Force Base. A flight surgeon was part of the rescue teams as well as the people trained to parachute in the water, she said. Root's staff gathered around a portable radio to hear news that he had been fished out of the water alive, but <PERSON> Signe </PERSON> <PERSON> Schilperoort </PERSON>, a paralegal in the office, said they had received no word on the rescue or on Root's condition from authorities. She said Root had no history of medical problems and had been flying since he was a teen-ager.

<TEXT>
 A national group of engineers, urged by a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> official to take a stand, called Thursday for actions to combat overheating of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> without waiting for absolute proof it is happening. The steps should include efforts to improve the cleanliness of coal burning, to increase use of nuclear energy and to plant more trees, according to the report released by <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daman </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mechanical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>. While there are still scientific uncertainties about the `` greenhouse effect,'' there is enough evidence to show that the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is increasing, said <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Moghissi </PERSON>, who headed the society's risk analysis task force. `` A prudent course of action may consist of assuming that adverse effects may take place and that corrective actions may be necessary,'' said <PERSON> Moghissi </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland-Baltimore </ORGANIZATION>. The society released a position paper entitled `` Energy and the Environment,'' including a wide-ranging series of recommendations for improving energy efficiency as a means of helping the environment. <PERSON> Daman </PERSON> said the decision to issue a position paper on global change, a controversial issue in recent years, had generated debate within the 116,000-member society of mechanical engineers. However, he said White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, an engineer and a member of the society, helped spur the group to action. <PERSON> Daman </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> had told him that if technical groups want to be listened to they have to stop issuing `` general, do-good-things'' reports and instead take positions on issues. `` We have to do that, I think <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> is right,'' <PERSON> Daman </PERSON> said. Some environmental groups have criticized the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration for taking what they consider a too-cautious approach to the issue of global warming. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> officials have said the issue is hardly clear-cut, but a report last month by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> advisory <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> said the government might find it necessary to plan `` future projects considering climate change even before all the uncertainties are known.'' The engineering society's report deals with the theory that increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could cause the climate to warm, melting polar ice caps, disrupting farming and leading to other major changes in society. Carbon dioxide allows shortwave radiation from the sun to pass through to the earth but blocks the long-wave radiation from earth that ordinarily travels out into space. Many scientists believe that this change will result in an increase in the average temperature of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, although others say too little is known to reach any conclusions yet. The mechanical engineers conclude in their study that research should be accelerated on the greenhouse effect, including an international agreement on reforestation. The group called for an international fund to help maintain tropical rain forests, plus a national effort toward planting more trees across this country. Trees and other plants remove carbon dioxide from the air. Other proposals put forth by the engineers include: _ Incentives for improving the efficiency of coal-burning plants _ Substantial research to develop safer nuclear reactors, based on currently operating reactors _ Development of technology to improve the fuel efficiency of automobiles _ Continued support for the development of renewable energy systems _ Establishment of a central facility for receiving, evaluating and packing spent nuclear fuel and preparing it for final disposal _ A national effort to reprocess and recycle nuclear fuel _ Improvement of material requirements and safety of hydrogen energy _ Increased research on acid rain reduction

<HEAD>Group Says Secret Grant Approval System Unfair</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A public group charged Thursday that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> uses a secret system `` ripe for abuse'' to evaluate grant applications from scientists, and urged the agency to make the process more open. Public Citizen, a non-profit advocacy organization, told <ORGANIZATION> NSF </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> that the system violates `` the letter and the spirit of various federal laws that are designed to make federal agency decision-making fair and accountable.'' <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Glitzenstein </PERSON>, a lawyer for Public Citizen, said at a news conference that the <ORGANIZATION> NSF </ORGANIZATION> for 14 years maintained a system of record keeping that blocked grant applicants from learning what had been put into their permanent file. That meant unfounded allegations about a scientist were kept secret, even if the information played a role in denying his grant application, <PERSON> Glitzenstein </PERSON> said. `` The scientist can not learn about the allegation, can not respond to it, and has virtually no ability to appeal the denial,'' he said. `` Anytime you have system based on secret reviews, you have a potential for abuse.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NSF </ORGANIZATION> is distributing about $ 1.8 billion to about 16,000 research projects for the 1989 fiscal year, officials said. The petition sent to <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> also alleges that the <ORGANIZATION> NSF </ORGANIZATION> has an inadquate system for dealing with potential conflicts of interest that may affect approval of an applicants grant. Applicants, <PERSON> Glitzenstein </PERSON> said, are n't allowed to know who is reviewing their proposal, which means reviewers could include scientists who compete with the applicant. That system also is `` ripe for abuse,'' <PERSON> Glitzenstein </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee drafting a Puerto Rican plebiscite bill criticized the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration Thursday for failing to answer questions concerning the economic impact of proposed statehood or `` enhanced'' commonwealth status. Those alternatives to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>'s commonwealth status will be on the ballot when the people of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> vote in a referendum scheduled for 1991, and Sen. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, D-La., thinks the voters should know in advance what their choice will entail <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, irritated by the absence from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s aide handling Puerto Rican affairs, told a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> official that his request to leave the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hearing early was an `` insult to this committee and to the Puerto Rican status issue.'' <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gideon </PERSON>, assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> for tax policy, responded that the administration is willing to work with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee on the plebiscite. He told the committee, `` The choice facing the people of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> is fundamentally a political one, with long-term implications for their rights and obligations as citizens.'' But this view clashed with that of <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who believes Puerto Rican voters should know in advance what they should expect in terms of future <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> funds for food, health and other basic programs under any transition afforded under independence or statehood. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> is asking the administration to spell out in detail the fiscal impact of major federally funded programs and is seeking information regarding all 385 federally funded programs on the island. <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> presently participates in all but 30 U.S.-funded programs under its present commonwealth status. In seeking `` enhanced'' commonwealth status, Gov. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON> seeks a larger voice for the island in determining which federal laws should be applicable to the island. The governor first proposed the holding of a status plebiscite during an inaugural address earlier this year. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, who earlier scored President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for remarking on his personal preference on the island, said he hopes for an evenhanded approach to all options during the referendum. He said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration needs `` a totally new attitude'' regarding the plebiscite and the present hearings on legislation setting up the federally supported referendum.

<TEXT>
 King Fahd of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> called for Islamic unity Thursday as 1.8 million Moslems ended the annual pilgrimage to their holiest shrines guarded by anti-terrorism squads deployed after two bombings. Fahd made no mention of the explosions Monday that killed a Pakistani pilgrim and wounded 16 other people near the Grand Mosque in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, the birthplace of the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>. `` Our prayer is ... that the coming feasts will see the sons of the Islamic nation in solidarity, united and cooperating for the good of our causes and efforts to strengthen security, spread peace, establish justice, and restore rights,'' he said in a message broadcast by Saudi radio and television. As twilight descended around <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, the army of pilgrims prayed before they slit the throats of more than 1 million sheep, cows and camels for Eid al-Adha, or the Feast of Sacrifice. The meat traditionally went to poor Saudis. But since the discovery of oil virtually eliminated poverty in the kingdom, most is flown to poor Moslems in 26 countries. The faithful then streamed down <PERSON> Mount </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to the scorching Plain of <PERSON> Mina </PERSON> and went on to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> for final prayers during the pilgrimage, or hajj. Waves of veiled women and men in white seamless robes, signifying equality before <PERSON> Allah </PERSON>, took part in the prayers televised live by satellite to scores of Islamic countries. Monday's bombings were the only incidents to mar this year's pilgrimage, and came amid an intensifying war of words with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> over the Saudis limit of 1,000 pilgrims for every 1 million population in Moslem countries <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> boycotted the pilgrimage, as it did when the limits were introduced last year and cut its usual contingent of 150,000 by two-thirds. Saudi security authorities have detained an undisclosed number of suspects in the bombings. The Saudis have not accused any group or country, although <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> newspapers pointed to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Iranian leaders denied involvement and accused Saudi authorities of trying to discredit them. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> has used the bombings to strengthen its calls for the overthrow of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s royal family, which it accuses of being anti-Islamic, underscoring the historic rift between the world's 1 billion Moslems. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s estimated 50 million people are overwhelmingly of the Shiite sect. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s 12 million people, like most Moslems, mainly are from the mainstream Sunni sect. The Saudis cited vast renovation and construction projects in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> and other holy sites for reducing the number of pilgrims. They severed relations with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in April last year, citing terrorism and subversion. Relations between the two countries, soured by Saudi support of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the Iran-Iraq war, worsened during the 1987 hajj when the Saudis charged Iranian pilgrims started riots that killed more than 400 pilgrims, mostly Iranians. The Saudis have spent billions of dollars modernizing the holy cities and providing all manner of services for what has become a logistical nightmare. Pilgrims once trudged in the sweltering heat on foot or by camel to make the hajj. Now, they are transported free in 7,500 air-conditioned buses, hundreds of trucks and scores of helicopters. The hajj, which must be made at least once by all Moslems who can afford it, is the world's largest religious congress. It brings together Arabian princes, merchants from <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, paupers from <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Each year, Moslems from <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> and other states join in chanting `` God is so great and to him we pay high tribute.'' At <LOCATION> Mina </LOCATION>, each pilgrim throws seven stones at each of the three `` devil pillars,'' a spot where Moslems believe the devil tried to tempt <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> to disobey <PERSON> Allah </PERSON> and refuse to sacrifice his son. It was 120 degrees Thursday when swarms of hajjis rushed to a Mina gorge to `` stone the devil.'' Many were hospitalized for sunstroke. During the hajj, pilgrims must abstain from sex and may not quarrel, cut their hair, or even kill a fly.

<HEAD>Leaders at Summit Bring Different Agendas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The leaders of the world's seven largest industrial democracies are in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> for the 15th annual economic summit. Here are sketches of the leaders and their priorities for the summit. <ORGANIZATION> UNITED </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> STATES </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 65, is attending his first economic summit. He arrives with proposals on global pollution, a new strategy for resolving the Third World debt problem and recommendations to foster economic and democratic reforms in communist <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The administration is hoping that these initiatives will allow <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to assume the leadership role in the Western alliance on economic and environmental matters in much the same way he established his leadership on military policy at the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit in May. On the environment, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will also be seeking international cooperation in combating depletion of the ozone layer, global warming, deforestation and ocean dumping. On debt, the administration will be pushing the plan unveiled March 10 by <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, which stresses voluntary forgiveness by commercial banks of a portion of the $ 1.2 trillion in Third World debt. In return, the banks would receive guarantees underwritten by international lending agencies that the remaining debt would be repaid. While economic growth in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is slowing, most economists believe the country will be able to avoid a recession this year. However, there is concern about an uptick in inflation this year and worries as well that improvement in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s huge trade deficit may have stalled out. Given <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s extensive international experience, he at least wo n't have the handicap that former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> faced at his first economic summit. In 1981, the other world leaders viewed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as something of an oddity, an actor-turned-president with strange ideas about supply-side economics. <LOCATION> BRITAIN </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, 63, is the most senior of the summiteers, having celebrated her 10th year in office in May. But she goes to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> with her <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government in trouble. In June 15 elections for the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, the Conservatives were routed by the opposition socialist <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. It was Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s first defeat in a national election since she won office. And for the first time since she won a third consecutive five-year term in the 1987 general election, <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s personal approval ratings are behind those of Labor leader <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> -LRB- 34 percent versus 41 percent for <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> -RRB-. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> expects major debate on the resurgence of inflation. British inflation has risen from an annual rate of 4.2 percent a year ago to 8.3 percent, double the average for other European nations. The high inflation, accompanied by steep increases in interest rates, has led to consumer unrest and rising union militancy. There have been simultaneous one-day strikes by railroad and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> subway workers, mainly over pay. <LOCATION> FRANCE </LOCATION> Socialist President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, 72, ranks No. 2 in seniority behind <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, having just been re-elected to a second seven-year term last spring. He is still riding comfortably high in the opinion polls as his conservative opposition flounders in divisive squabbles. His biggest economic headache is the same one he has had since first elected in May 1981 _ unemployment, which has been at or above 10 percent for several years. The French trade deficit has also been rising in recent months. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s top priority is debt. He has long cast himself as champion of the downtrodden, debt-ridden Third World. In May, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> unilaterally forgave 16 billion francs -LRB- $ 2.5 billion -RRB- in public sector debt to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 35 poorest countries. The French are looking for other summit countries to match that generosity. On the issue of the debt burden being carried by larger Third World nations such as <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the French want to come up with a package amalgamating the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan with ideas put forward by the Japanese and by <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> last September. All those plans generally call for forgving a portion of the big debtor countries' debts in exchange for guarantees that the rest will be paid. JAPAN

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, 66, is the newest leader at the summit and the most besieged. He comes to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> at a time when his government is shaken by an influence-peddling scandal and by allegations that he kept a number of paid mistresses. Uno, then foreign minister, succeeded former Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> a little over a month ago when <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> resigned in the wake of the bribery scandal. Now Uno is rumored to be near resignation because of the sex scandal and his political party is at its lowest point in 34 years of rule. In an effort to shore up his image as an international leader, Uno will pledge nearly $ 40 billion in new funds for debt relief and environmental assistance to developing nations, an impressive package which should deflect criticism that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, now the world's largest creditor country, has not done enough to relieve the crushing debt burden faced by the Third World But it remains to be seen whether the new assistance package and other Japanese initiatives would be enough to defuse <PERSON> Ono </PERSON>'s worsening political position back home. WEST <LOCATION> GERMANY </LOCATION> Despite a vibrant economy, Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, 59, head of government since October 1982, is another summit leader facing major problems at home. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s ratings in opinion polls have slid dramatically in the past six months and some observers say he may not win federal elections slated for December 1990. In an effort to bolster his image, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> announced a major Cabinet shakeup in April. At the summit, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is expected to caution against doing anything that would unleash inflation. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which is expected to post a growth rate of 3.5 percent this year, recently boosted a key interest rate in an effort to guard against inflation. The move, however, displeased the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, which believes the interest rate increase will slow German consumer demand and dampen the country's appetite for imported goods including <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products. It is expected that both <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will press their respective sides of this dispute during the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> summit. <LOCATION> ITALY </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> is going though one of its recurring government crises. The coalition led by <ORGANIZATION> Premier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ciriaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mita </ORGANIZATION>, a Christian Democrat, resigned May 19 and negotiations to form a new government are still under way. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON>, 61, will represent <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> at the summit in his capacity as caretaker premier. This has not been an impediment in the past. A caretaker Italian government hosted the economic summit in <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> in 1987. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> has headed up the government since April 1988. Italian officials are focusing on three issues at the summit _ cleaning up the environment, fighting the drug epidemic and Third World debt. On the environment, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> would like to see standards established to measure performance by each country. According to one forecast, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s economy is expected to grow at a healthy annual rate of 3.5 percent this year and slow only marginally in 1990. But the upbeat forecast on growth is clouded by concern over inflation, which has been creeping up to an annual rate of 7 percent. <LOCATION> CANADA </LOCATION> Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, 50, will be looking in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> for confirmation that inflation poses a threat on the international front. His government has insisted that interest rates remain high to avert the threat of inflation, despite complaints that they could speed the start of a slowdown or even, in the worst forecasts, recession. The Canadian inflation rate of 5 percent so far this year is the highest in five years. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> is in the first year of his second term and has embarked on a program intended to eventually bring the government's budget deficit under control. But other than his austerity message, critics say his government is adrift in the second term without any major theme after the big drive to win approval in 1988 for a free trade agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The environment has emerged as a hot topic in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, so <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> is interested in pushing the environmental agenda at the summit in hopes that he can portray himself as a world leader on the issue back home.

 Rooftop marksmen, airborne television cameras and a security force of 30,000 protected the leaders of 34 nations Thursday as they kicked off the bicentennial celebration of the French Revolution. Extra radar installations and even ground-to-air missiles were in place for the three-day celebration and for the summit of the world's seven leading industrialized democracies, which begins Friday. `` It's going well, very well,'' said <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanot </PERSON>, chief of police at the summit site in western <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. `` Anyhow, you ca n't be a pessimist in this business.'' The guns and guards were focused first on <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>' main boulevards, where red, white and blue flags flew and noisy motorcades carried leaders to an array of bicentennial events _ not always to the pleasure of pedestrians. On the Rue du <LOCATION> Faubourg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Honore </LOCATION>, the elegant street on which the Elysee Palace of President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> is situated, police shoved Parisians back into their shops as motorcades sped by. `` I thought this was our city,'' one resident grumbled. Parts of the city were closed to drivers through the weekend. Although many residents fled the city to avoid the mess, police said 1,000 cars were towed Thursday alone. Popular low-lying `` fly boats'' for tourists were forbidden from plying the <LOCATION> Seine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> running through <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. A 200-foot-long blimp, which can carry a crew of 10, relayed live television pictures from two cameras to ground command centers. The dirigible, estimated to cost $ 7 million, was used earlier this month for surveillance during the visit of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Mirage fighters and Crotale ground-to-air missiles backed up the blimp, and six radar systems were added to the four normally installed around <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to ensure that uninvited guests did not enter the skies, security officials said. At the <ORGANIZATION> Arch </ORGANIZATION>, the gleaming arch-shaped building where the seven summiteers will meet, police also planned air protection, said <PERSON> Hanot </PERSON>. He said that in addition to 4,000 police in and around the steel fence ringing the site, 200 sharpshooters were to be stationed on the rooftops of the jumble of skyscrapers in the area. During the summit, traffic will be halted along the five-mile route from central <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to the Arch for an hour each in the morning and the afternoon to allow the foreign leaders to travel, said police.

 Fellow villagers expected something terrible of <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dornier </ORGANIZATION>, but the madness of the strange, brooding man was worse than they had feared. Dornier shot and killed 14 people _ including his mother and sister, and wounded eight others, including his father, in a two-hour rampage on Wednesday. `` It was a bloodbath,'' <PERSON> Dominique </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuenot </PERSON> of the village council said Thursday. `` We knew he would create havoc one day and the police should have dealt with him months ago. Unfortunately, our laws do n't allow such preventive action.'' `` Everyone here was afraid of <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dornier </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Clausse </PERSON>, whose father, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON>, is mayor. `` His behavior was strange. No one ever complained to the police about him, but we all knew.'' This farming village in eastern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> had 128 residents when <PERSON> Dornier </PERSON>, 31, picked up his shotgun Wednesday. When his murderous spree was over, seven of them were dead, including three children. He killed seven more from nearby villages and seriously wounded eight people. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Clausse </PERSON> saw Dornier driving up in his car Wednesday, pointing his double-barreled shotgun through the window. `` From my upstairs window, I saw he was pointing his gun directly at my mother, so I aimed my own gun at him and fired,'' <PERSON> Claussee </PERSON> said. `` I saw the blood spurting from a wound in his neck, but then he fled and I saw nothing more of him.'' <PERSON> Joel </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Ginettte </PERSON>, said she owes her life to her son. Her 5-year-old niece, <PERSON> Pauline </PERSON>, was killed while playing in the garden. <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornier </PERSON>'s killings began with his sister, <PERSON> Corinne </PERSON>, 26, who was married only last Saturday. `` There was no argument or quarrel of any kind,'' said <PERSON> Dornier </PERSON>'s younger brother, <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> `` He picked up his gun and fired it point-blank at <PERSON> Corinne </PERSON>, killing her instantly. Then in the mad scene that followed, my mother, <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON>, telephoned to the police for help. He fired and killed her, too.'' Dornier's father, <PERSON> Georges </PERSON>, 63, was one of the eight people hospitalized with serious wounds. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Maillard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Corinne </PERSON>'s husband, escaped only because he was in the toilet, <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> said. Then <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornier </PERSON> got in his car, a black <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION>, and set off on his shooting spree. He was seriously wounded when police caught up with him and opened fire, and was being treated in a <LOCATION> Besancon </LOCATION> hospital Thursday under police guard. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, an anti-hunting group called for tighter controls on firearms used by hunters, which are much easier to obtain than tightly regulated handguns and other weapons. The Rally of Opponents to Hunting issued a statement saying hunting weapons should be taken away from `` from people under therapeutic medicine,'' and even hunters out of season. <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornier </PERSON> works for the <ORGANIZATION> Peugeot </ORGANIZATION> automobile manufacturing plant at <LOCATION> Montbeliard </LOCATION> and, like many young Frenchmen, has little interest in farming. He said the family had agreed Christian should ultimately take over the farm from his parents, and it would be sold if if he could not work it on his own. <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> estimated the 148 acres were worth about $ 60,000. `` Christian was a taciturn, depressed fellow,'' <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> said of his brother. `` He had no friends, hardly ever talked to anyone. A few weeks ago he suddenly got a punk haircut. He did strange things like that and we did not pay much attention.'' People in the village began to talk, including neighbor <PERSON> Remy </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrand </PERSON>, who said <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> shot at him last month, and a farmer's wife who said he pelted her with stones early one morning a few weeks ago The village council discussed what to do and decided no action was called for because <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dornier </ORGANIZATION> had never been in trouble with the law. `` We advised the family to get him psychiatric treatment, and they did,'' said <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleury </PERSON>, a council member. A psychiatrist came regularly from nearby Baume-les-Dames and prescribed tranquilizers, but <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> said his brother did not take them. `` We thought something happened to him during his 12 months' military service about eight years ago,'' <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> said `` He was never the same after that.'' Three children playing in their gardens or bicycling were among those killed from <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dornier </ORGANIZATION>'s car. So were several elderly people in nearby villages, a farmer driving his tractor in a field, the schoolteacher at neighboring <LOCATION> Autechaux </LOCATION> and the wife of the mayor of nearby Voilans. The teacher and mayor's wife arrived at a crossroads, in separate cars, simultaneously with Dornier. Both were shot to death and their cars crashed. Capt. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarrazin </PERSON>, police commander at Baume-les Dames, was struck by bullets in his neck and groin while driving to <ORGANIZATION> Luxiol </ORGANIZATION> in response to Mrs. <PERSON> Dornier </PERSON>'s call. He was undergoing emergency treatment Thursday. The bodies of the victims were laid out in the various town halls and were to be buried simultaneously Friday. All celebrations of Friday's 200th anniversary of the French revolution were canceled in the region.

 The leaders of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> on Thursday urged <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> to help organize a summit meeting as soon as possible between developed and developing nations. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> endorsed the proposal but said he would not seek a decision on the issue at a summit meeting of the leaders of seven major industrialized nations that starts here Friday. In a communique issued on the eve of the annual economic summit, Presidents <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Abdou </PERSON> <PERSON> Diouf </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> joined with Indian Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> in saying: `` We believe that steps must be taken to organize a summit-level meeting as soon as possible with a view to discussing global economic and environmental questions of mutual interest.'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> told the four that he was `` ready to take the steps necessary to bring about the project,'' said presidential spokesman <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vedrine </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Vedrine </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> did not intend to ask the other nations participating in the economic summit _ <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> _ to decide on the request for a major conference among the developed and undeveloped nations. `` This is not something for the immediate future,'' <PERSON> Vedrine </PERSON> told a press conference. The four leaders, representing nations in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, said the proposed conference should mark the beginning of a consultative process between leaders from the developed and developing world. The call for a summit among the leaders of the developed and undeveloped nations was the first publicized result of some 20 bilateral meetings as well as informal lunchtime conversations among the leaders of 34 nations gathered here for the summit and the bicentennial celebration of the French Revolution. During their 15th annual economic summit this weekend, the participants are expected to address the problem of the $ 1.2 trillion debt that has stunted the developing world's growth for more than a decade. Both <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> are expected to push for partial forgiveness of Third World debts in exchange for guarantees of repayment of the balance. Officials said <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> discussed the issue with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at a luncheon at the Elysee Palace for almost three dozen heads of state and government attending the French Revolution bicentennial events. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, who sat next to <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, raised the issue with the British leader. The developing nations' leaders made their pitch for the ear of the richer nations at a time when the industrialized countries are steeped in a sense of economic optimism, with the economic woes that dominated previous summits apparently under control. Summit host <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, to whom the communique was addressed, has cast himself as a champion of poorer nations and announced in May that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> would forgive debts totalling $ 2.5 billion owed by 35 African nations. In his response to the four leaders, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> expressed `` his appreciation of this idea, which is in line with his ongoing action in view of restarting the ... dialogue'' between the world's rich and poor nations, his spokesman said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, too, announced earlier this month it would forgive the debt of the poorest nations of sub-Saharan <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Bank May Seek Cut of Jackpot for Ex-Employee's Crime</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A bank says it's considering going after a cut of the $ 6 million lottery jackpot won by the husband of a former employee who cheated the bank. `` Our attorneys are examining possible options,'' said <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're exploring, in light of her recent good fortune, our options to recover some of our losses that she caused. The jackpot was won this week by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, whose wife, <PERSON> Darlene </PERSON>, a former bond trader for the bank, pleaded guilty in December to federal charges of making false entries in bank ledgers to make it appear the bank was profiting from her bond trades when it in fact was losing money. Mrs. <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> was placed on five years' probation and ordered to pay $ 12,000 restitution. The purported profits brought her $ 66,000 in commissions before she was fired from her job, which carried a $ 60,000 annual salary. First Interstate says the scheme cost it $ 3.5 million in 1987. It is n't clear if the bank can tap <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>'s winnings for his wife's actions because state lottery rules require the money be paid directly to the winner, said <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON>, a lottery spokeswoman. The couple has declared bankruptcy. Mrs. <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, said he would oppose any move to go after the winnings. `` At the time of the sentencing, that's all the money she had,'' he said. `` They ca n't take it away from her now just because she has more.'' It's the second time a Lotto jackpot has proved a bittersweet victory since the game was launched six months ago. In April, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Tecci </PERSON>, a public relations and political consultant, and his girlfriend won a $ 7 million jackpot. Within days, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> tapped him for $ 24,700 for eight years of child support.

<HEAD>Worker Interviewed by U.S. TV Crew Sentenced to Prison</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> sentenced an office worker to 10 years in prison Thursday for telling an American television crew that the military massacred thousands of people in its attack on demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. An intermediate court in the <LOCATION> northeast </LOCATION> port city of <LOCATION> Dalian </LOCATION> found <PERSON> Xiao </PERSON> <PERSON> Bin </PERSON>, 42, guilty of `` spreading counterrevolutionary rumors.'' It deprived him of all political rights for three years. The national evening television news showed <PERSON> Xiao </PERSON>, a junior section chief in a rubber factory, being led by police into the court to receive the verdict. <PERSON> Xiao </PERSON>, in an interview with an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> television crew, said 20,000 people were killed in the military assault to re-capture <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> from students demonstrating for democratic reforms. In an emotional statement, he told <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> that military tanks had run over people and troops had shot to death people wounded by beatings or gunfire. <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> apparently intercepted the unedited video as <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> sent it by satellite to its <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> headquarters. The state-run television subsequently broadcast the interview and urged viewers to help find the man. Two women reported him within hours and he was arrested June 11. The women were commended and given cash rewards. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said it was `` deeply distressed'' over the use of its tape and began covering the faces of students it interviewed. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> denies anyone was killed on Tiananmen Square. It says about 200 civilians were killed as troops battled rioters who threw stones and firebombs to stop them from reaching the square. Chinese sources and Western diplomats have said up to 3,000 may have died when troops opened fire on unarmed protesters. Earlier Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> denied <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has become a diplomatic outcast because of the bloody events at <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said most nations support <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s tough measures to eliminate political dissent. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Jinhua </PERSON>, asked at a weekly briefing how <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> reacts to the outpouring of international criticism, said: `` Your assessment is different from mine. `` The fact is that there are only a few countries who are interfering in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s internal affairs. The majority of countries have expressed their understanding, sympathy and even support for us.'' She repeated <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s protests to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> for harboring wanted dissidents Wu'er <PERSON> Kaixi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiaqi </PERSON> and said <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> was guilty of `` flagrant violation of international law and the norms governing international relations.'' Most strong criticism has come from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, although some communist countries such as <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> also have deplored the loss of life in the <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> attack. The only countries to support <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s crackdown have been hard-line communist states such as <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Most Third World countries have said only that they have no wish to interfere in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s internal affairs. On Wednesday, Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> and new <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON> told a gathering of ambassadors and diplomats they must `` increase their work in explaining the truth to counter rumors of Western reports.'' <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> said the diplomats must `` help foreign friends get rid of their misunderstandings'' of recent events in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Chinese authorities also tried to present their version of events Thursday at a seminar with foreign tour agents in which they handed out copies of a government report that condemned the student-led protests as counterrevolutionary and carried pictures of soldiers' burnt and beaten bodies The travel agents, invited to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> seeks ways to salvage its nearly defunct tourist industry, agreed that <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> must either lift martial law or reduce the military presence before it can expect foreign tourists to return. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> earned $ 2 billion in hard currency from tourism last year. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> also has lost several major international conventions, including a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> that was scheduled for September. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s representative <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ming </PERSON> expressed `` great regret'' Thursday over the association's July 5 decision to change the site of the 23-nation conference to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has been preparing for the annual meeting for a year and that social order in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> has returned to normal and will be further stabilized, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` We will unswervingly carry out the policy of reform and opening and our trade and economic relations with other countries and regions will further develop. All foresighted economists and entrepreneurs can see this,'' <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it will add 52 military installations, nuclear fuel facilities and nuclear laboratories to its list of the nation's worst hazardous waste sites It gave no sign how much the required cleanups will cost. `` Many of these facilities are much larger and more complex than other Superfund sites, with wide varieties of of hazardous and radioactive wastes,'' <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said in a news release announcing the additions. Because they are federal facilities owned by various agencies, mostly the Defense and Energy departments, the cleanups mandated by Superfund legislation will come out of the agency budgets, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said. `` You will see -LRB- budget -RRB- demands ballooning in future years as remedies are selected and the cleanup process, the expensive part of the process, kicks in,'' <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON>, the assistant <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator in charge of the Superfund said. The list includes such facilities as the Feed Materials Production Center in <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the Oak Ridge Reservation in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Brookhaven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> nuclear military plant in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livermore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Picatinny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arsenal </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, a 100-year-old munitions testing and storage depot, is also listed. Most of the sites slated for addition to the National Priorities, or Superfund, list are military installation. The 52 sites announced Thursday are in 26 states. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> had the most sites _ 10 _ followed by <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, each with four. Of the 52 sites, 41 belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, nine to <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION>, one to the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and one to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. All the DOE sites contain both hazardous and radioactive waste, except the <ORGANIZATION> Bonneville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Complex </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>. Those eight DOE sites are <ORGANIZATION> Brookhaven </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Upton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Livermore </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Livermore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; the Fernald center; the Mound Plant in <LOCATION> Miamisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>; Monticello Mill Tailings in <LOCATION> Monticello </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>; and the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> So far the priorities list has 1,224 hazarous waste sites, 889 of which are final and 335 are proposed. Federal sites account for 115 of that total, with 41 final and 74 proposed. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> says the list will evenually include more than 200 federal facilities. Once a site is proposed for inclusion, that proposal is open for public comment, usually about 60 days. The list then becomes final. According to <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials at a news briefing, the first step once a site makes the list is a period of study and negotiations lasting up to two years to determine a cleanup course. Federal law requires that actual cleanup work begins no more than 15 months later. States and concerned citizens of the states, as well as the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, may intervene to make sure the cleanup proceeds as scheduled. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials noted that the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had $ 500 million in cleanup money in its budget proposal for fiscal 1990, but they refused to comment on whether the funds would be adequate. `` We have not engaged in budgeteering relating to these cleanups,'' said Cannon. <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> did say there were <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> estimates that the cleanup of DOE facilities would cost between $ 80 billion and $ 115 billion. The problem with time and cost estimates, he said, is `` we do n't know what the ultimate remedies are going to be. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> says that to speed up the negotiations over the individual site cleanups it is asking to increase the number of its specialized Superfund fieldworkers from 34 to 116.

 One hundred and ninety-nine years ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Marquis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fayette </ORGANIZATION> gave the key to the Bastille to President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>. On Thursday, the Americans gave it back. Well, for a week anyway. The Bastille was the central <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> prison stormed by the populace on July 14, 1789. That action became the symbol of the French Revolution. The Bastille later was destroyed. But the marquis, who served as a general under <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> during the American Revolution, made a gift of the key as `` a tribute, which I owe as a son to my adopted father, as an aide de camp to my general, as a missionary of liberty to its patriarch.'' The key has hung in the central corridor of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> home, <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vernon </ORGANIZATION>, since the end of his presidency. The key was presented to President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> on nine-day loan by <PERSON> Eugenia </PERSON> <PERSON> Seamans </PERSON>, regent of the <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vernon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ladies </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit organization that has owned and operated <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vernon </ORGANIZATION> since 1858 The large iron key will be displayed through July 22 at the new <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Place </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> la </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bastille </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, next to where the prison once stood, as part of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s bicentennial celebrations. The very brief ceremony was held at the <ORGANIZATION> Elysee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> immediately after the 40-minute meeting between <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, here for the bicentennial festivities and to attend the summit of the seven major industrial democracies. As <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> looked on, Mrs. <PERSON> Seaman </PERSON> told the French president it had hung in the central hall of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vernon </LOCATION> since 1797. `` Now it's again in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>,'' she said, handing transparent box containing the key to a beaming <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>. As photographers and cameraman recorded the event, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> shook hands with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and said: `` I thank the successors of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' The loan of the key was arranged through the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. By Aug. 1, the famous key is expected to be hanging back in the hallway of the <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vernon </LOCATION> mansion.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday approved new rules that will allow thousands of FM stations serving small communities to double their signal strengths and reach larger audiences. The commission, in a 3-0 vote, said so-called Class A FM stations could boost their power from the present limit of 3,000 watts up to 6,000 watts. The commission said the increased power will allow these stations to provide better service to their listeners without causing interference problems with other stations. The commission also revised the distances by which Class A stations must be separated from other stations in order to limit interference. The current separation is about 65 miles -LRB- 105 kilometers -RRB-, while the new separation will be about 71 miles -LRB- 115 kilometers -RRB-, effective Oct. 2. `` The area covered will be 40 percent greater,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, an official in the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s mass media bureau. Existing stations that do not meet the revised separation requirements will be `` grandfathered,'' and will be allowed to relocate their antennas or request permission to use directional antennas, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. There are more than 2,000 Class A FM stations nationwide, the most numerous of the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s seven classes of FM stations and those which have the smallest service areas. The largest FM stations have signals with 100,000 watts or more. The commission said the small communities to which Class A channels were originally allotted have grown over the years, while the coverage of these stations has remained unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> expressed concern about the commission being hit with a wave of applications from stations that need permission to boost their signal strength. He said the current backlog was six months in processing such applications and that it could increase to 18 months under the crush of new filings. He said he hoped <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will allocate additional funds to the agency to handle the expected glut. `` But we should not forgo good policy decisions because it will strain bureau resources,'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> added. He acknowledged that some FM stations had asked that the rules be applied in a `` blanket'' fashion, rather than on a selective basis. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said a blanket approach would have caused too many interference problems. `` We have not granted all the latitude that was requested,'' he said. To allow many stations to increase their power without delay, the commission said it will publish a list of existing Class A stations that will be able to boost their signal without interfering with other stations. It estimated that about 500 stations will be on the list. Licensees who can increase their power with simple technical changes will be allowed to do so on or after Dec. 1, the commission said, provided that the changes will not subject workers or residents to hazardous levels of radio frequency energy radiation.

 Anti-apartheid groups, unsure how to react to talks between President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and black leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, reversed course Thursday and said the meeting was a positive development. `` We do not condemn the meeting at all,'' <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON>, was quoted as saying Thursday by the independent <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` For us to get to the negotiation table, we have to start somewhere.'' Neither <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> nor his heir apparent, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, has commented on the July 5 meeting at the presidential residence in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. Anti-apartheid groups, including <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, initially dismissed the talks as government propaganda that involved no shift in policy. But in a statement Wednesday, <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> appeared to welcome his chance to talk with <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>. `` I only would like to contribute to the creation of the climate which would promote peace in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' the jailed, 70-year-old activist said. `` I would also like to confirm that my release is not an issue at this stage.'' The statement was <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s first since 1985 that was approved by the government for public release. Member of Parliament <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzman </PERSON>, a longtime apartheid foe, had lunch with <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> on Thursday but would not disclose anything he said except, `` He told me he was pleased to have met ... President <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>.'' She had not seen him since August, when he was being treated in hospital for tuberculosis. She said he described his health as good and he was in very good spirits. `` He keeps fit with the help of an exercise bicycle and he is visited regularly by his doctor,'' she said. Anti-apartheid leader <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> appeared with Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> on Sunday and said the meeting was `` political mischief'' intended to `` sow confusion in the minds of black people.'' The South African Council of Churches, which <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> leads, said Wednesday it was a `` calculated attempt by the government to make maximum political gain.'' However, <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> said Thursday: `` I welcome Mr. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s commitment to contribute in any way possible to the creation of a climate which will promote peace in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s statement was `` remarkably statesmanlike'' and should dispel the belief among many South African whites that <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> is a `` so-called terrorist.'' `` White <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is going to be quite, quite amazed when they get to hear him speak for himself,'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said. The outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> dismissed the meeting Monday as a `` public relations exercise.'' It has not commented publicly on <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s statement. `` Mandela Wants Peace,'' said the front-page headline in <LOCATION> Die </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Burger </LOCATION>, a pro-government Afrikaans-language newspaper. `` Mandela: Peace By Dialogue,'' said The Citizen, a pro-government English-language daily. Such headlines were considered unthinkable until recently. Both newspapers regularly referred to the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as a terrorist organization. `` There is something Oriental in the way -LRB- <LOCATION> Mandela </LOCATION> -RRB- has turned weakness into power,'' said the anti-apartheid Business Day, the leading financial daily. `` He has achieved much by doing virtually nothing, forcing his jailers progressively to ease the conditions of his release,'' the editorial added. `` It is not too much to say that the government is now the prisoner of its prisoner: it can not escape his embrace.'' The government has said <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, founder of the congress' guerrilla wing, must renounce violence before he can be freed But <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> this year has suggested those terms may be eased. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, serving a life sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government, has said he will not disavow violence until his organization is legalized and apartheid is dismantled.

 Consumers are seeing more pork this year and some easing of prices at meat counters, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. `` Hog producers have experienced a steep drop in returns over the past year but have made only a modest cutback in hog numbers,'' the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. Commercial output of pork for all of 1989 is estimated at 15.9 billion pounds, up 2 percent from last year and the most since 1980, the agency reported. Market prices of hogs going to slaughter are expected to average $ 40 to $ 43 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 43 in 1988. The all-cut retail price of pork may be around $ 1.80 per pound in 1989, down 3 to 5 cents per pound from last year's average, the report said.

<TEXT>
 People are shooting at towns and roads and setting up roadblocks to disrupt traffic in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a disputed territory swept by ethnic violence last year, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. An Armenian motorist was found shot to death on a road leading to <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, and ethnic <PERSON> Azerbaijanis </PERSON> `` started a pogrom'' in the city of <PERSON> Shusha </PERSON>, the official news agency reported. Rioters destroyed a store and the airport dispatcher's office in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, the territorial capital, it said. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> report said roving bands erected barriers on many roads, and `` bus connections between <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> and other towns have been interrupted. Automobile traffic into the territory is blockaded.'' Soviet central authorities have sent a group of ranking police and internal affairs officials to direct law enforcement in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, where ethnic conflict started riots last year that killed more than 90 people in the neighboring southern republics of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. Ethnic Armenians, most of them Christians, make up three-quarters of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s population, but the fertile region was assigned in 1923 to <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, a predominantly Moslem republic. It is about 1,200 miles south of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that one man was hospitalized because of the trouble in <PERSON> Shusha </PERSON>, but also quoted authorities as saying many injuries were not being reported. `` Recent days have been marked by people firing hunting guns on towns,'' it said. A highway checkpoint in the Askeransky region was shot at Thursday night, according to <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, and officers at another were fired on when they sought to check the documents of a truck with no license plate. Because of the roadblocks, `` bus connections between <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> and other towns have been interrupted,'' the news agency reported. `` Automobile traffic into the territory is blockaded.'' In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Timokhin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Artur </PERSON> <PERSON> Toniyan </PERSON>, the Armenian found dead Wednesday on a road between two <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> villages, apparently was the victim of an ethnically motivated attack. Two Azerbaijanis were killed and a third seriously wounded Tuesday near <LOCATION> Kirkidzhan </LOCATION> village. There were conflicting reports that Armenians ambushed the men, that they died in a car accident or killed each other in a fight. A 1 a.m.-5 a.m. curfew is in force in the territory, a 2-month-old strike is keeping most businesses closed and armored personnel carriers patrol the streets of <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> and other cities. Residents of the capital spoke in telephone interviews of rumors that <PERSON> Azerbaijanis </PERSON> attacked the ethnic Armenian village of <LOCATION> Dashpulag </LOCATION> on Wednesday. `` Two buses went there yesterday to help the wounded,'' said <PERSON> Armen </PERSON> <PERSON> Khachaturyan </PERSON>, who works at the <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> television station.

<HEAD>Judge Finds Mother Guilty on Drug Delivery to Newborns</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An addict who gave birth to two children with traces of cocaine in their system was convicted of drug delivery Thursday under a law routinely used against drug dealers. `` A derivative of cocaine which the defendant had introduced into her body passed into theirs'' through the umbilical cord, Circuit Judge O.H. <PERSON> Eaton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> ruled in the non-jury trial. <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarise </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 23, faces up to 30 years in prison, but prosecutor <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Deen </PERSON> said he would recommend that she continue in a drug-treatment program and receive a long period of probation. The single mother is believed to be the first person tried in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> under the drug-delivery law for transmitting drugs to a newborn. <PERSON> Deen </PERSON> said the verdict is `` a new tool for prosecutors to put a stop to this great problem in this state and in the nation.'' A key issue in the case was whether a newborn is a person after birth but before the umbilical cord is severed. The state made that argument to justify prosecution under a law making it a felony to deliver drugs to minors. The judge agreed. `` I am convinced and find that a child who is born but whose umbilical cord has not been severed is a ` person' within the intent and meaning'' of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law, the judge said. He also ruled that the term `` delivery'' includes passage of cocaine through the umbilical cord after birth, <PERSON> Eaton </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> refused to comment. Defense attorney <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweeting </PERSON> said he would appeal, noting the judge invited review by appellate courts and the Legislature. <PERSON> Sweeting </PERSON> said the ruling was a signal to pregnant addicts to avoid prenatal care and to give birth to their babies outside of a hospital. `` I think what we found today is that having a baby's a crime for pregnant addicts,'' he said. But judge said he believed the opposite to be true _ that pregnant addicts are being put on notice that they have a responsibility to seek treatment. Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> gave birth to a boy in 1987 and a girl in January. Her aunt and mother care for the children, who are seemingly healthy. Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> lives at a drug treatment center in <LOCATION> Apopka </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sweeting </PERSON> had argued that the law was being bent to punish his client belatedly for her drug addiction and that the drug-delivery law was not meant for mothers, fetuses or newborns. `` This is a social policy issue,'' <PERSON> Sweeting </PERSON> told <PERSON> Eaton </PERSON>. `` Let's leave those issues to those elected to resolve them'' in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Legislature Arguing that a mother and child `` did not constitute two separate people at birth,'' <PERSON> Sweeting </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> `` did not physically deliver cocaine'' to her children. If it happened, he said, `` it was done by osmosis.''

<HEAD>House Panel Approves Medicaid Expansion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee on Thursday approved expansions in the Medicaid health-care program for the poor that would cost the federal government about $ 4 billion over five years. The expansions would bring into the federal-state program many of the pregnant women, infants and children who are not now covered and have no private health insurance. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> also unanimously approved a non-binding resolution calling for the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> program covering catastrophic illnesses to be made voluntary, saying <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can not ignore the outrage among the elderly over the program. Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the panel's health subcommittee, said, `` I think we need to make some changes in the catastrophic care program because so many people are upset. `` I do n't believe there's any other issue I've had people talk to me about,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Moorhead </PERSON>, R-Calif. Rep. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilirakis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>., who proposed the resolution, called the program a `` catastrophic catastrophe,'' under which many elderly citizens are being forced to pay for coverage they already have through their former employers and other The measures were approved 30-13 as part of a huge deficit-cutting package for fiscal year 1990, which begins Oct. 1. The package now moves to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The Medicaid expansions would add about $ 183 million to the projected $ 38 billion cost of the program in the next fiscal year. One change would require states to phase in over five years coverage of pregnant women and infants with incomes of up to 185 percent of the federal poverty level. The requirement would begin at 130 percent of poverty by April 1990, which is what the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has proposed, but would rise to 185 percent by July 1, 1993. A similar expansion has been proposed in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The committee shot down an attempt by Rep. <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ala </LOCATION>., to protect states like his own where the median income is low and a large proportion of residents live below the federal poverty line He said that under the proposed expansion, more than half of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s newborn children would become eligible for Medicaid at a prohibitive cost to the state, which shares in the cost of the program. Another expansion would phase in coverage of children in families with incomes below the federal poverty level, beginning July 1, 1990, with children born after Sept. 30, 1983. As long as these children remained poor, they would be covered by Medicaid. The committee also approved a change in the way physicians are paid under the Medicare program, replacing the current fee schedule with a new one based on such things as the skill, training and time required to perform a service. The fee structure is intended to correct inequities in the current system that reimburses specialists like surgeons and ophthalmologists at higher rates than general practitioners and internists whose services are mainly `` cognitive.'' The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has approved a similar plan, but included another change that would set an annual target for Medicare spending on physicians. Under the target, physician reimbursement rates could be lowered to recoup overspending of the target. The different versions are expected to be worked out in a conference committee later.

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> opened hearings on the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s flag-burning decision Thursday, with one lawmaker foreseeing violence if the decision is n't overturned and another decrying `` shameful and crass demagoguery'' by those trying to amend the Constitution `` We have to take action, otherwise people will be burning flags throughout the country on every holiday occasion,'' said Rep. G.V. `` Sonny'' <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>. `` If we do n't do something, I fear Americans, and especially veterans' groups, are going to stop the desecration of the flag in their own way and people are going to get hurt,'' he said. <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> is co-sponsor with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> GOP Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> of an amendment endorsed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to overcome last month's 5-4 decision by the court. The justices said burning the flag was a constitutionally protected form of political dissent. Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, a liberal Democrat from <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, took strong issue with those supporting a constitutional amendment. `` No amendment in our history has restricted individual freedom,'' he said. `` This is not the time to break faith with two centuries of tradition.'' <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> said the court ruling had triggered `` a crude form of political one-upmanship, a crass competition about who loves the flag more ... shameful and crass demagoguery, all with a cold eye toward the next election.'' Many politicians have been scrambling to embrace the flag issue since the court's ruling. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> quickly called for a constitutional amendment to overturn the ruling, but leading congressional Democrats have been pushing instead for a law that would address the issue without altering the Constitution. The argument played out Thursday at a hearing by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION>, the opening shot in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> over what is sure to be an extended debate. Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, urged the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel to approve legislation like his own bill, which could take effect almost immediately A constitutional amendment would require approval by the states after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> acted. But supporters of the proposed constitutional amendment said they doubted anything short of that would succeed. `` We believe there is no quick legislative fix,'' said <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, D-Miss., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the subcommittee should swiftly approve the amendment instead of tinkering with legal nuance which might still offend the court But subcommittee chairman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif., urged his colleagues to be cautious `` The flag is sturdy, flying proudly through every fierce battle of every war and through times of social upheaval,'' he said. `` The Constitution, however, is fragile and can be amended by the votes of legislators caught up in the emotional whirlwinds of the moment.'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> told reporters after the hearing that he believed more lawmakers were becoming leery of a constitutional amendment. Opponents of an amendment hope that by swiftly passing legislation on flag burning, perhaps by the August recess, they can further cool the fervor for an amendment. House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., said he and other lawmakers were finding their constituents were opposed to flag burning but also concerned about a constitutional amendment `` I find it encouraging, because it seems to me that people are calmly looking at the question of whether the Constitution should be amended, and I am glad that it is being examined with that calm,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sensenbrenner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the subcommittee, said he would fight attempts in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to `` obfuscate the issues with legal mumble-jumble.'' Lawmakers should respond to the will of the people, he said, distributing a <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> article with a poll saying 75 percent of those surveyed in his state favor an amendment. Rep. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, D-Colo., said the issue might be more complicated than it appears at first glance She held up for the television cameras various uses of the flag which might or might not be construed a desecration. She included a picture of herself wrapped in the flag which appeared on the cover of Ms. <PERSON> Magazine </PERSON>, and one of <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wearing a flag around her neck. `` I really wonder how we know which of these are desecrations and which are n't,'' she said.

 Millions chanting `` Death to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>!'' and beating themselves in grief surrounded the gold-domed tomb of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> on Thursday to end 40 days of mourning for the founder of the Islamic republic. His successor as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s religious leader, President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, appeared in public for the first time since <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s June 6 funeral and delivered a tirade against the `` terrorists'' of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies. The speeches by <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> and other Iranian leaders turned the religious ceremony into an rally against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, seen as <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>'s successor, was cheered when he appeared on a podium some distance from the grave, accompanied by bodyguards carrying automatic rifles <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s elder brother, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Morteza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasandideh </PERSON>, were also hailed by the crowd when they appeared on the podium. <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON>, 43, flanked by his weeping uncle, said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> should stand firm `` against plots in the region against us,'' an apparent reference to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s curb on Iranians from making the annual pilgrimage to Mecca that climaxed Thursday. As the representative of <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s family, he declared the mourning period over. Iranian media monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> said `` millions'' of people rhythmically thumping their chests and heads in a ritualized frenzy of grief packed an area 1 -LCB- miles deep around the shrine in the Behesht-e <PERSON> Zahra </PERSON> cemetery outside <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. There was no independent estimate of the crowd, but aerial views shown on Iranian television indicated it was as big as the gathering at <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s funeral, which authorities estimated was attended by 10 million people. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> died June 3 at the age of 86, 10 years after his Islamic revolution toppled <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>. Iranian TV showed swarms of wailing mourners pressing around <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s shrine, which is considered sacred. They believed <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s blessing and protection would be bestowed on anyone who touches the temporary square monument that has been constructed over <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s grave. The official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said 10,000 people collapsed with `` heart problems'' or were injured in the suffocating throng. Another 10,000 were overcome by the 110-degree temperatures, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said. The live broadcast from the cemetery 10 miles south of the capital showed those who had collapsed being handed by other mourners over the heads of the crowd to first aid teams waiting on the fringes. Iranian media reported many were in serious condition even after treatment at 50 medical stations set up along roads leading to the cemetery. Firefighters sprayed water on the people to cool them down as loudspeakers blared readings from the Koran, Islam's holy book. Many traveled from across the country before Thursday's ceremonies to keep an all-night vigil around the shrine, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported Only low-ranking officials from a few countries attended Thursday's ceremonies. Major world leaders also shunned <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s funeral <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> denied <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was behind the bombings in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> on Monday that killed one person and wounded 16 during the pilgrimage. `` If exporting the revolution means exporting explosives, and creating havoc among other nations, then this accusation is far from the hands of the Islamic republic,'' he said. `` Exporting mischief and corruption belongs to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and ... other aggressive governments,'' he declared. `` The hands of the <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and its underlings ... are stained with the blood of innocents. They are the terrorists. The Islamic republic is absolved of these allegations.'' Thursday's scene was similar to the mass outpouring of grief at <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s funeral, when at least eight people died and 11,000 were injured as frenzied crowds struggled to catch a glimpse of his shrouded body. But this time the authorities were better prepared and organization was more evident, with medical tents, a fleet of 600 buses, centers for lost children and enough food for 10 million. This time, mourners were also covered against death and injury by a special government insurance scheme. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s state-run insurance companies announced that the equivalent of $ 13,500 will be paid to the family of anyone killed or seriously injured in the service. Medical expenses of up to $ 2,000 also will be paid. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said 7,000 workers toiled since the funeral to erect the monument over the grave and levelled a a 43-acre area around it to accomodate the hundreds of thousands who gather there every day.

 If President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lays down a major new challenge for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> space exploration next week <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> wo n't be ready, the new head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. `` Today's <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> ca n't do it,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truly </PERSON> in his first news conference as <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s administrator. `` We have been through several years of very marginal funding,'' he said. `` We have a lot on our plate and to take on new challenges would require buttressing the facilities and the people to do the job.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> has urged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to announce a national goal of establishing a settlement on the moon in his speech July 20 commemorating the first landing on the moon 20 years ago, just as President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> established a moon landing target nearly 30 years earlier. `` Any new goal in whatever year is going to require adequate resources to do it,'' said Truly. `` Given the adequate resources, I think <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> is very strong and I think that we have a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> that can be built upon to take on major new challenges. But I'll tell you this: Today's <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> ca n't do it.'' Truly denied a published report that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, of which he is a member, has decided to make a formal recommendation for such a major effort when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> returns from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> next week. Earlier Thursday, however, Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> briefed about a dozen congressmen about `` a major new initiative'' the council is considering. `` They basically outlined three options,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, R-Pa., the ranking Republican member of the House Space Science Subcommittee `` One, for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to move ahead with a robotic program and gradually phase men out of the space program; another to go back to the moon ... and then going from there to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>, and third, to take us directly to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> after the turn of the century.'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said the council was trying to decide among the three options before making a recommendation to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He said the preferred option, as it was outlined to the congressmen, `` is the mission that would take us back to the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION>, establish a permanent base some time after the first of the century and to Mars within the first decade.'' `` It will require doubling the size of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> budget,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. The space agency has asked for $ 13 billion in the next fiscal year. Truly said a new government ethics law that goes into effect on Sunday along with a pay cap on senior executives has cost his agency several top managers and has created `` a very disturbing situation.'' `` I think this ethics legislation has caused us to lose an inordinate number compared to the average,'' he said. `` There are people who have left who could have given us three or four more years of service and that's a crying shame,'' he said. He spoke a day after <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aller </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION>, quit suddenly _ the ninth high-level agency resignation this year. <PERSON> Aller </PERSON> was the third to say publicly he is leaving because of the ethics law. `` We know of a few others who are making their final decisions today and tomorrow literally,'' Truly said. `` It's not so much the number, but the quality and experience of these people,'' he said. `` When 10 senior service executive people leave you, they take with them 250 to 300 years of government leadership and experience when they walk out the door.'' Truly said it is `` an unhealthy situation'' to have a public service that people ca n't afford to work for. `` That's not a good situation,'' he said, `` and it's one we need to deal with.''

 The rescue team aboard the HC-130 Hercules that participated in Thursday's dramatic water rescue of a stricken pilot is composed of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> reservists trained to `` bring'em back alive,'' a spokesman said. `` We're called weekend warriors, and we're really not,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubiel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dubiel </PERSON>, interviewed by telephone from the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Headquarters </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Robins </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, said the rescuers came from the <ORGANIZATION> 301st </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recovery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squad </ORGANIZATION>, based at <ORGANIZATION> Homestead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s east coast. The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> unit, composed of 235 reservists, is one of three such rescue teams based around the country. The others are based near <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and near <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, he said. The three squads have racked up more than 400 military and civilian saves, or rescues, over the past 10 years, <PERSON> Dubiel </PERSON> said. `` They've been trained to bring'em back alive,'' he said. `` We do all kinds of things _ we search for lost hikers on mountaintops. We provide standby rescue support for the space launches,'' <PERSON> Dubiel </PERSON> said. From the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> base, the crews `` are regularly called to assist the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>,'' he said. The parachutists are specially trained to dive into the ocean to make their rescues. And not only do the resuers have to be trained medically to assist victims in distress, `` they have to know how to pull them from the water, pluck them off a mountian if they have to,'' <PERSON> Dubiel </PERSON> said. `` They have to be in super condition.'' The job of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> _ composed of some 82,000 people _ is to augment the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in crises and in peacetime and provide backup and `` daily support'' to the military force, <PERSON> Dubiel </PERSON> said. A certain percentage of the reservists are on duty full time. <PERSON> Dubiel </PERSON> said they tend to bristle at the idea that they are called to duty only part-time or on the weekends. Of the six crewmen aboard the HC-130 and the four parachutists who dove into the water, only the co-pilot is a part-time reservist, <PERSON> Dubiel </PERSON> said. The HC-130 is a four-engine turboprop plane that has been outfitted specifically for search and rescue missions. It can also refuel helicopters in flight. On Thursday, six crewmen and four parachutists aboard the plane participated in the rescue, and all were from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dubiel </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has released a Taiwanese fishing vessel held in <LOCATION> Midway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> agreed to prosecute its captain and crewmembers on charges of illegal driftnet fishing and trying to bribe <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said Thursday. `` We have assurances from the president and prime minister -LRB- of <LOCATION> Tawian </LOCATION> -RRB- that both counts will be prosecutued to the maximum extent possible under their laws,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, the department's ambassador for oceans and fisheries The Ta Chieh No. 3 left for <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> on Saturday after being detained at Midway for several weeks while the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Taiwanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> worked out details of its release and the prosecution. A <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> party, suspecting illegal fishing, boarded the Ta Chieh No. 3 with permission on July 6, and was offered gold, money, alcohol and sexual favors in return for ignoring the violations. When the bribes were turned down, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials said, the vessel's captain ordered the boarding party to leave. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel were allowed to reboard the ship two days later and found a ship's log that indicated the vessel had been fishing in prohibited waters for at least three years. The <PERSON> Midgett </PERSON> then escorted the <ORGANIZATION> Ta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chieh </ORGANIZATION> to Midway while the two nation's negotiated over its release and the prosecution of the captain and crew. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials had previsouly said the incident helped prompt the Taiwanese to the negotiating table and eventually led to a tentative monitoring and enforcement agreement for <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> driftnet fishing. The agreement will allow <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials to board Tawianese vessels suspected of illegal fishing on the high seas and will require that all Taiwanese driftnet vessels be equipped with satellite transponders in 1990.

 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has arrested three members of the <ORGANIZATION> Provisional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and accused them of developing devices to set off for remote-controlled bombs to be used against British targets, the agency announced Thursday. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Nashua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Harwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, 27, a citizen of the <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> who has been living since April in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Sunnyvale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, were arrested Wednesday by agents in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. The three face federal charges of conspiracy to injure and destroy the property of a foreign government, specifically <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. Details on bail and the current status of the three were not immediately available, said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> said in a statement that the three had backgrounds in electrical engineering and were developing highly sophisticated circuits to be used in remote-controlled explosive devices. The arrests, Sessions said, `` demonstrate the high level of technical sophistication being employed by terrorist organizations to further violence worldwide.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> will continue its investigation into the organization to try to identify other operatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Provisional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PIRA </ORGANIZATION>, in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he said.

In affidavits filed Wednesday in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Courts in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in support of search warrants, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> detailed the <ORGANIZATION> PIRA </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to obtain devices known as tone frequency switches, which are electronic encoders that allow radio commands to detonate explosives.

Since then, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> authorities have recovered at least six switches in unexploded PIRA bombs in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.

 Old-style swat teams have n't worked, so <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> scientists are trying new tactics to curb flies where the nation's farms meet the cities. `` We've seen instances all over the country where urban encroachment in agricultural areas has caused problems for homeowners and agricultural producers,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bram </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Cities are sprawling into the countryside at an estimated rate of 900,000 to 1.5 million acres a year, he said Thursday in an agency report. And to the newcomers, flies and barnyard odors are n't part of their idyllic country dream. Some flies can travel great distances from manure piles or other barnyard breeding places to find targets. The stable fly can migrate up to 135 miles. <PERSON> Bram </PERSON> is the national program leader for insects affecting humans at the agency's research facility in <LOCATION> Beltsville </LOCATION>, Md. `` We have to learn how to increase non-chemical fly control and how to make the save chemicals we have work better,'' he said. `` It goes beyond relying on screen doors, sprays and swatters.'' Possible tactics include non-chemical baits in traps to lure flies; natural predators such as wasps that prey on flies while in their pupa stage of development; and natural organisms such as fungi and bacteria that attack flies in cattle feedlots. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> attack is directed at four main kinds of flies: _ Stable flies, which have biting mouth parts and feed on blood _ House flies, which secrete digestive enzymes onto their food, then suck up both enzymes and food _ Horn flies, which bother only livestock on pastures and rangeland _ Face flies, also pests of livestock, but an annoyance to homeowners in the fall Stable flies and house flies from farms are the major problem species for homeowners, said <PERSON> Gustave </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, an entomologist and research leader at the agency's <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livestock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> laboratory, <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. `` In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the stable fly is estimated to cost $ 400 million annually in damage to cattle,'' he said. `` It's hard to put a dollar value on the damage caused by the house fly. But worldwide, this fly may rank in the top 10 insect problems because it can transmit a lot of diseases.''

<HEAD>Siberian Coal Miners End Strike After Gov't Agrees to Better Conditions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAREY GOLDBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 12,000 striking Siberian coal miners agreed Thursday to return to work after the government agreed to provide better work and living conditions, mine officials and strikers said. The two-day strike began Tuesday at all five mines in <LOCATION> Mezhdurechensk </LOCATION>, prompting <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials to rush to the western Siberian town of 107,000 to settle the dispute, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda said. Strikers said Thursday they were satisfied with government concessions that included better night-shift pay, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON>, a member of the government commission negotiating with the strikers. Strikes are becoming more common in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, where they once were considered a Western phenomenon brought on by capitalist exploitation of workers. Strikes used to be brutally repressed and hushed up, but this year miners' strikes have generally ended within days with government concessions. Night-shift workers at the Shevyakov mine began the strike Monday, and it spread Tuesday to about 12,000 workers citywide, Pravda said. The newspaper described the strikers' demands sympathetically, including calls for round-the-clock cafeteria service, meat and sausage for underground workers, free soap, one free towel per month and a quilted jacket in winter. The strikers' 30 demands included economic independence for the mines, extended vacations for underground workers and improved food and housing, the labor daily <ORGANIZATION> Trud </ORGANIZATION> reported. Calls for greater financial independence of individual mines and for increased night-shift pay were among those immediately granted, said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolmagorov </PERSON>, a worker at the Shevyakov mine. Requests for better food supplies and housing will take more time, <PERSON> Kolmagorov </PERSON> said by telephone from the mine's strike headquarters. `` People are back at work,'' <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON> said. `` All their demands are legal and are being decided. Most of them are satisfied, but some will take time.'' Trud said the demands resulted from long years of neglect by authorities interested only in coal production and not in the miners' needs. <PERSON> Mezhdurechensk </PERSON>, about 1,600 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, produces 30 million tons of high-quality coal per year, Trud said. In a bitter letter Trud published in January, <PERSON> Mezhdurechensk </PERSON> miners complained that 10,000 families are waiting for apartments; hospitals and clinics are as crowded `` as anthills,'' with patients waiting a week or more to see a doctor; and schools are overcrowded. The situation was aggravated when the ministry recently took away two housing complexes from miners to accommodate other workers, Trud said. A top Soviet official said in May that new legislation is being drafted that will give unions the legal right to strike. Similar strikes were reported in March and April in the Urals Mountain city of <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION> and the Siberian city of <ORGANIZATION> Norilsk </ORGANIZATION> but both ended without incident.

 Former Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> on Thursday married the woman with whom he once had a secret relationship that contributed to his ouster in last month's elections <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, 70, wed <PERSON> Dimitra </PERSON> <PERSON> Liani </PERSON>, a 35-year-old former airline stewardess, were wed in the evening in this northern <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> suburb. The wedding was put off twice because of <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s ill health. He was released from an <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> hospital on July 6 after two weeks of treatment for pneumonia and a kidney ailment. Nine months earlier, he underwent open heart surgery in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. His relationship with Ms. <PERSON> Liani </PERSON> became public at that time, when he was seen at the hospital holding hands with her. He was married then to the former <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Chant </PERSON>, but he divorced his American-born wife of 38 years several days before the June 18 elections. His Panhellenic Socialist Movement was swept from office in that vote amid controversy over his personal life and a series of financial scandals. Conservative and communist opponents allied to form an interim government. Parliament, which is now controlled by that alliance, on voted Thursday to investigate a former official in <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s administration who is accused in one of the scandals <PERSON> Nikos </PERSON> <PERSON> Athanasopoulos </PERSON>, former deputy finance minister, is accused of arranging for a shipment of 9,000 tons of <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> corn to be issued with Greek certificates of origin in 1986 and sold to a member state of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> by a Greek state company. The European Court ruled against <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> in May this year, citing lost revenues of $ 2 million that should have been paid on corn imported from a non-member country. A special committee of 12 Greek legislators will investigate the charges against <PERSON> Athanasopoulos </PERSON> and decide whether the former minister should stand trial in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Athanasopoulos </PERSON>, who was not re-elected, has denied involvement in the scandal. The coalition government has pledged to investigate and punish those involved in scandals in banking, the arms industry, and alleged phone-tapping by the <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> administration. About 50 people attended <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s Greek Orthodox ceremony at the church of <LOCATION> Panagia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eleftherotria </LOCATION>. They included ranking members of his party, Ms. <PERSON> Liani </PERSON>'s relatives and journalists. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> looked drawn but dapper in a dark suit and silver tie. Upon arriving in a chauffeur-driven car, he waved at hundreds of supporters who had gathered at the entrance chanting `` Long live our Andreas!'' Minutes later, he walked into the church with Ms. <PERSON> Liani </PERSON>, who was wearing a white strapless gown and a veil of white lace. The couple did not kiss as the priest declared them man and wife. But as they drove off, <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> obligingly leaned over for photographers and kissed Ms. <PERSON> Liani </PERSON> on the lips. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s four adult children did not attend. Ms. <PERSON> Liani </PERSON> divorced her husband, <PERSON> Alexis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kapopoulos </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member, earlier this year after her relationship with <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> became public.

<HEAD>Dukakis Outlines $491 Million In Cuts; Says Tax Hike Unlikely</HEAD>

 Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> cut nearly half a billion dollars from the state budget Thursday in a move he said was made necessary by `` miscalculations, mistakes and misinformation.'' He said the needy would be hurt the most, and he renewed his call for a tax increase. The spending cuts in the $ 12.3 billion budget include a $ 210 million reduction in aid to cities and towns, a freeze in welfare benefits and a $ 62 million cut in public and higher education spending. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, whose state's budget problems have called into question the `` <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Miracle'' he touted during his Democratic run for the presidency, had argued for six months for tax increases to avoid such cuts. The House has given initial approval to a $ 744 million tax increase, but that is a temporary, two-year hike that only pays leftover bills from the fiscal year that ended June 30. The cuts made by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> are for the new fiscal year. The state constitution effectively requires a balanced budget. `` All of us in state government have arrived at this unhappy moment through a combination of miscalculations, mistakes and misinformation,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` I'm disappointed in myself for not being more effective and persuasive. I'm disappointed in the Legislature's failure to send me a balanced budget. I'm disappointed in all of us who have let the talkmasters and the columnists define our values, our commitment to public service, our commitment to each other.'' The mood was somber as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> outlined the cuts before about 700 state employees, lobbyists and others who packed a Statehouse auditorium. `` This state is bankrupt and somebody better realize it,'' <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said afterward. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is going to be finished business in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> insisted the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s budget understated expenses by about $ 351 million and overestimated revenue by $ 140 million. He used his line-item veto authority and his power to withhold funding to cut the budget. Targets of cuts include human services; aid for the mentally ill; environmental programs, and the state AIDS program. Of the $ 491 million in vetoes and `` conditional cuts'' that would be restored if money becomes available, the $ 210 million local and school aid reduction is most likely to generate controversy. Communities depend on the state for about 40 percent of their revenue for everything from schools to police and fire protection. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxation </ORGANIZATION>, said of higher taxes: `` It is n't going to happen. There are n't going to be any more taxes than they've already done.''

<HEAD>Scientology Case Sent to National Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A $ 2.3 million fraud and tax evasion case against the <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> has been sent to a national court after a district judge ruled it was too big for his jurisdiction, court sources said Thursday. Scientology President <PERSON> Heber </PERSON> <PERSON> Jentzsch </PERSON> and 10 others arrested in a police raid on a <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> hotel in November remain free on bail pending formal charging in connection with the case. <PERSON> Jentzsch </PERSON>, now in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, must report to court officials July 18, the sources said. In a 41-page court order issued Wednesday, <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> 21st District Court Judge <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Honrubia </PERSON> said his nine-month investigation showed that Scientology officials in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> had violated 13 laws. The Spanish <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> twice has denied the church status as a religious entity. The accusations included massive fraud, document forgery, operating without a license, illicit association and several public health violations. Several church-related organizations, including the drug rehabilitation program Narconon, were named in the court order, which <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Honrubia </PERSON> remanded to the investigative division of the national court. The national court must now decide whether to accept the case. If it refuses, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> will decide which court has jurisdiction. A lawyer for three of the accused said he was pleased the case would be in the hands of another, `` less obsessed judge.'' `` The accusations reflect religious prejudice and are closer to science fiction than penal reality,'' said the lawyer, <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON>. Lawyers for <PERSON> Jentzsch </PERSON> and the others have filed several complaints of bias against <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Honrubia </PERSON>, who drew national attention for his handling of the case after the Nov. 20, 1988 arrests. <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Honrubia </PERSON> said the investigation was `` far from complete.'' Police arrested 71 people in the raid, 60 of whom were released by the judge after questioning. <PERSON> Jentzsch </PERSON> and the others spent 20 days in jail before <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Honrubia </PERSON> agreed to free them Dec. 10 on a combined bail of $ 1.1 million. The court document described the Church of Scientology and its sister organizations as making up `` a multinational dedicated to sales of goods and services, courses and classes.'' The judge said the organizations promise `` mental and physical health based on totally unscientific theories in order to obtain growing sums of money from captive -LRB- adherents -RRB-.'' The order said the organizations defrauded Spanish tax authorities of the equivalent of $ 1.71 million between 1985 and 1988. It also said investigators received complaints against the groups from 95 people in 10 Spanish provinces alleging personal and material damages totaling $ 632,000. At the time of the arrests, <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Honrubia </PERSON> blocked church bank accounts holding $ 900,000. The Church of Scientology, founded in the 1950s by American science fiction author <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>, is based on <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>'s 1949 book, `` Dianetics: The <ORGANIZATION> Modern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>.''

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s foreign secretary met with a <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> official Thursday and urged the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to follow a moderate line despite `` disappointing'' moves in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> reported. It said Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>'s 10-minute meeting with <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> was the first between a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> officer and a senior <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official. <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> told reporters afterward it was a `` very important political meeting, especially at this delicate moment in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, due to the decisions taken by the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> party giving a blow to peace efforts.'' Last week, the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> set new Israeli conditions for elections in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. They are expected to make Palestinian acceptance of the elections less likely. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s deputy foreign minister, <PERSON> Benyamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON>, said in a television interview the <LOCATION> Howe-Sharif </LOCATION> meeting was `` a setback not only for genuine peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, but ... for British policy against terrorism.'' Despite the its public renunciation of terrorism and recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist, he said, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> supports terrorist activity and openly declares in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> that it plans to destroy the Jewish state. The Board of Deputies of British <ORGANIZATION> Jews </ORGANIZATION> said it had `` strongly protested'' to <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> was invited last week to confer with Minister of State <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldegrave </PERSON>, whom he last met in May. After 35 minutes with <PERSON> Waldegrave </PERSON>, he was taken to see <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>. A Foreign Office spokesman said the purpose was for <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> `` to encourage the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to stick to its moderate policy despite the disappointing outcome of the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> meeting and the rising tide of violence in the occupied territories.'' More than 550 Palestinians and 35 Israelis have been killed during a 19-month-old uprising against Israeli rule in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s new conditions for elections, which would choose Palestinians to negotiate peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, demand that the uprising end before they are held and specify that Palestinians in <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> can not participate.

 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials who lack the gumption to respond to the passionate demands and complaints of Soviet citizens should quit, President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in a speech reported Thursday. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> offered that blunt opinion to <ORGANIZATION> Leningrad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders Wednesday just before they sacked their local party chief, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solovyov </PERSON>, a candidate member of the ruling Politburo. `` Passions are boiling on the streets, but in many party organizations there is silence,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in his speech, which was released by the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> Thursday. `` It is necessary to quickly blast out this silence, this dangerous silence! `` It is necessary to face life, to go into life. Whoever does n't have the strength, whoever can not find his place, let him leave,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said `` Before anything else, we must think of the party, of perestroika, of socialism.'' Perestroika, or restructuring, is <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s campaign to overhaul Soviet society and the economy. Although <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> never mentioned <PERSON> Solovyov </PERSON> by name, he was clearly referring to him. When Soviet election law was reformed to allow multiple candidates, <PERSON> Solovyov </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> leaders engineered their parliamentary races to run unopposed. Then they suffered humiliating defeats when angry citizens crossed their names off ballots, denying them the required 50 percent approval. <PERSON> Solovyov </PERSON> also ignored calls for his resignation and the issues raised during the election campaign, which brought thousands of Leningraders into the streets for public meetings. In his speech, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> charged that the <ORGANIZATION> Leningrad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> failed to pay attention to the roots of people's complaints, in particular their demand for practical results from perestroika The party, he indicated, must defend itself through its actions. As an example, he cited local authorities for failing to improve a particular factory's working conditions. He said the conditions were like those facing laborers in the time of <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> the </PERSON> <PERSON> Great </PERSON>, who founded <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> in 1703. `` They've been talking about ventilation for two years, and they can not put it right. The dust is terrible, the conditions unbearable. It's shameful! `` Well, comrades, for this, you need billions?'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> asked rhetorically. `` So people look at this and say, ` Perestroika has been going on for four years, and nothing has changed. This is where we get irritation, indignation and criticism,'' he said. `` Where is their -LRB- official -RRB- union? Where is their party organization?'' Local authorities often blame <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for failing to solve purely local problems `` which the central government does n't handle, and should n't handle,'' he said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also told his audience not to fear new ideas _ a failing he had previously found in <PERSON> Solovyov </PERSON>. In April, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> reprimanded the <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> party chief for complaining that the party was becoming `` a discussion club.'' The current period of change, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said Wednesday, brings forth diverse opinions, `` which many people perceive as a threat to what we have achieved, as a threat to perestroika. Comrades, we must preserve our strength of spirit, our tolerance, our realism in evaluating the progress of perestroika, in predictions for the future.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted Thursday to speed up elimination of the tax deduction for interest on consumer loans in order to keep a tax break for bankers and corporate executives. The quicker loss of the interest deduction will affect about 24 million couples and individuals. The other part of the bargain is expected to benefit a few dozen people, committee aides said. The panel, working on a broad package of tax changes, rejected an effort to delay the new surtax that older Americans pay for catastrophic health insurance. That change would have been financed, in turn, by cutting the tax on capital gains. That combination of changes, proposed by Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Archer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, was defeated on a 25-11 vote. All Democrats and Republican Reps. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gradison </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> opposed it. However, committee aides said the panel appears ready to make some significant change in the financing of catastrophic insurance, since many older Americans have been vocal in their opposition to the present law. Aides also indicated there still is considerable sentiment among members to make some reduction in the capital-gains tax, even though chairman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., has ruled out a reduction on the grounds that his Democratic troops wo n't support it The committee completed action on the assembly of $ 5.3 billion worth of deficit-reduction revenue increases that it is under orders from the <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to produce for the budget years that begins Oct. 1. However, work will continue next week on a variety of other tax proposals, including catastrophic medical insurance, capital gains and child care. By a voice vote, the panel overturned a decision taken 24 hours earlier and eliminated from the package an increase in taxes on snuff and pipe and chewing tobacco. The three products would have been taxed at $ 2.67 a pound; snuff now is taxed at 24 cents; pipe tobacco at 45 cents and chewing tobacco at 8 cents. In place of those increases, the committee voted to speed up collection of taxes from dividends received from mutual funds. Instead of being liable for taxes on the date a dividend is received, a shareowner would have to pay from the time the dividend is declared. The biggest single revenue-raiser, affecting corporations that use employee stock-ownership plans to avoid takeover and banks that lend to them, was scaled back. It was to finance part of that retreat that the committee agreed to a quicker end to deductions for interest on consumer loans. Under the 1986 tax reform legislation, those deductions have been reduced year by year on their way to complete elimination. This year only 20 percent of interest paid on loans for automobiles, education and credit cards is deductible. That had been scheduled to drop next year to 10 percent. Under the committee's action, the interest deduction would die at the end of this year. The committee wants to reduce two existing tax benefits connected with ESOPs, under which workers are given shares of the companies where they are employed. Under the committee's action Thursday, a banker that lends to an <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION> will be allowed to continue avoiding tax on half the interest earned from such loans only if the <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION> owns 30 percent or more of the corporation. The same 30 percent test would be applied before a corporation could take a tax deduction for certain dividends paid on <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION> stock. A second change would make the new rule effective on July 10 _ more than a month later than the committee originally had agreed to. This change would allow dozens of corporations that are in the processing of setting up ESOPs to qualify for treatment under the old rules. Most of the provisions in the committee's deficit-reduction plan are technical changes that generally affect only corporations.

 The last two of three <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> paintings stolen from a museum last year were recovered Thursday, Dutch television and other news reports said. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s 1887 work `` Wilted Sunflowers'' and an early version of his famous `` Potato Eaters'' painted in 1885 were recovered, slightly damaged, the national news agency reported. Recovery of the paintings, whose total value has been estimated at $ 72 million to $ 90 million, followed the arrests in recent weeks of four people suspected in the Dec. 12, 1988, theft from the <LOCATION> Kroeller-Mueller </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION>, 13 miles from <PERSON> Ede </PERSON>. In April, the thieves returned the third stolen painting, the Dutch impressionist's 1884 work `` The Loom,'' in an attempt to enforce a ransom demand of $ 2.2 million for the others. According to the agency report, the paintings were delivered to police Thursday afternoon by the lawyer for one suspect. The lawyer was not identified and police refused to confirm the report. The news agency said the four arrests followed another ransom demand made early last month, but did not give a figure or say whether any money had been paid. None of the four suspects, aged 22-37, has been identified, in keeping with Dutch police practice. Two have been released pending charges, the agency report said. The thieves smashed a 6-foot-wide hole in a window of the Kroeller-Mueller Museum, in a remote location in the middle of a large national park near the village of <LOCATION> Otterlo </LOCATION>. Police, stymied by an almost total lack of clues, put the case on the back burner. In March, after several months of silence, the thieves contacted museum director R.W.D. Oxenaar to demand the ransom. On April 6, <PERSON> Oxenaar </PERSON> received a telephone call at his home from a man who said `` The Loom,'' valued at $ 18 million to $ 22 million, could be found in the trunk of a car parked nearby. The painting, wrapped in a blanket, was found with only a few scratches so minute that officials first thought it had not been damaged at all. A few days later, a caller told <PERSON> Oxenaar </PERSON> to have a driver standing by with the money, but the ransom exchange fell through. Art experts had speculated the paintings would be held for ramsom because they are so well-known that they would be virtually unsellable on the open market. The final and most famous version of `` Potato Eaters,'' also dated 1885, is on display at the <ORGANIZATION> Vincent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> van </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gogh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>. The museum has the largest collection of works by the impressionist, who lived from 1853 to 1890.

<TEXT>
 The chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> narcotics subcommittee, attacking the anti-drug campaigns of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administrations as `` phony,'' proposed a $ 120 million program Thursday to help local police establish and expand drug intelligence units. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., introduced legislation to provide direct aid to local police departments for computers, electronic intelligence-gathering equipment and added personnel for anti-drug task forces `` It's time we gave police officers ... the kind of support they deserve,'' <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` We would be expanding the kind of police work which prevents drug-related crime from happening in the first place.'' The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations narcotics subcommittee said $ 63 million would go to state governments _ at least $ 500,000 to each state _ for drug intelligence units and equipment. About two-fifths of that money would be passed on to cities with fewer than 100,000 people. The rest of the money, $ 57 million, would go directly from the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to big cities. <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said the Drug Intelligence Act would `` provide an extra boost to local police departments at a time when their budgets are the tightest but their needs in fighting a real war on drugs are the greatest.'' `` Police drug intelligence units that already exist in major cities are important components in the war on drugs,'' he said. `` But even where these units exist, they need upgrading and more equipment.'' <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, deriding the anti-drug efforts of <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> administrations through the 1980s, said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has spent only $ 500 million of the $ 2.7 billion <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> allocated last year for the government's anti-drug effort. `` We do n't have a real war on drugs today,'' <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said. `` They're talking out of both sides of their mouth. ... It's phony.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> uncorked three days of bicentennial hoopla Thursday by inaugurating a gleaming, high-tech opera house at the site of the Bastille, the despised prison where its revolution began. President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and their wives sat in front-row balcony seats at the Opera Bastille for an opening concert featuring singers <PERSON> Placido </PERSON> <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendricks </PERSON>. Also present were 32 other presidents and prime ministers who came to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> for this weekend's celebrations of the revolution's 200th anniversary and for the annual summit of the world's seven richest countries Sharpshooters were posted on rooftops and in windows of buildings surrounding the <LOCATION> Place </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> la </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bastille </LOCATION> as the leaders arrived. Authorities have clamped tight and highly visible security around the capital this week. Later Thursday, more than 100,000 people jammed into the large circular plaza for the beginning of the largest of about 30,000 outdoor popular balls around the country to celebrate Bastille Day on Friday. Surrounding streets were packed with people of all ages, enjoying the balmy summer night. The air was filled with the smell of grilling sausages and the sounds of exploding firecrackers and accordion music pouring from a giant white tent opposite the new Opera. `` I usually prefer smaller parties, but I wanted to come be part of the most popular of French celebrations,'' said <PERSON> Gilles </PERSON> <PERSON> Driate </PERSON>, from a southeastern suburb. He then grabbed the hand of a surprised and delighted lady with gray hair, and they danced away. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and his guests had a late dinner at the <ORGANIZATION> Musee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> d'Orsay </ORGANIZATION>, the spectacular museum of 19th century art converted from a train station. Earlier in the day at the Opera Bastille, the political leaders were joined by a star-studded crowd including actress <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Deneuve </PERSON>, tennis player <PERSON> Yannick </PERSON> <PERSON> Noah </PERSON>, and Nobel Peace Prize-winning author <PERSON> Elie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiesel </PERSON>. A rousing orchestral rendition of the Marseillaise, the French national anthem, opened the show. The 75-minute program ended with an even more stirring version, with all the performers joining in. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, smiling broadly, applauded enthusiastically as the show closed. The visiting leaders earlier joined <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> in an outdoor ceremony honoring the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen proclaimed in 1789. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> was flanked by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the Trocadero, across the Seine from the Eiffel Tower, during the brief celebration of what many consider the chief legacy of the French Revolution. At the new opera house, <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendricks </PERSON> and <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Berganza </PERSON> sang selections from French operas such as <PERSON> Charles-Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Gounod </PERSON>'s `` Faust'' and <PERSON> Camille </PERSON> <PERSON> Saint-Saen </PERSON>'s `` <PERSON> Samson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Delila </PERSON>.'' <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Pretre </PERSON> conducted the orchestra and chorus of the Orchestre de <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in a work titled `` La Nuit d'avant le Jour,'' or `` The Night Before the Day.'' The staging and the stark, elegant decor were the work of American <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, the darling of French avant-garde theater. The Opera Bastille was conceived early in <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s first presidential term as a much-needed alternative to the ornate but inadequate <PERSON> Palais </PERSON> <PERSON> Garnier </PERSON>, known worldwide as the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Opera. From the start, the project was beset with administrative, political and financial problems, and it even came close to being canceled. Designed by Canadian architect <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Ott </PERSON>, the huge glass-and-steel building boasts state-of-the-art sound, lighting and staging technology, including special acoustical fire curtains, a movable proscenium and electronically controlled stage dollies that bring in sets for an entire opera in minutes. The 2,700-seat main auditorium _ a contemporary blend of black and white with oak-paneled walls and hardwood floors _ was designed for acoustics. Expert opinion on the new hall was not all positive, however. Music critic <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Erikson </PERSON> of the weekly <PERSON> L'Express </PERSON> said he was `` terribly disappointed'' by the hall's acoustics. `` The voices do not project into the room,'' he said. `` The singers were standing at the edge of the stage and yet the sound was completely muffled. This is quite serious.'' The Opera Bastille, which is shaped like an ocean liner, was captainless until May when <PERSON> Myung-Whun </PERSON> <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was named musical director by <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Berge </PERSON>, the financial wizard behind the Yves-Saint Laurent fashion empire. <PERSON> Berge </PERSON> was chosen by <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> to oversee the project in its final days. <PERSON> Chung </PERSON>, a soft-spoken but determined optimist known as a consummate artist, fills the vacancy left in January when <PERSON> Berge </PERSON> fired <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> conductor <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Barenboim </PERSON> for his high fees and elitist ideas about opera. <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> has promised to present the first production in February. The Opera Bastille will close July 20 so the building can be finished. The human rights celebration at the Trocadero was a simple but dramatic reading of the 17 articles of declaration adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Aug. 26, 1789. Punctuating the reading was a group of 48 children singing `` The Song of Joy,'' a hymn composed for the occasion. The choir members, who have been rehearsing since July 1, were from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Togo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. The three American singers were from the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, Boys' Choir `` We wanted to symbolize peace,'' said <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> choir who helped train the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> group. `` The children brought things from their world and shared them with those here today.''

<HEAD>House OKs Fee for Ham Radio Operators</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee voted Thursday to levy licensing fees on ham-radio operators and satellite-launching companies and to increase fees on communications businesses to help reduce the federal budget deficit by $ 50 million. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> also voted to outlaw obscene dial-a-porn messages on interstate and intrastate telephone calls and to restrict access to indecent dial-a-porn messages. It adopted a new fairness doctrine that requires broadcasters to air opposing views on controversial public issues. The committee attached the dial-a-porn and fairness doctrine motions to a budget reconciliation bill. The $ 50 million in increased fees were to help <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> meet the $ 110 billion deficit limit established by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law for fiscal 1990. Under the committee's bill, existing licensing fees charged by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> will go up an average of 12.6 percent. Seventeen communications areas that were exempted will have fees for the first time, ranging from $ 30 for an amateur radio license to $ 70,000 for a permit to launch a satellite, said committee spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>. FCC fines that have not been changed since 1934 also will be increased, <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> said. He said the `` vast majority'' of the $ 50 million will come from new fees, with about a third of the money coming from private radio operations such a rural radio, national paging services, offshore radio and mobile and cellular phones. Minimum fees in nearly all cases will be $ 30, as opposed to $ 5 currently. The $ 70,000 for satellites is the maximum. Other fees include a $ 6,760 fee for a telephone company that requested an <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> hearing. The dial-a-porn provision is in response to a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling last month that invalidated a 1988 law that had outlawed the $ 2 billion dial-a-porn business. The court said indecent speech was protected by the constitution but that obscene speech was not. The court since 1973 has defined obscenity as a work that is patently offensive, purient and has no serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value. <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> said the committee's action `` takes the ruling of the court and works with those constitutional restraints. It bans obsecne speech ... and it regulates indecent speech.'' The bill requires telephone companies to block dial-a-porn calls to their customers' lines unless a customer formally asks to have access to the service. The fairness doctrine was added only after the committee voted 35-8 against an amendment by Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, to strip the provision from the bill. <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON> said the fairness doctrine, a set of guidelines the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> repealed in 1987, was unnecessary, unconstitutional and made the bill `` veto bait'' at the White House. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> committees both passed fairness doctrine bills in April. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has indicated he would veto a fairness doctrine law, and fairness doctrine proponents were not assured of enough votes to override a veto.

<TEXT>
 Tens of thousands of Hungarians on Thursday mourned longtime <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, who died last week more than a year after being eased from power by reformers. `` We came to thank him for what he did for us and the <LOCATION> Hungarian </LOCATION> people,'' said <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Segre </PERSON>, who said he and his wife, <PERSON> Eva </PERSON>, waited more than three hours to view <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>'s red and black shrouded casket lying in state at the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, 77, died on July 6. He is to be buried Friday in a state ceremony attended by <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s new leadership and delegations from the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. On Thursday, mourners, many weeping and carrying flowers, gathered in the late afternoon to pay their respects to <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, who took power as Soviet troops crushed the 1956 anti-Stalinist uprising. In the 32 years before he was ousted by a new generation of reformers in 1988, <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> was conciliatory or ruthless by turns as he searched for consensus in party ranks. But <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> gained respect at home and abroad by the 1970s after launching economic reforms and ushering in a new spirit of tolerance that was in stark contrast to the early years of his rule and many neighboring communist countries. <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>'s legacy of stability and reform efforts appeared to have drawn many to the austere center of communist power in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, bedecked on Thursday with wreaths and floral displays in his memory. `` He gave us peace and a sense of security,'' said <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Segre </PERSON>. `` He got the country going again after 1956 and won international respect for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>.'' `` Comrade <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> was a great man,'' said an elderly woman, who asked not to be identified. She said she waited four hours and `` would have waited longer if I had to.'' The line of those waiting to file through the hushed gallery of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> building stretched more than four city blocks. Hundreds clutched small bouquets of carnations and roses and many carried large wreaths. In May 1988, <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> lost his post as party general secretary. A year later, he was removed as honorary party chairman and stripped of his membership in the policy-setting <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which criticized him for mistakes during his long rule. Although he ushered in economic reforms in the late 1960s and early 1970s, <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> was increasingly blamed for an economic decline after the reforms stalled. Many in the party leadership viewed him as an obstacle to renewal in the country. The Communist Party's re-evaluation of the 1956 uprising as a popular revolt and the rehabilitation of <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>, the prime minister who led it, eroded the legitimacy of <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>'s rule for many. <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> was executed in 1958 and was buried in an unmarked grave. His remains were reburied in an elaborate ceremony June 16 that was attended by hundreds of thousands of Hungarians. Under the leadership of a new generation of reformers, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has embarked on an ambitious program of economic and political reforms designed to move the nation toward a market economy and closer ties to the West.

<HEAD>Nicaragua Elections Will Be Fair: Dodd</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sen. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, D-Conn., said Thursday that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s national elections next year will be fair and free and that its Sandinista government deserves some credit for that from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations subcommittee on <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, also said he expects significant progress in the Latin American peace process at the Aug. 7 meeting of the region's presidents <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> returned early this week from a visit to the region, and told a news conference the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration should be encouraging the process by rewarding the Sandinista government for its progress. The administration, he said, has characterized its policy toward <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as one of `` carrots and sticks,'' rewards when progress is made toward democratic reforms and sanctions when there are reverses. `` At this point, there have been no carrots offered,'' <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said. `` You almost get the sense that the administration is disappointed that the Nicaraguans have made progress in some areas.'' Asked for an example of positive steps taken by the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> cited the provisions made for election observers to be present in the country for a full six months before the balloting and for impromtu political rallies. `` On paper it does n't look bad,'' he said. `` I can see these words come back to haunt me in 10 months. But on paper, it's not bad.'' On another subject, <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> sharply criticized the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for taking no action against Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military ruler, who retained power in May after nullifying the results of presidential elections. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> can not be supportive on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, I do n't think we can get together on anything,'' <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Nurses Strike Puts Hospital Group at One-Fifth Patient Load</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Patients of the state's largest hospital company had to cross picket lines to see their doctors Thursday as 1,300 nurses began striking for higher wages and guaranteed hours. The strike left <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Puget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sound </ORGANIZATION> with a non-union staff capable of handling only one-fifth of the normal patient load at its three hospitals. About 130 patients were moved to other hospitals and 72 remained, said <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Nudelman </PERSON>, the health maintenance organization's executive vice president and chief operating officer. Negotiations broke off shortly after midnight Thursday, and picketing began at 6 a.m. at Group Health hospitals and clinics in five Puget Sound counties that include this city and <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>. Picket lines were up at all Group Health centers except its specialty medical center, which provides urology, oncology, internal medicine and other services, <PERSON> Sosne </PERSON> said. The cooperative also runs 23 family medical centers and four specialty medical centers. All the centers will be open and staffed by physicians and other staff, <PERSON> Nudelman </PERSON> said. Group Health began hiring non-union nurses and preparing to lay off non-nursing staff in preparation for what's expected to be a long strike, <PERSON> Nudelman </PERSON> said. The layoffs were intended to save money. <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosne </PERSON>, president of Local 1199 of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, said the talks broke off because <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> refused to compromise on key issues, particularly staffing decisions. <PERSON> Nudelman </PERSON> said the cooperative's latest offer was still on the table, and that a phone call was all that was needed to reopen talks. `` Our wage and benefit package would make Group Health nurses the best paid in the state of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` It would also give our nurses significant input into decision-making that directly affects their workplace.'' The latest contract offer would boost yearly pay for a first-year nurse to $ 27,706 from $ 23,000, based on a 40-hour work week. A nurse with 15 years' experience would earn about $ 41,000, up from $ 33,000. The nurses were seeking raises of 16 percent in the first year and 14 percent in the second. Management's offer amounts to 23.5 percent over two years. Also at issue in the talks is the company's practice of cutting nurses' hours when there are few patients in the hospital. The nurses are seeking contract provisions to protect their income. The company, a health maintenance organization, has about 370,000 members. An HMO is a type of medical insurance plan that offers members treatment for a fixed monthly payment, rather than reimbursing them on a per-visit basis.

<DATELINE>SILVER CITY, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Biologists on Thursday used long-handled nets to scoop an endangered species of trout from a creek polluted with ash from a nearly beaten wild fire. Firefighters mopped up blazes in five other Western states. The <LOCATION> Gila </LOCATION> trout, lured into a clear section of <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> a day earlier, were collected along a three-quarter mile stretch and put in holding tanks on the sides of mules or horses to be taken eventually to an Apache fish hatchery. `` They are hoping to remove at least 300 of the fish from the creek and more if possible,'' said <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. The creek was becoming choked by ash from a lightning-caused fire in <ORGANIZATION> Gila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> that burned more than 10,000 acres before being contained on Monday. The blaze began June 30 and burned 50 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Silver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The fire should be controlled in two to four days, Ms. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said. Fires in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> were largely contained Thursday. Firefighters mostly mopped up and monitored hot spots. Ash kicked up by the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> blaze had settled in <LOCATION> Diamond </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, choking off oxygen and possibly boosting the water's alkalinity The netted fish were to be transported in 250-gallon aerated tanks aboard two trucks to a hatchery run by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> on the Mescalero Apache Reservation in south-central <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, said Ms. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>. She said the fish are fairly hardy. Gila trout once were widespread in mountain streams in the <LOCATION> Gila </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>. But timber cutting, overgrazing, irrigation and the introduction of rainbow trout have diminished their numbers. The fish has been on the federal endangered species list since 1967. The rescue was undertaken by the state Department of Game and Fish, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, fire bosses took a wait-and-see attitude Thursday on the state's only active wildfire, a 100-acre blaze in an inaccessible area of <LOCATION> Desolation </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION>, 140 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The fire was within a mile of an Uintah and <LOCATION> Ouray </LOCATION> Indian reservation and threatened important deer and elk winter ranges, said <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> district manager <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Nodine </PERSON>. `` If the fire does make a major run, we would have to wait until it reached a more accessible, less hazardous area to actively suppress it,'' he said. Humidity rose significantly in eastern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, helping firefighters subdue a 4,500-acre fire 28 miles from <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Junction </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>. Thirty miles to the northwest, firefighters demobilized after battling a 15,500-acre fire for more than a week In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a fire near the <LOCATION> Ventana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wilderness </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Padres </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> was 70 percent contained. More than 1,500 firefighters were on the firelines at the blaze, which burned 3,087 acres. Three other fires were contained. Five of six fires that have blackened nearly 9,000 acres in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> have been declared contained. The sixth, a 2,000-acre blaze fire in north-central <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Collins </LOCATION>, was 95 percent contained, officials said. In <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>'s northwest corner, the Fort <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> fire, which destroyed 10,000 acres of the 22,000-acre <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Robinson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, was contained with full control expected by Friday, said Fire Chief <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gartner </PERSON>. The blaze destroyed 14 structures and injured nine people, none seriously. <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> firefighters battled a 225-acre fire next to the <LOCATION> Mogollon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION> in east-central <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and expected to contain it on Saturday. Every other major fire in the state was declared contained Wednesday. Some 3,000 acres burned.

He said the takeover will occur July 29, the deadline President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> set for the pullout of 40,000 Indian troops deployed in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> is refusing to withdraw them. A moderate Tamil leader who supported the deployment of Indian soldiers in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> and a party colleague were killed in a <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> home Thursday, officials said. In his comments Thursday, <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> would stick to the pullout deadline. `` Sri Lankan army and police will come out of their barracks to maintain law and order in the north and east, because after July 29 the Indian troops will be treated as an occupational army,'' <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> said. On Wednesday, Indian Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> said a pullout of the troops could only be decided through negotiations and had to be accompanied by increasing powers for the Tamil government in the Northeastern Province. The message was tantamount to refusing to withdraw the troops by <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s deadline. In a reply Thursday, <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> said military action by the Indian armed forces was `` unnecessary and prejudicial to a settlement by discussion and negotiation.'' He said his government was willing to hold talks on the issue but the pullout and political issue were `` totally unconnected.'' Indian soldiers were deployed in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s Tamil-dominated north and east on July 29, 1987, under an agreement between the two countries. The Indian-mediated accord was aimed at ending a rebellion by Tamil insurgents. The rebels were to give up their weapons in exchange for limited autonomy in regions where they dominated and Indian soldiers were to ensure peace. But the peace plan fell apart after the largest rebel group, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, backed out and began fighting the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>. Smaller Tamil groups surrendered and were voted to power in the province's local elections last year but now accuse the government of not giving them enough power. The moderate Tamil leader who was killed was identified by an <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official as <PERSON> Appapillai </PERSON> <PERSON> Amirthalingam </PERSON>, the 62-year-old leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said another party member was also killed and three people were injured. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> news agency said <PERSON> Amirthalingam </PERSON> and his colleague were killed by three gunmen belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>. The three gunmen were later shot and killed by <PERSON> Amirthalingam </PERSON>'s bodyguards, the news agency said. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> exchanged sharply worded letters after <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> asked <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> on June 1 to pull out its soldiers by the second anniversary of the agreement. The request followed talks in May between his government and the <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION>, the first direct contact between the two sides since the insurgency began in 1983. Under the 1987 agreement, Indian soldiers took over law and order in the north and east and <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lankan </LOCATION> troops were confined to their barracks. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> became involved in the troubles of the island nation off its southern coast because of the sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils for the rebel cause. Sri Lankan Tamils launched a war for a separate nation complaining of discrimination by the majority Sinhalese community. The predominantly Hindu Tamils comprise 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people, and the <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION> make up 75 percent Also Thursday, officials announced that more than 40,000 public transport workers ended a crippling monthlong strike after reaching a wage agreement with the government. Bus drivers, clerks and mechanics of the state-owned transport company walked off their jobs on June 12, demanding higher wages. But the government said the strike was sponsored by Sinhalese militants using the wage issue to fuel civil unrest. The militants say the government has been too soft on the Tamils. Transport Minister <PERSON> Wijepala </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendis </PERSON> said in a statement that the government would increase workers' monthly salaries by $ 5.60 and give monthly back pay of $ 1.50 retroactive to January 1982.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> backed away from a threat to leave the government after the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and American Jews asked it Thursday not to upset Israeli peace proposals. An aide to Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had indirect contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> through <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intermediaries. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, who leads the party, said <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> `` has no aspiration to break up the government. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> aims to work for the advancement of the peace plan. Now the campaign is on continuing the peace initiative.'' In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, a tear gas grenade exploded Thursday night during the closing ceremony of the international Maccabiah Games for Jewish athletes. Thousands of people, including Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamire </PERSON>, attended the ceremony at the Western Wall in <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, holiest site of Judaism. The cloud of acrid smoke set hundreds of people running. Several were treated for smoke inhalation. Police spokesman <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandouri </PERSON> said the grenade could have been thrown by Arab nationalists or accidentally dropped by a police officer. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> army radio said several suspects were detained, but did not elaborate. <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> police chief <PERSON> Aryeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Bibi </PERSON> said later the grenade was not of the type used by police and was not dropped by a policemen. In the occupied territories, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers killed a Palestinian on Wednesday night when masked youths attacked an army patrol in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> with knives and axes, the army said. The death raised to 560 the number of Palestinians killed in the 19-month uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. Thirty-five Israelis have been slain. Eight Arabs were reported wounded Thursday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and urged the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to follow a moderate line, the Foreign Office reported. It said the meeting was the first between a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> officer and a senior <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s deputy foreign minister, <PERSON> Benyamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON>, called the meeting was `` a setback not only for genuine peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, but ... for British policy against terrorism.'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> spoke after Labor ministers met Wednesday night and decided to stay in the governing coalition if <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> reaffirms his commitment to the peace initiative. <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders recommended Monday the party quit the Cabinet to protest hard-line conditions for peace talks with the Palestinians. The conditions, including an end to the uprising before peace talks are held, were adopted by <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc July 5. Labor leaders did not cancel a party vote on the issue set for next month, but many ministers said a compromise was possible. The Labor move followed appeals from Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> Jewish leaders for Labor to stay in the government. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> denied it sought to intervene, but <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials confirmed the appeals. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Thursday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not change its <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> policy. He said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should go forward with elections in which the 1.7 million Palestinians of the occupied lands would elect representatives to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Leading voices within <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> said they wanted Labor to stay and the peace plan remained intact. <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> said: `` If they want to leave, it's their business,'' but added: `` I do n't think it would be proper at this moment.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> said the prime minister met with <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leaders from the occupied lands about the election plan, and some observers said the meetings were timed to pacify Labor. `` There have been, there are and there will be meetings with Palestinians from the territories ... but there were no meetings with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> people or those linked or close to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> said. Israeli radio reported that <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Rahman </PERSON> said his organization has had direct contacts with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials, including a discussion with a messenger of Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, and that <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was aware of it. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, as well as the Foreign and Justice ministries, denied direct or indirect contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s office director, <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Aharon </PERSON>, dismissed such reports by describing the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as `` the embodiment of cheating, lies and obscenity.'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> deputy <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Beilin </PERSON> said, however, that indirect but `` clear, official, unequivocal negotiations have been under way ... via the Americans'' for more than two months. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television said <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> routinely briefs <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> on the U.S.-PLO talks in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is briefed on Israeli positions.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday approved an overhaul of the immigration system that would limit new arrivals to 630,000 in each of the next three years and expand the number coming from <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` This bill not only carries forward and increases the present emphasis on family reunification, it also opens opportunities for new immigrants with new skills,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., one of the bill's sponsors The bill, approved 81-17 after two days of debate, now goes to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. It was originally designed to cap immigration at 600,000 in each of the next three years but was expanded by 30,000 visas before final passage. The ceiling represents 136,000 more visas than were issued in 1988, but but critics say the bill still could reduce visas for all but the closest relatives of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens and permanent residents of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved a similar bill in 1988 but it died in the House. The measure now goes to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and the measure's co-sponsor, Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., saying they are optimistic about the prospects this Lawmakers voted 78-21 to expand the cap by 30,000 visas a year following an emotional appeal from Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., who recalled how his father fled `` the boot of the czar'' in 1911 and arrived in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` with no rubles in his pocket He had to come steerage.'' `` There is nothing magic to me about the number 600,000,'' <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> said. But senators fought back 52-46 a move by Sen. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON>, R-Minn., to expand by 40,000 the number of brothers and sisters of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens that would be allowed into the country annually `` My heart is on the side of what Sen. <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON> is doing,'' Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., said But he added that `` there is a saturation point with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public and I want to be prudent as we move ahead.'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said it was `` time to face the unfortunate but hideously cold reality that there are many more people who want to come here than there is room or intent to accommodate them.'' Following intense floor skirmishing, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> did approve an amendment from Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON>, D-Ala., that would force the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> to halt its practice of including illegal aliens in its official count Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, said that under the current system `` states like <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> would gain a -LRB- congressional -RRB- seat at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s expense'' because their populations are swollen with illegal aliens. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> called the amendment `` flatly unconstitutional,'' but lawmakers refused 58-41 to kill it and eventually adopted it on a voice vote. The legislation would reserve 120,000 visas annually for those entering on a basis other than family ties. That category includes 54,000 visas subject to a point system giving credit for those with special skills needed by American industry but who do not have employers ready to sponsor them. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted 12-2 to delete the provision that would provide extra points to individuals who speak English. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in vain to restore the point system but lawmakers rejected the idea, 56-43. `` English is the language of success,'' he declared. He said those who are unable to understand English will have a tough time obtaining jobs and urged lawmakers not to be swayed by sentimental portrayals as immigrants as the heart and soul of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream. `` The heart and soul disappears when you ca n't get work,'' he said. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, however, quoted a news clipping that said 13 of the 16 valedictorians in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s publish high schools this year were born in foreign countries and the majority apparently did not have English for a mother tongue. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> expressed frustration that the sentiment-tinged debate appeared to be going against him. `` You have snorted and ripped and rolled around in it and you have just given birth to a mouse,'' he declared. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved, 358-44, and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> separate legislation to ease immigration of certain Soviet and Southeast Asian refugees. It would temporarily re-establish the legal status of Soviet Jews and evangelican Christians as well as certain categories of Vietnamese, Laotians and Cambodians as persecuted, without individuals having to prove it in their own cases. That would aid them in obtaining standing as refugees. The measure is opposed by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, which contends it unnecessarily establishes special preferences for certain refugees and makes it more difficult to administer the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> refugee program fairly. Those voting against the measure were Sens. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON>, D-Ark.; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif.; <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Neb., <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Ky.; <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, D-Tenn.; <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, D-Ala.; <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>,; <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, D-Nev.; <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supplied the key to help unlock the biggest birthday party in French history Thursday as swanky dinners and the opera took center stage after the president's four-day trip to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and more than 30 other world leaders were treated to a swirl of festivities celebrating the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution. The events ranged from a solemn ceremony commemorating the drafting of the French version of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Declaration of Independence to an offbeat parade capping the celebration Friday that will feature Russians dancing with a bear on ice, Britons marching under artificial rain and a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> band moonwalking up the famed Champs Elysee. To guard against terrorist attacks, 30,000 police were deployed around the city with rooftop marksmen and even ground-to-air missiles added to the security dragnet. Amid the hoopla of the birthday bash, more weighty issues were being discussed as well. The president's other reason for being in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> was to attend his first economic summit of the leaders of the world's seven richest nations. The 15th annual economic conference among the leaders of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> was to feature for the first time a major emphasis on ways to clean up the global environment. With his historic trip to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> still very much on his mind, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> indicated he would be urging the other summit leaders to step forward with assistance packages of their own to further economic and political reform behind the Iron Curtain. Speaking to reporters on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One on the flight from <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he believed his four-day trip had `` given encouragement to those who want to go the path of reform, political change, economic change.'' His national security adviser, <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, said the president would encourage his summit partners to create a `` clearinghouse'' to avoid duplication of the assistance packages offered by the rich nations. On the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would not relax its policy of opposing Israeli settlements in the occupied territories in order to accommodate political turmoil in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, a country <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> conceded is best by `` great difficulties.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was greeted by French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, with whom he later met, at the inaugural bicentennial event, a reading of the Declaration of the Rights of Man, the document that proclaimed in October 1789 the French Revolution's aims of liberty, equality and fraternity for all. At the end of the ceremony at the historic <LOCATION> Place </LOCATION> <LOCATION> du </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Trocadero </LOCATION>, children threw peace laurels, flowers and children's toys on a stone inscribed with the declaration while 500 doves were released into a cloudless sky. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also participated in a ceremony in which the key to the Bastille prison was turned over to <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>. The Bastille was the central <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> prison stormed by the populace on July 14, 1789, setting off the revolution. The key to the fortress had been presented 199 years ago to President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> by the <PERSON> Marquis </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Fayette </PERSON>, who had served as a general under <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> during the American Revolution. The key ceremony represented a brief loan with the artifact headed back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s home in northern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> after the bicentennial is over. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the other world leaders attended the inaugural concert of the Opera Bastille Thursday night where they descended a dramatic gray stone staircase leading to the modern glass-and-steel opera house. <PERSON> Mitterand </PERSON>, who considers himself a champion of the rights of the poor, invited several leaders of poor Third World countries to partake in the festivities, hoping to formulate a dialogue between the haves and have-nots. Leaders from both the rich and poor nations dined together Thursday night on an opulent meal of lobster with artichokes, lamb, Roquefort cheese with figs and nuts and, for dessert, almond ice cream with apricot sauce. They washed it all down with four different wines. The leaders of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> issued a call to <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> to help organize a North-South summit between developed and developing nations and the French president endorsed the idea. East-West relations and developments in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> presidential spokesman <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vedrine </PERSON>, figured prominently in <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s 40-minute discussions with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` The two men are on the same wavelength,'' <PERSON> Vedrine </PERSON> told reporters. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> agreed the economic and democratic reforms in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` offer a whole new perspective for the first time in 40 years.'' msc

 Illinois Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, the longest-serving incumbent governor in the nation, said Thursday he will not seek a fifth term in 1990. The announcement set off a political scramble for the governor's seat But the 53-year-old Republican, who was mentioned early in his political career as a presidential contender, said he hoped his legacy would go far beyond the coming battle to succeed him. `` I believe with all my heart that in most ways this is a better state, with a better chance for the future, than when I entered the governorship in January of 1977,'' said <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, who was near tears during a 30-minute news conference at the State of <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, flanked by his wife, <PERSON> Jayne </PERSON>, and their 10-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Samantha </PERSON>, said he chose to leave public life because he needed to provide for his family and sought the challenge of returning to the private sector as a lawyer or businessman. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> declined to rule out running for another office, and said he could have won another term as governor. `` My wife and daughter have told me they are willing to support a campaign for re-election, but I am not willing at this time to ask them to do that,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. `` My family and their happiness and security are more important to me than anything else in the world.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, who spent a month earlier this year at the <ORGANIZATION> Betty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> undergoing treatment for alcoholism, said she supported the decision and acknowledged that public life extracted a toll from the family. `` I think it's sometimes difficult to live your life in the public eye,'' she said. Jockeying for position has already begun among possible candidates for next year's primary race for governor. At least three Democrats and as many Republicans are considered possible candidates, with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> among top likely contenders. Though titular leader of the state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> and a backer of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the moderate <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> has frequently been at odds with fellow Republicans on fiscal and social issues. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> was mentioned as a possible presidential candidate after his 1976 and 1978 victories made him one of the few Republicans to buck the post-Watergate wave that swamped many GOP colleagues. He first burst into the national spotlight during a four-year tenure as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney from 1971-75, when he sent several prominent allies of the late Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> to prison on corruption charges. Passing up an offer to run against <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> instead claimed the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> gubernatorial nomination in 1976 and defeated Daley-backed Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Howlett </PERSON> by a record 1.39 million votes. He bested former Democratic <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Adlai </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> in his last two campaigns _ in 1982 by the narrowest margin in state history, and again in 1986 to become the only four-term governor in state history. The son of a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> physician, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> once autographed a high-school yearbook, `` Vote for me for president.'' But he spent much of his early career in law _ as a <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor, a <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law professor and an assistant state attorney general.

 A baby died Thursday after being shot by her 6-year-old sister hours after Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> signed a bill to protect children from accidental shootings in the home. Nine-month-old <PERSON> Enereida </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> was the fourth <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> child killed this summer in an accidental shooting. She was shot late Wednesday after her sister, <PERSON> Llasmin </PERSON>, found a .38 - caliber revolver lying under a towel on their parents' bed, police <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> was horrified by the news, said his press secretary, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>. `` It just underscores the whole problem, when a child is shot just hours after he signs a bill to stop these things from happening,'' <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> said. Although the law signed by <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> does n't take effect until Oct. 1, <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> authorities could bring charges under existing laws. `` We will gather all the information and turn it over to the state attorney's office for review under the culpable negligence statute,'' said police spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>. Under the new law, no grieving parent of an injured or fatally wounded child shot by another member of the family could be arrested until seven days after the incident. The law provides for adults to be charged with a felony, punishable by up to five years in prison and a $ 5,000 fine, if a child shoots himself or another because of the owner's carelessness. If a minor threatens someone with the gun or displays it in public, the gun owner faces a misdemeanor charge and up to 60 days in jail and a $ 500 fine. The law requires gun owners to prevent loaded weapons kept in homes and businesses from falling into the hands of children 15 and younger by using such precautions as trigger locks or keeping a weapon in a locked box. Three children died in early June in similar household shootings, inspiring lawmakers to push for the legislation during a special session intended to deal with other issues last month.

<HEAD>Guards Kill 10 Who Tried to Kill Leftist Councilman</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Gunmen stormed a leftist city councilman's house in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> and tried to assassinate him Thursday, but his bodyguards killed 10 of the attackers, including two police officers, the national police said. Elsewhere, leftist guerrillas kidnapped a federal congressman and blew up the country's biggest oil pipeline for the 25th time this year. The 10 slain attackers had tried to kill councilman <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Henao </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, where drug traffickers have been financing right-wing death squads to exterminate members of a leftist party. <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> is the leader in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, organized six years ago with the support of leftist guerrillas. Right-wing death squads have killed 729 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> in the last four years. <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> was attacked twice, first while he was in his car shortly before midnight Wednesday, police Col. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> said at a news conference in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>'s guards held off the attackers while the councilman and other guards got away, <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> said. Then, shortly after midnight, gunmen stormed the councilman's house, and his guards killed 10 attackers, <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> said `` Unfortunately, among the dead attackers we found two policemen who had broken their vows to serve society,'' <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, a city of 2 million people in northwest <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, is the the headquarters for <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s biggest drug traffickers. The traffickers began killing leftists after guerrillas kidnapped and held for ransom members of some of the traffickers' families. Traffickers and guerrillas also are at war because the guerrillas demand that the drug traffickers pay for having their cocaine-processing laboratories in rebel controlled areas. The congressman kidnapped by guerrillas was <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Campo </PERSON> <PERSON> Soto </PERSON>, according to the national police in the northwest state of <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>. He was kidnapped Thursday in Cesar state near his ranch, the police said. Police blamed the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which has abducted 54 persons this year, including congressmen, mayors, city councilmen, policemen and news reporters. The police quoted <PERSON> Campo </PERSON>'s family as saying that the guerrillas told them that <PERSON> Campo </PERSON> would be released soon. Most of the people who have been kidnapped by the guerrillas, of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, have been released after being lectured on the guerrillas' political objectives. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> also blew up the country's main oil pipeline Thursday for the 25th time this year, the national police said. The attack again forced suspension of the pumping of 220,000 barrels of oil a day from the big <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limon </ORGANIZATION> field in northeast <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s oil production has plunged to 312,000 barrels a day from 420,000 barrels a day in January because of the guerrilla attacks, the state oil company <ORGANIZATION> Ecopetrol </ORGANIZATION> said last week. The pipeline runs 500 miles from the <LOCATION> Cano </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Limon </LOCATION> field to the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Covenas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cano </PERSON> <PERSON> Limon </PERSON> is operated jointly by <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ecopetrol </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> wants foreign oil companies out of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. In another development, the national police said antinarcotics police arrested a captain and two lieutenants of the national police on suspicion of drug trafficking. The three police officers were arrested Wednesday as they landed in a helicopter in the southwest state of <LOCATION> Valle </LOCATION>, the police said. The police had $ 259,000 in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency with them, the police said. The chief of the national police, Gen. <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON>, began raids on drug laboratories two hours after taking over in January from a general who was fired by President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> for allegedly trafficking in cocaine. <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> has fired more than 1,000 policemen for their associations with known drug traffickers or other criminals.

<TEXT>
 Senators from the South and upper <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> pressed Thursday to get aid for weather-damaged crops in their states included in drought-relief legislation lawmakers are rushing to finish this summer. `` We've got a comprehensive problem that's going to take a comprehensive approach,'' Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.D. </LOCATION>, told fellow members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` The loss is great ... and the time is short.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> have been backing off their insistence that drought relief be limited to winter wheat farmers. However, it is uncertain whether enough money would be available to cover losses of other crops. Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> had said he would recommend President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> veto a drought relief package approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> that would cover more than 500 crops and cost more than $ 900 million. However, recent flooding has severely damaged crops such as cotton across the South, and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinner </PERSON> this week declared his entire state a disaster area because of hot, dry weather. Soybean and cotton crops are rated fair to poor in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> primarily because of heavy rains. Crops also have been hurt in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, nine southern senators said in a letter Thursday to <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>. Parts of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> have received up to 60 inches of rain, said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>. The committee is scheduled to vote on a drought-relief bill next week that lawmakers hope to get approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> before the August recess. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> could be authorized to provide aid to other crops where farmers can demonstrate weather-related losses. However, he argued that the legislation should first take care of winter wheat farmers, who already have lost much of their crop. `` What we need to figure out in this committee, hopefully on a bipartisan basis, is how we're going to deal with areas that have a demonstrated loss and how we're going to find the money,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. Winter wheat farmers deserve first crack at drought relief because most of the money the government is saving in the farm program this year is because of the lower wheat production, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimated the government would save $ 950 million in farm program payments to winter wheat growers because wheat prices are high. The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> has said overall savings to the farm program from wheat and other crops this year could run as high as $ 1.5 billion.

<TEXT>
 The B-2 stealth bomber sped down a runway Thursday, successfully completing its final ground test and setting the stage for a first flight that could come as early as Saturday, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> general said. The sleek, bat-winged bomber raced down the runway at <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> 42, achieving a top speed of 75 mph, said Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Scofield </PERSON>, director of the B-2 program. Although <PERSON> Scofield </PERSON> said the bomber's long-delayed first flight could come Saturday, he cautioned that the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> is being prudent and will not be rushed despite political controversy harrying the bomber's progress toward full production. `` The plane will fly when it is ready,'' he said. However, <PERSON> Scofield </PERSON> said that B-2 builder <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials believe they have all the data they need to send the bomber airborne. The radar-evading bomber was tested in high winds that kicked up clouds of dust on the 11,000-foot runway at the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s prime research and development plant in the <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION>. During the test, the bomber's nose wheel lifted up into the air, a procedure that was anticipated, <PERSON> Scofield </PERSON> said. `` It was not an aborted takeoff,'' he said. The bomber rolled to the end of the runway and one of its tires became stuck in soft asphalt, making it necessary to tow it back to its hangar. However, <PERSON> Scofield </PERSON> said everything went perfectly in conducting the test as far as the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> was concerned. No first flight is anticipated Friday because the crew and the pilots needed rest, the general said. The flying wing was decked out with orange highlights that were used to cover sensors and test equipment. On Monday, the gray bomber built from composite materials rather than metal conducted slow-speed tests on the ground, achieving a speed of approximately 102 mph. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> pleaded with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> not to `` nickel and dime to death'' the B-2, saying the stealth bomber is essential for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> capability to `` penetrate improving Soviet air defenses.'' Testifying before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> urged lawmakers to try to overcome `` sticker shock'' at the $ 500 million to $ 750 million price for each plane and to restore some $ 800 million the panel cut from the B-2 budget last month. Lawmakers warned <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials earlier this week that the B-2 faces a tough uphill fight in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> despite the warplane's strategic importance `` Put it in perspective or there's a real possibility that the B-2 will become a museum piece,'' Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials at the start of a hearing The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> campaign comes amid growing opposition to the bomber, which recent estimates indicate would be the most expensive aircraft in history. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> announced last week the first flight tests of the bomber, which are 18 months behind schedule, would be held during the next two weeks. The Pentagon is proposing a $ 4.7 billion budget in fiscal 1990 for the B-2. The plane will cost about $ 24 billion over a three-year peak period beginning in fiscal 1992, according to <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> figures. The department has invested about $ 22.4 billion in the plane so far.

<HEAD>House Wants to End Tongass Forest Timber Deals</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Changes references to ``lumber'' to timber throughout.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved environmentalist-backed legislation Thursday that would cancel 50-year deals under which two timber companies have been harvesting trees from <ORGANIZATION> Tongass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> at bargain basement prices. The legislation, which passed 356-60, also establishes more wilderness areas in the forest in southeastern <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and creates buffer zones around many streams and tributaries to protect fish from logging operations. The timber contracts have been a `` raid on the taxpayers,'' said Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., who led debate in favor of the bill `` We say get your hands out of our pockets.'' `` The timber companies keep the bureaucrats employed and the bureaucrats keep the timber companies wallowing in federal subsidies,'' said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. `` I'm terribly disappointed,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, who led the fight against the bill in the name of jobs for his state's residents `` It goes to show the influence of the environmentalist point of view.'' The legislation is directed at <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Pacific-Ketchikan and <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pulp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a Japanese firm, and <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said 6,000 jobs could be lost if the companies go out of business. Proponents of the bill, however, said it throws the door open to competition from independent timber companies, owned by Alaskans, which could create more jobs for the state population. `` If we cancel these contracts, it does n't drive the timber industry out of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mrazek </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, co-sponsor of the bill. `` It simply puts these companies on same footing as other companies.'' Young, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> and many members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, including <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Kika </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, favored a version of the bill that would have called for renegotiation rather than cancellation of the timber contracts. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> oversees the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which is part of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. But that version, offered as an amendment, failed on a 269-144 vote. The bill now goes to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said he expected an outcome more to his liking. If the legislation is not changed, it will be vetoed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> has said he would recommend a veto of legislation that called for termination of the contracts. The House bill eliminates the $ 40 million that now goes annually for such activities as road-building to aid the timber companies in Tongass and requires an amount to be set each year in the federal budget. Proponents said that could save the government $ 205 million over the next five years. It also would end the requirement that the government make 4.5 billion board feet of the forest's timber available each decade. The bill would designate 23 areas as wilderness, barring timber harvesting and development on 1.8 million acres. The legislation also would ban logging within 100 feet of salmon streams. In an effort to establish a stable economy in southeast <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1947 authorized the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to later sign the unprecedented 50-year contracts with timber companies. The contracts with the two firms expire in 2004 and 2011. The forest is the size of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> combined and stretches over most of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s 500-mile long panhandle. It's one of the few remaining temperate rain forests, with an annual precipitation of averaging 150 inches. It and the Olympic National Park in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> are the last remnants of a rain forest that used to stretch from northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>.

 A tanker carrying desperately needed fuel for <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s besieged Christians broke through a Syrian blockade Thursday, sparking heavy artillery battles in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Police reported three people killed and 10 wounded in shelling duels that raged from late Wednesday night through Thursday afternoon, further undermining cease-fire efforts by Arab League envoys. Thursday's casualties raised the toll to 409 killed and 1,614 wounded since fighting erupted March 8. Christian army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> hinted he might use surface-to-surface missiles against <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> if it keeps the blockade in place, the <ORGANIZATION> Mideast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> newsletter reported Thursday. Tension has risen over the reported delivery of Soviet-designed Frog-7 missiles to <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s troops by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The missiles have a range of 43 miles, enough to hit the Syrian capital of <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> if fired from the eastern edge of the Christian enclave. The Christians have never had that capability in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war The London-based weekly quoted <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> saying that `` as far as the blockade is concerned ... there is so much one can take before an explosion occurs. `` I'm not for a Frogs war with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, but patience has its limits,'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> was quoted as saying in the telephone interview. The Syrians, alarmed at the reports of the missiles, last week tightened their naval blockade. However, police said the tanker that broke the blockade docked at the port of <LOCATION> Byblos </LOCATION>, 19 miles north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, at noon and began unloading its cargo, triggering a fierce Syrian bombardment. Christian army gunners retaliated, firing 155mm howitzers at Syrian batteries along the seaside <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Mreisseh </PERSON> boulevard in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, a police spokesman said on condition of anonymity. He declined to name the tanker or say how much fuel it carried for the 1 million Christians trapped in their 310-square-mile enclave for 16 weeks. The Syrians have been trying to stop fuel, food and arms from reaching the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> forces led by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who also leads the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> half of this country's dual government. It was not clear how the tanker dodged Syrian gunboats patrolling off the Christian coast. They have turned back several ships trying to run the blockade this week. Several others have been sunk by Syrian shellfire. Three shells hit the campus of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION>, which overlooks <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Mreisseh </PERSON>, during the night. Classes have been suspended, and there were no casualties. But customers at Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>'s restaurant across the street were blown off their chairs. `` The whole place turned orange with the blast,'' said photographic technician <PERSON> Janine </PERSON> <PERSON> Haidar </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Moslem sector also was rocked overnight Wednesday by gunbattles between rival <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> militiamen who traded hit-and-run grenade assaults on each other's strongholds behind mortar barrages. No casualties were reported from the fighting that raged in the southern slums between the Syrian-backed Amal militia and pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. The hostilities ebbed into sporadic sniping at daybreak as Syrian troops in charge of west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s security sought to enforce a cease-fire, the police spokesman said. Eighteen people have been killed and 51 wounded in two weeks of sporadic street battles. The secular Amal and fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> have been vying since April 1988 to control <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 1.2 million Shiites, the country's largest sect. The fighting flared after several months of relative calm. The artillery duels between the Syrian and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> forces smothered the festive mood of Moslems marking the first day of Eid al-Adha, or the Feast of Sacrifice, which is Islam's holiest.

<HEAD>Busboy Finds FBI Camera in Restaurant Favored by Politicians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A busboy who found a video camera and wire hidden in a booth at an eatery near City Hall has blown the cover on an apparent federal corruption probe, the restaurant's lawyer said Thursday. Owners of Counselors Row Restaurant, a spot popular with lawmakers and others with clout, were `` shocked, outraged and extremely upset that this type of conduct exists in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said restaurant attorney <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spina </PERSON>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> planted the listening devices, and they were discovered by one of our busboys,'' <PERSON> Spina </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> also tapped a telephone on a pedestal next to a table often used by influential politicians, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> reported, quoting unidentified sources. The sophisticated, wide-angle camera with a small lens was found Friday hidden in the base of a booth, <PERSON> Spina </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> declined to comment on whether the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was involved, as did <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON>. The federal prosecutor added that `` Counselors Row is not the target of any investigation.'' Restaurant co-owner <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Borovilos </PERSON> said that after he talked to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday, agents came to the establishment and removed the camera. They left behind a connecting wire that ran under a seat cushion, through a concrete wall and down into the basement of the building, <PERSON> Borovilos </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Spina </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, the federal prosecutor in charge of organized crime investigations in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, confirmed that he had authorized planting the device. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> has refused to comment on the case. A judge approved the installation of the surveillance equipment and it was placed in the restaurant without the owners' consent, apparently on a weekend when the place was closed, <PERSON> Spina </PERSON> said. `` We are awaiting word from <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON>' office to see if they'll agree to make the sealed court order a public one,'' Spina said Thursday <PERSON> Spina </PERSON> said the camera was pointed at a table often used by <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Roti </PERSON> and Democratic ward Committeeman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Arco </PERSON>, among other local politicians. <PERSON> Roti </PERSON> said in a news release, `` There is no reason for me to be investigated, and no reason to believe that I am being investigated.'' He added in an interview broadcast by <ORGANIZATION> WGN-TV </ORGANIZATION> Thursday, `` I do n't like it I'm sure a lot of other people do n't like it. But whether we like it or not, they have court jurisdiction and the right to do it, so being angry is meaningless to me.'' The telephone rang unanswered at <PERSON> D'Arco </PERSON>'s office Thursday. <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> WGN </ORGANIZATION>, `` It's an open restaurant. It's an open table When we leave at 9 o'clock, God knows who sits here.'' <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mell </PERSON>, who also frequents the table or ones nearby, said, `` I have no problem with -LRB- the bugs -RRB-. Is it true? It looks like a very interesting story.''

 A war hero who fought with <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s revolution was executed by firing squad at dawn Thursday with three other officers for smuggling tons of drugs into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the official Cuban news agency said. The drug scandal has stunned and embarrassed <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> and his communist government, which for years denied <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> accusations that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> was being used to smuggle cocaine and marijuana to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In a brief dispatch monitored in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latina </ORGANIZATION> said the sentences against Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Arnaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, Col. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Font </ORGANIZATION>, Maj. <PERSON> Amado </PERSON> <PERSON> Padron </PERSON> and Capt. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> had been carried out. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> was a trusted aide to President <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, commanding <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and heading a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> military mission to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The news agency noted that the four men, along with 10 other officers, were convicted by a summary court-martial and that the deliberations on their appeal were broadcast to the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> nation. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, who long rejected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug smuggling accusations as a plot to defame <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, said Sunday the scandal had done immense internal damage and eroded <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s international image. He called the sentences a `` bitter decision,'' but added that he also thought about `` others who have died.'' `` I think of those who fell to build a decent society ... to create a republic where justice ruled, where there was no corruption, dishonesty, fraud or treason,'' <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> before it voted to affirm the death sentences. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Thursday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is n't convinced <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> is serious about combating drug trafficking, despite the executions. Deputy <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said the administration has had information linking <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to narcotics smuggling since 1982 and has expressed its concerns since then. He reacted coolly to a suggestion by <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> join to wage this `` common battle'' against drugs. `` You do n't automatically start negotiating cooperation until you have an indication the other side is really serious. And that's what we're looking for,'' <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said, asserting that drug smuggling through <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> continues. The investigation, court-martial and appeal were given unprecedented publicity aimed at showing they had a fair trial and at erasing a stain on the honor of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Ordinary life virtually came to a halt during televised proceedings that began June 12. Cubans gathered around their sets in fascination not just at the drug scandal but also because of the scenario of unbridled greed that unfolded. The trial indicated that <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> helped smuggle tons of cocaine and marijuana into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in alliance with <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, the world's largest drug trafficking organization The officers were also convicted of black marketeering and smuggling diamonds, ivory, sugar, fine woods, manufactured goods and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars. All confessed guilt but asked for mercy based on their records and contrition. Ten of the officers, including one woman, were sentenced to terms that ranged from 10 to 30 years in prison. In a statement before a military court of honor that stripped the accused of military ranks and decorations, <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> said he deserved to die for betraying <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> and the revolution. Defense Minister <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON>'s brother, told an earlier court of honor that <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> had been `` spreading around gifts and handing out objects of value, mainly to officers ... in a delirious exercise of self-indulgence, for the creation of an image and links of gratitude to his person.'' That seemed to imply that <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> was trying to bring others into his ring. There was speculation that <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> was either trying to avoid being turned in or even building his own power base, perhaps to challenge or gain some measure of independence from the <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> brothers, who have ruled <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> since 1959. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, 57, fought in the guerrilla war that brought <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> to power and was made a Hero of the Revolution, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s highest honor, for heading the <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s 50,000-man expedition in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and an earlier one to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. In his summation to the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, made up of top government and party officials and constituting <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s final court of appeal, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> tried to distance himself from <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, citing mistakes he made in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> that led to battlefield defeats. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> had concentrated on his illicit activities and risked defeat by South African forces aiding Angolan rebels. He said people must wonder how an officer `` so out of control'' could have been given such responsibility. In addition to the officers on trial, the transportation and interior ministers have been sacked for failing to detect and halt the ring, according to <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> media reports. Unconfirmed reports said other officials were arrested. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said commuting <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>'s sentence could create an impression that high-ranking officials could get away with anything. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> and his cohorts `` must have felt like the most untouchable people in the world,'' <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Coast Guard Test Shows No Oil Present In Slick From Valdez</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Preliminary tests showed no oil in a slick from the Exxon Valdez, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday, but the damaged tanker will remain outside <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> while more tests are conducted. The tests conducted by a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> laboratory conflict with the preliminary conclusion of the state Fish and Game Department's lab. State officials said traces of petroleum were discovered in samples taken from the 18-mile-long slick that developed when the <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> arrived off <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> on Monday. The Coast Guard test also used a sample from that slick. `` The results indicate no presence of oil,'' Coast Guard Cmdr. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Scarborough </PERSON> said. `` They indicate the presence of some unidentified organic matter.'' A team of federal and state scientists, coordinated by a specialist from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, has been assembled to analyze fresh samples from subsequent <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> discharges. `` There are questions that have been raised relative to the sampling procedures used by both laboratories,'' said <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Bontadelli </PERSON>, director of the state Fish and Game Department. `` That is the reason we are establishing a single, coordinated team so we can resolve the question once -LRB- and -RRB- for all.'' The Valdez was towed 2,500 miles to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, where it was responsible for the nation's worst oil spill. The vessel was damaged March 24, when it struck a reef in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, spewing nearly 11 million gallons of oil. Coast Guard officials have barred the Valdez from entering <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> for repairs until they are sure it poses no environmental or navigational threat. The ship remained about 50 miles off <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> on Thursday. `` We're quite comfortable with where it is and until everyone understands what the analysis tells us. We are in no hurry to move,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Iarossi </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> president. Before the Valdez can enter the harbor, five steel slabs that peeled away from its hull during the trip from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> must be removed so it can navigate the shallow harbor channel. For the safety of the divers, the salvage work must be performed in a sheltered cove or inlet, but officials do n't want to move the ship until they determine what's being discharged.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Hook </PERSON>, a philosopher, author and educator who had been a leading figure in American intellectual circles since the late 1920s, died of congestive heart failure at the age of 86. Hook died Wednesday at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. Since 1973, he had been a senior research fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> Hoover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> on War, Revolution and Peace on the <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> campus. He took the position after retiring from <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where he had taught since 1927 and had been chairman of the philosophy department until 1968. Hook became a leading proponent of philosopher <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON>'s ideals, known as pragmatism, a peculiarly American philosphy that an idea must be judged by how it works rather than by how it looks Under the philosophy, an idea may be true under certain circumstances but false under others. Hook first became known as a secular humanist. His first book, `` The Metaphysics of Pragmatism,'' published in 1927, was an exposition of <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON>'s thought. Hook became an international figure in 1933 upon publication of `` Towards the Understanding of <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>,'' which was viewed as a sympathetic interpretation of ideas of the philosophical founder of Marxist Communism. Hook tried to integrate Marxism with the pragmatist philosophy expounded by C.S. <PERSON> Peirce </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Dewey </LOCATION>. His second book, `` From <PERSON> Hegel </PERSON> to Marx: Studies in the Intellectual Development of <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>,'' published in 1936, is a scholastic classic, considered one of the best critical expositions of Marxism ever by an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> philosopher. Hook never joined the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and rejected the idea that the attainment of socialism or a planned economy could or should be accomplished by sacrificing democratic ideals and institutions. His best-known work, `` The Hero in History,'' published in 1943, is still widely used in college classrooms. In 1951, <PERSON> Hook </PERSON> founded the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION>. He was an early critic of Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, a controversial Republican who charged that communists had infiltrated the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. Hook expounded his views on issues of that era in two books, one titled, `` Heresy, Yes _ Conspiracy, No!'' He was born in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on December 20, 1902. He graduated from <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1923, earned a master's degree at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1926 and received a doctorate from <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> in 1927. He is survived by his wife, <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>, two sons and a daughter.

 An underwater volcano erupted Thursday off central <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, spewing plumes of smoke and ash into the air and creating tremors that shook the <LOCATION> Izu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>. There were no reports of injuries or damage, but callers jammed telephone lines for hours after the eruption a mile off the coast of <LOCATION> Ito </LOCATION> <LOCATION> city </LOCATION>, a seaside resort 62 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Hundreds of <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>'s 72,000 residents fled, and city officials were considering evacuating people living near the shore, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> issued a navigation warning to ships in the area. The volcano erupted at 6:30 p.m. on the ocean floor at a depth of 330 feet, the <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. Officials said earlier it occurred at a depth of up to about 1,000 feet. `` Right now, we do n't know if this will lead to another, larger eruption and can only tell people there to watch for further warnings,'' said an agency official. `` Obviously, there could be danger to <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> if a larger eruption occurs,'' he said, requesting anonymity. The Japanese archipelago is of volcanic origin, and 80 volcanoes are believed to be active. For hours after the eruption, calls to the Ito Police Department and City Hall were met with recorded messages asking callers to try later due to `` extremely crowded lines.'' Along with the strong jolt of the eruption, slight tremors, possibly caused by the volcano, were felt throughout the evening, said the official from the <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Seismologists were surveying movements of underground magma in the area. Large movements of magma can cause earthquakes, which often preceed volcanic eruptions. More than 20,000 earthquakes have been recorded around <LOCATION> Izu </LOCATION> over the past two weeks. An official of the Seismic Division of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the nature of the quakes had changed since Tuesday night, with the most recent quakes occurring more frequently and lasting up to 20 seconds. On Wednesday, there were eight such temblors recorded, he said. Between June 30 and noon Thursday, 22,328 temblors were recorded off the <LOCATION> Izu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. Most were at depths of two to 4.5 miles under the sea. Twenty-one people suffered minor injuries when two earthquakes registering 5.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale hit <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> on Sunday.

 A gun dealer is offering for sale seven guns purportedly used by a sniper when he shot and killed 14 people from the top of a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> tower in 1966. The three rifles, one shotgun and three pistols are said to be the ones used in the attack by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitman </PERSON>. In all, <PERSON> Whitman </PERSON> killed 16 people and wounded 31 others. He killed his mother and his wife before climbing the 307-foot tower in the center of the <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> campus, where he was a student. Police stormed the tower and killed <PERSON> Whitman </PERSON>, 25. Austin Police Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON> said Thursday that the guns used in the attack were turned over to <PERSON> Whitman </PERSON>'s estate and were later sold at auction. The guns have been advertised by <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Buxton </PERSON> in the past three issues of a gun collectors' publication, the Austin American-Statesman and the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The American-Statesman said <PERSON> Buxton </PERSON> instructed editors of `` Shotgun News'' not to divulge his name or phone number to callers. The newspaper said it linked the post office box number given in the classified ad to <PERSON> Buxton </PERSON>, who owns a gun and pawn shop in the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Garland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Buxton </PERSON> did not return telephone calls Thursday to his home and shop from The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The gun dealer told the newspapers he does n't want to discuss what the ads call The Whitman Colection because `` there's too much pain in the state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>'' associated with the slayings. `` I have no interest whatsoever in resurrecting pain or any sad feelings,'' he said. `` It's a source of pain to certain people, and I do n't want to get into that.'' The Chronicle said <PERSON> Buxton </PERSON>, who is seeking $ 7,500 for the collection, would not say how he obtained the weapons, but claims they are authentic. He said he is not a Whitman relative. <ORGANIZATION> KDFW-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Buxton </PERSON> told the station he does not own the weapons, but is acting as the agent for the owner, whom he would not identify. The ad offers the guns, a radio, binoculars, cameras and a knife for money or in trade for historical <LOCATION> Winchester </LOCATION> rifles or Colt pistols, the Chronicle said. The ad also offers a copy of a 1966 Life magazine reporting the slaughter.

 Leaders of the world's seven major industrial democracies gather in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on Friday for their 15th annual economic summit, surrounded by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s bicentennial hoopla and with a comfortable sense of economic self-satisfaction. The oil crises, inflationary pressures, monetary instability and other woes that dominated previous summits seem contained, giving the government leaders time to take an unhurried look at matters such as the environment and Third World debt. The surge in the dollar that started in June, sending economic shivers down the backs of many a government official, has been cooled after massive intervention by central banks selling dollars. An optimistic <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> emphasized the Western economies are doing well and the coordination process among the seven _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> _ is working.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is still hospitalizing citizens who are not mentally ill, says a team of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> health experts who recommend additional reforms to prevent confinement of political dissidents. The 26-member delegation's report, released Wednesday, said broad concepts of `` social dangerousness'' have contributed to the Soviet practice of hospitalizing people who are not mentally ill. In response, the Soviet side expressed disagreement with some aspects of the study, but nonetheless called it a `` valuable and useful document.'' The delegation visited the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> from Feb. 26 to March 12 to assess recent changes in Soviet psychiatry. They examined 15 patients and 12 former patients who had been released within the preceding two years.

We want to show people that garbage does n't just disappear. That it's not just by magic,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, a spokesman for the center. The plans for the museum come at a time when communities across the nation are considering ways to recycle some of their trash. A third of the country's 6,000 dumps will close during in the next five years, driving up disposal costs.

 The rehearsal room fills with British accents as actors break for lunch after spending a recent morning trying to sound as <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> as apple pie. It's all in a day's work at the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, which is reviving the classic 1939 American comedy `` The Man Who Came to Dinner,'' by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. The RSC had a 1979 hit with <PERSON> Trevor </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>'s production of <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s `` Once in a Lifetime,'' which went on to a commercial West End run. `` The Man Who Came to Dinner'' opens at the Barbican Theater on July 20, and runs in repertory through September 12. `` This play is superlatively well put together. With any luck, it's one of those wonderful comic machines,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, the Englishman who plays the irascible dinner guest, <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> <PERSON> Whiteside </PERSON>. The supporting cast includes such RSC stalwarts as <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Haddon </PERSON> <PERSON> Haines </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marjorie </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> as <PERSON> Whiteside </PERSON>'s hosts, the <ORGANIZATION> Stanleys </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiennes </PERSON> as the local newspaperman, <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Whiteside </PERSON>, a wicked caricature of the celebrated wit and theater critic <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Woollcott </PERSON>, is a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> radio celebrity who ends up housebound with an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> family when a dinner invitation becomes a comedy of misadventures. <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolley </PERSON> originated the part in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and in the 1941 film, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morley </PERSON> was its first <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> star. <PERSON> Morley </PERSON>'s son, theater critic <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> <PERSON> Morley </PERSON>, was born that year, and was named after <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> <PERSON> Whiteside </PERSON>. The play is ripe with <PERSON> Whiteside </PERSON>'s acid-tongued lines: _ <PERSON> Whiteside </PERSON> in introducing his secretary to <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>: `` This aging debutante, Mr. <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, I retain in my employ only because she is the sole support of her two-headed brother.'' The play was most recently seen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1980 at Circle in the Square, directed by and starring <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabb </PERSON>. The latest revival marks the RSC directing debut of Broadway veteran <ORGANIZATION> Gene </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION>, who is most often associated with the plays of <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. His staging of <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s farce, `` Rumors,'' is a current Broadway hit. <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> had only worked in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> once before, restaging his Broadway musical hit `` I Love My Wife'' for the West End, when the RSC approached him. `` I found this offer very flattering,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> in an interview. `` They said, ` We wanted an American to do it and who knows more about American comedy than you do?' I said, ` Well, now I'll have to do it.''' <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> came to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in March to meet with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, whom he knew socially during <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>'s longtime residency in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> starring in `` Deathtrap,'' `` Travesties'' and `` Amadeus.'' He called <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> `` a very special, tremendously talented and experienced actor who can teach anybody a lot.'' Wood stars as <PERSON> Prospero </PERSON> in `` The Tempest'' at the <ORGANIZATION> RSC </ORGANIZATION>, and will play the doomed <PERSON> Halvard </PERSON> <PERSON> Solness </PERSON> in <PERSON> Henrik </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibsen </PERSON>'s `` The Master Builder,'' opening there Sept. 26. The actor said he responded with some diffidence to the offer to play <PERSON> Whiteside </PERSON>, adding that the role's unusual demands require a masseur. <PERSON> Whiteside </PERSON> is wheelchair-bound for much of the play, having slipped and broken his hip. `` This is lower backpain on an operatic scale,'' said <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> liked the lesser pressures and diminished intensity of working at the <ORGANIZATION> RSC </ORGANIZATION>, where shows are guaranteed a run, as opposed to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where they can close overnight. `` I'm always shocked at the reaction of the -LRB- <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> -RRB- press and of some of the public,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION>, who, besides his string of <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> hits, directed two recent Broadway flops: <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Larbey </PERSON>'s play `` A Month of Sundays,'' and the musical `` Rags.'' `` I want to say, ` It's after all only a play. If you did n't like it, that's your prerogative, but let's go on to the next one.''' Instead, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> failures are, he said, `` left like a street accident with blood all over them.'' The RSC reminded <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> of the Actors' Studio, where he trained as an actor in the 1940s. `` There's a real revolution against phony, traditional acting,'' he said. `` They all seem to want to be truthful and get underneath things, the same as good actors are doing in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` There's less and less difference between the two.''

<HEAD>South African Sculptor Predicts Peace in His Work</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ELIM, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new world is coming in which people will behave like fish, predicts <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Hlungwane </PERSON>, a self-made preacher and perhaps <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s most significant sculptor. `` Fish shine. They're peaceful. They do n't fight with everything,'' <PERSON> Hlungwane </PERSON> said in an interview, wiggling his hips to show how fish move smoothly through water. Massive carved fish lie on the earth, amid chickens and barefoot children in <LOCATION> Mbhokota </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hlungwane </PERSON>'s village near <LOCATION> Elim </LOCATION>, in the northeastern black homeland of <LOCATION> Gazankulu </LOCATION>. More of the sculptor's fish rest among the black art collection at the prestigious University of the Witwatersrand In August, <PERSON> Hlungwane </PERSON> will have his first one-man show in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s largest city. The works of this unschooled former laborer command thousands of dollars in the white-controlled world of galleries and art connoisseurs. The Weekly Mail newspaper called him `` one of the real innocents among the rural carvers.'' `` He's unself-conscious, a visionary who happens to be an artist,'' said painter <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, one of a committee of friends formed to manage <PERSON> Hlungwane </PERSON>'s funds and artistic career, and who is organizing the August exhibit. `` He's probably the most important sculptor in the country. The content of his work points to peace, freedom and ethical values, like love.'' Visitors to <PERSON> Mbhokota </PERSON> may find Hlungwane in a field, digging holes for the foundation of a new house of worship for women. Men who belong to the sculptor's `` One <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Omega </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'' worship higher up a hill, at a site called <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. He preaches twice a week. <PERSON> Hlungwane </PERSON> says religion and art are the same thing. `` I do the work of God by carving,'' he said. `` Art comes from all my body.'' He prefers to talk about his apocalyptic vision of sin and strife being replaced by brotherhood, and about peace in racially divided <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` When you go up -LRB- to heaven -RRB- in the big smoke, you must carry everything you've done and show God,'' he said. `` It is better to negotiate than to kill. Whites must stop the gun and blacks must stop the club.'' Collectors value <PERSON> Hlungwane </PERSON>'s work for its form, as well as its meaning. The <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> site contains skillfully shaped figures of <PERSON> Cain </PERSON>, <PERSON> Abel </PERSON>, the angel <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> and Christ. A tall pole bears automobile lights and reflectors, crosses and a representation of the Holy Ghost. The pieces, cut from large limbs found in nearby forests, are unprotected. They turn gray and crack in wind and rain. Nearby lies a huge tree trunk from which <PERSON> Hlungwane </PERSON> is carving a figure of <PERSON> Adam </PERSON>. `` There are touches of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in his work. He has a feel for nature and observes it closely,'' <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said. Hlungwane is vague about the details of his life. The son of a miner, he is about 66, married with 12 children. He quit work after losing a finger in an industrial accident, declaring that any machine that could take a finger would wind up taking an arm. `` I do n't take money; money is trouble. I want your heart,'' <PERSON> Hlungwane </PERSON> tells visitors. `` When you have given me your heart, you have paid me.'' After people took him at his word and began carrying off sculptures without paying for them, <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> and others in the <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> art world formed a management committee for Hlungwane. Near the village is a riverbank where Hlungwane once buried deep in the earth a life-size carving of a horse. He later spent days in an unsuccessful search to retrieve the sculpture. Near the river is a hill where <PERSON> Hlungwane </PERSON> has dug foundation holes for a new and different project _ a gasoline station and hotel. Members of his management committee are puzzled, but <PERSON> Hlungwane </PERSON> has no doubts. `` The garage and <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> are the same thing,'' he said. `` <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> is the center of the whole world. And all routes go by this garage, from <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zululand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>.''

<TEXT>
 The stars are hanging out in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, and they're not just in the sky. Projects featuring such movie actors as <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON>, <PERSON> Natasha </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Debra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Winger </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolte </PERSON> are solidifying <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> as a hotbed for moviemaking. `` They're major caliber people and major caliber projects. Both of those are looking at Academy Award-type situations,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. In the past few months, two movies with those actors have been shooting in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>: `` The Handmaid's Tale'' in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, and `` Everybody Wins'' in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>. `` I think we started out with major films and higher caliber pictures than had been the general rule in the South,'' <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION> said. Starting with such movies as `` Being There,'' starring <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sellers </PERSON>, in 1979 and `` Brainstorm,'' starring <PERSON> Natalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, in 1983, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> has also made <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON>'s `` The Color Purple,'' `` The Year of the Dragon'' and many others. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> is one of the fastest growing moviemaking locations in the country, and is second to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in the number of sound stages and studios, <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION> said, with 18 sound stages and four studios with plans for a fifth. `` We also have the largest resident work force of crew and technical people on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, after <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' he said. Still, even though 42 states have film offices and actively compete for business, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> remains the film leader of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> close at its heels. Though not always cheaper, it's easier to make a movie outside <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. One-stop, state-controlled film offices are preferred to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s patchwork approach, where local governments issue permits with fluctuating fees and have requirements that are 70 years old. And the long-held belief that <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> could re-create anything from the Tara plantation in `` Gone With the Wind'' to the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> in `` One From the Heart'' has been abandoned by filmmakers who want greater realism. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s moderate climate and diverse landscape are attractive to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> producers. `` It's the best,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroud </PERSON>, location manager for `` The Handmaid's Tale.'' `` Everyone makes it so easy for you, and the bureaucracy is nil. This really is the ideal place to film _ I think the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, in general.'' The movies `` Bull Durham,'' a delightful romp about life in minor league baseball, and `` Winter People,'' a drama about intense relations starring <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> McGillis </PERSON> were both filmed in 1987. `` ` Winter People' is a depression-era, very cold, snowy film. ` <ORGANIZATION> Bull </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Durham </ORGANIZATION>' is just the opposite,'' <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> said. `` But they were both shot in November and they both got what they want.'' Since <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> can offer a variety of `` looks,'' film company have fewer location moves. `` The Handmaid's Tale,'' which is being filmed entirely in the state, needed seasonal changes and also the look of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> college, which it found at <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Based on the acclaimed novel by <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON>, the book is a daring move into the future and tells the tale of what happens after a right-wing religious revolution has swept <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, imposing a dictatorial regime and ruthlessly executing any dissenters. In 1982, the science-fiction movie `` Brainstorm'' filmed in six different locations without leaving <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lure </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> mountains served as the backdrop for much of the musical `` Dirty Dancing,'' which <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION> calls one of the most successful made in the state. `` It cost them -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Vestron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- $ 2.3 million to shoot that here,'' <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> said. `` They've been back here twice since. That movie has generated more than $ 750 million. That's a tremendous return. That's the kind of thing that really sells the state.'' <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s return also has been tremendous. Since the state's film office was established in 1980, it has spent only $ 1.05 million to attract moviemakers _ none of it on advertising like many states do, such as <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> even offered a 5 percent rebate. `` The film industry is really very small,'' <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION> said. `` If <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> is a good place to shoot, everybody will know it. We have put our emphasis on making sure the people who come here get what they were promised they'd get.'' Films, TV movies, commercials and videos have pumped $ 1.6 billion into the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> economy over the past nine years, including $ 297 million generated by 19 productions in 1988. Producers say they can make a movie cheaper in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> _ a right to work state _ partly because they have a choice of whether to use union or non-union actors and technicians. Money can be saved by hiring non-union extras for movies with large casts, but many films made outside <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> use union crews because their Hollywood-based production companies must honor contracts with talent and craft unions. `` The cost of an average movie in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> is $ 18 million,'' <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION> said. `` <PERSON> Dino </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurentiis </PERSON> -LRB- whose studio was based in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> -RRB- two years ago said the average cost in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> is $ 9 million. `` It has grown at a rate that it's been comfortable for the state to accommodate. It's been very beneficial.'' The economic impact is mostly indirect, through money film companies spend on hotels, food, supplies, equipment and location fees. When <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s `` Firestarter'' was filming in 1983, <LOCATION> Orton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plantation </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION> was used as major location. `` They needed to burn that to the ground in a final scene,'' <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> said. `` What they had to do was re-create the facade, and they spent $ 80,000 ... to burn it in one whack.'' A service station operator pumped $ 6,000 worth of gas in one day for production company trucks and cars when `` Brainstorm'' was being shot. The direct impact, though, comes by way of income taxes. The movies made in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> have created 53,000 jobs, including actors, extras, crew people and drivers. `` Basically, a film company will come into a community and drop literally millions of dollars _ it's a great economic boost,'' <PERSON> Stroud </PERSON> said. `` You do n't have to go out and browbeat a community to get involved,'' said <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>. `` In general, the citizens are very excited about making movies.''

 <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Groening </PERSON> had been asked to pitch ideas for an animated television show before, but network executives did n't quite get it. `` They would say, what do you want to do?'' <PERSON> Groening </PERSON> recalled, `` and I'd say, I want a show with the wit and charm of ` Bullwinkle.' And they'd say, you do n't understand, we're trying to appeal to 3-year-olds. I'd say, I do a cartoon called ` Life in Hell'. Why did you want to talk to me?'' Producer-director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> -LRB- `` The <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> Show,'' `` Broadcast News'' -RRB- knew exactly what <PERSON> Groening </PERSON>'s `` Life in Hell'' cartoon was all about. The strip is carried by `` alternative'' weekly newspapers around the country, such as The Village Voice. <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Groening </PERSON> to create the brief `` bumpers,'' cartoon vignettes, that lead in and out of commercials during `` The <PERSON> Tracey </PERSON> <PERSON> Ullman </PERSON> Show,'' of which <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> is executive producer. The Simpsons, a homely, squabbling brood of <LOCATION> Middle-Americans </LOCATION>, became such a hit on `` Ullman,'' <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> is spinning them off into their own series. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> wo n't yet say when, but sometime during the next season, <PERSON> Tracey </PERSON> <PERSON> Ullman </PERSON> and company will bid adieu to the <PERSON> Simpsons </PERSON>, the week before they embark on their own show. It will be the first prime-time, network animated series since `` The Jetsons'' and `` The Flintstones'' in the 1960s. `` The Simpsons'' is set in the mythical Midwestern city of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, a burg replete with a nuclear power plant and a toxic waste dump. The voices of Homer, <PERSON> Marge </PERSON> and their kids, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON>, are provided by <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Castellanata </PERSON> and <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kavner </PERSON>, both of `` The <PERSON> Tracey </PERSON> <PERSON> Ullman </PERSON> Show,'' <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cartwright </PERSON>, <PERSON> Yeardley </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and celebrity guest voices, such as <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shearer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Penny </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, <PERSON> Groening </PERSON> and producer-writer <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> told a meeting of television critics that they just do n't know what <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will think of the <PERSON> Simpsons </PERSON> once audiences start getting a bigger dose of their darkly funny sitcom antics. Someone wondered whether <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was in fact receiving enough cutting satire of sitcom families in <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s `` Married ... With Children.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> insisted, almost maintaining a straight face, that the <PERSON> Simpsons </PERSON> are unlike the unscrupulous and conniving Bundys and really do love each other, deep down. `` They do n't hate each other,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. `` If they do occasionally strangle each other or hit each other over the head, it's just an impulsive act.'' `` Whether they will go over, whether these drawn figures will go over, we do n't know,'' <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> said. The <PERSON> Simpsons </PERSON>, who look very much like the wild-eyed rabbits who populate <PERSON> Groening </PERSON>'s `` Life in Hell'' strip, derived from an `` unpublishable novel'' <PERSON> Groening </PERSON> said he wrote in high school, `` Mean Kids.'' <PERSON> Groening </PERSON> said he never expected to become a cartoonist, since `` my drawing did n't improve much after sixth grade.'' He describes the <PERSON> Simpsons </PERSON> as having `` large, round eyes, and a tremendous overbite problem'' _ basically, his rabbits without the giant ears. `` Maybe someday <PERSON> Marge </PERSON> will take off a wig and reveal her true identity,'' he teased. <PERSON> Groening </PERSON> said he does fervently hope that <PERSON> Binky </PERSON> and the other rabbits from `` Life in Hell'' might get their own TV series, too, someday. `` Someday,'' <PERSON> Groening </PERSON> said, `` maybe television will be ready for my hellish stuff.''

<HEAD>Capital Gains Tax Cut: Dead or Alive?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 While President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> still supports a cut in the capital gains tax rate, the chances of it occurring this year have dimmed, largely because it got caught up in politics. Opposition to a cut, which would have made it financially less costly to sell stocks that have risen in value, was largely based on fears among elected officials that the public would view a cut as a gift to the rich. Lost amid the concern were such arguments that a cut might actually raise federal revenues, helping to lower the deficit; that it might be fairer, and that it might encourage business formations and the creation of jobs. True or false, the `` gift to the rich'' brand, promoted by opponents of a cut, is a brand that could harass an elected official for the rest of his or her political days, which could be brief if voters took it to heart. True, it might help the rich, but true also is the assertion that it might help the less-than-rich, as Professor <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> indicated in testimoney before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Suppose, he said, that 20 years ago you managed to buy one unit of the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average, which at the time was selling for about $ 900. A small investment, to be sure, but one that grew to a high of $ 2,700 in 1987. You would have an $ 1,800 capital gain, which might seem to be a compliment to your great patience and your ability to withstand the risk of violent market ups and downs. Then you figure the tax: state and federal, roughly one-third. Quite a belt, but that is n't even the tough part. Even tougher to digest is the realization that an enormous amount of that is simply inflation. Inflation is bad enough, but you might conclude that to be taxed on it is insulting. The fact of the matter is you would have come out a loser _ not a gainer _ for your risk-taking and patience. Economist <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON> points out that for you to have merely broken even you would have had to sell at $ 3,000, not $ 2,700. That, of course, would have been impossible, since the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average has never in its history reached that level, having plunged right after reaching 2,700 points. It is now around 2,500 points. Drowned out by the gift-to-the-rich contention is the assertion that a cut would raise federal revenues by billions of dollars a year. The thesis is backed by various studies, but most convincingly by history, since a capital gains tax reduction in 1979 was followed by a sharp increase in revenue. Not everyone agrees that a cut would increase revenues year after year. Some critics say the impact might be felt mainly in the first year or two, when investors with long-term gains would be enticed into cashing in their assets. And, in fact, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Minarik </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> argues, `` the history of the last decade is not favorable to the claims of revenue raising through capital gains tax cuts.'' But, while <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and academics argued about the numbers, the thesis was never shot down, i.e., proven without any doubt to be incorrect. Instead, the lure of extra billions of dollars in revenues, even by a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> desperately searching for ways to close the budget gap, just was n't strong enough to withstand the political damage of a gift to the rich. In theory, anyway, a capital gains tax might also lead to higher federal revenues in an entirely different way, by spurring investors and entrepreneurs into forming new businesses which, if they grow, become taxpayers. But, unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has a change of heart, such a cut is not destined to be passed this year _ for rich investors or ordinary folks such as those who buy mutual funds.

<DATELINE>SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Like a lot of couples, <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> taught their teen-age sons the family business. It was n't your typical Mom-and-Pop operation _ the <ORGANIZATION> Schultzes </ORGANIZATION> were into robbery For <PERSON> William </PERSON>, 16, and <PERSON> Matt </PERSON>, 15, the tools of the trade were AK-47s, police scanners, surveillance and survival gear, maps, wigs, even hypnosis, police say. They were trained in hand-to-hand combat, went through daily routines of jogging, situps and pushups, and memorized streets, zones and police codes. There were dry runs and days of scrupulously logging police movement. Files police found in a rented home near <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> included blueprint-like drawings and maps showing distances to police and fire stations, hospitals, malls, railroad terminals and streets leading to interstate highways. After a job, the two teens would be hypnotized and debriefed. `` Some sessions were more detailed than others,'' said Detective <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Drone </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Kenneth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION>. `` The reason was if any mistakes were made during a robbery they could be corrected before the next one.'' One mistake the <ORGANIZATION> Schultzes </ORGANIZATION> made cost them; they pleaded guilty in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> to a botched robbery and drew a 10-year prison sentence. Documents police found in the house left no doubt the <ORGANIZATION> Schultzes </ORGANIZATION> thought of it as a business. There were ledger entries for expenditures. A contract dealt with firearm purchases, handling of loot, and standards of behavior. `` No greed will be tolerated for personal use and pleasure,'' it warned, according to investigators. Police do n't know much about the family. <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON>, 29, was at one time a trucker. His 35-year-old wife was a onetime exotic dancer and was married to a <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, man named <PERSON> Hinton </PERSON>, who fathered the boys and since has died. The <ORGANIZATION> Schultzes </ORGANIZATION> told their landlady, <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> <PERSON> Penney </PERSON>, they were <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> last September when they rented the three-bedroom country home she owned on 10 acres near <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION>. They said they'd be there two years <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> told Mrs. <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> he was a Marine on special assignment at <ORGANIZATION> MacDill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, 70 miles away. `` I was n't suspicious I did n't know they were criminals,'' she said, adding that the boys were polite, but did n't seem to go to school and dressed mostly in military clothes. Over the months, Mrs. <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> grew wary of Mrs. <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON>, who demanded several days' notice before the landlady could visit, then was rude to her. `` I was getting kind of scared of her. The others would come around and apologize, make excuses for her that she was having a bad day or the like.'' The first police knew of the <ORGANIZATION> Schultzes </ORGANIZATION> was a six-month spree of robberies and burglaries that began in the <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> area in May 1988. On Nov. 26, the <ORGANIZATION> Schultzes </ORGANIZATION> sat outside a <LOCATION> Kenneth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> restaurant while the two teens and a runaway they had picked up took $ 3,000 - $ 4,000 at gunpoint, <PERSON> Drone </PERSON> said On Dec. 1, Mrs. <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> got the November rent. `` <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> opened his wallet and I saw a stack of big bills, two inches thick. It was loaded; there were hundreds. I said, ` What did you do, rob a bank?''' <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> said no, then told her he was going to <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> on business and would be back in a few weeks. But the family fled. `` It looked like they got out in a hurry,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> said. They left behind two big dogs, their clothes and a $ 300 electric bill. Gone were the stove, dining room table and fans, and the carpet was ruined. One bedroom was painted in military camouflage colors. A barrel on the wooded lot had been used for target practice and looked like swiss cheese. Shots had been fired into the barn. Empty ammunition shells were scattered around and there were three homemade obstacle courses in the front yard. Scared by a local crime-reenactment TV show, the <ORGANIZATION> Schultzes </ORGANIZATION> headed home to <LOCATION> Churchville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, starting back south in January or February, police say. They made it as far as <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, where police nabbed the two <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> boys and a runaway from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> after the botched armed robbery of a businessman as he made a night deposit, said Sgt. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON>. Police recovered all but $ 110 of the $ 1,180 cash and $ 300 in checks. Some was stashed in a motel light globe and $ 300 was in a refrigerator drip tray, he said. `` The light globe had been lined with tissue paper so the money was not visible even when you shined a flashlight on it. Some of the stuff was ingenious.'' Police confiscated an AK-47 and 750 rounds of ammunition, a .45 - caliber pistol with 130 rounds, an automatic rifle with 300 rounds, magazine clips and a number of military-type knives, <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON> `` They had enough weapons and ammo to keep us held off the better part of a week.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Schultzes </ORGANIZATION> pleaded guilty last month to the robbery. A judge sentenced the adults to 10 years to run concurrently with any sentence in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The boys' unspecified sentence is to be parallel and concurrent to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s. The family was extradited last month and pleaded innocent July 7 to charges stemming from three shoe-store robberies, one each at a computer software store and a yogurt shop, and burglaries of a restaurant and three schools. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinton </PERSON>, now 17, face 24 counts each of conspiracy, robbery with a firearm, burglary and grand theft. Each is being held on nearly $ 500,000 bond. <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinton </PERSON> was indicted by a grand jury on 19 counts as an adult and is being held on $ 200,000 bond. They are to be tried Oct. 23. Police traced the family to the rented home and found shotguns, ammunition and 60 pounds of spent shells. They also seized a three-inch-thick file giving more than a glimpse into the carefully orchestrated, resourceful operation that included runaways the adults brought into the fold. The contract they found reads in part: `` Any and all firearms will be bought by the business and held by the overseer for proper use.'' Stolen money would be `` cleaned and unmarked by overseer <PERSON> Matt </PERSON>.'' Big expenditures `` would not be allowed in one lump sum as it might be traced back.'' Anyone who took drugs or alcohol within seven days of a job would be excluded. Traceable items had to be destroyed. There also were individual's notes: `` three days ago, stopped smoking ... you can beat anybody but <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> ... you are smart, smarter than the cops ... you feel no pain ... wo n't remember being hypnotized.'' Jobs were carefully planned. For a grocery store stickup, they figured 20 seconds to open the safe, 15 seconds to grab the money, 10 to get out followed by a 100-yard dash. Police were two-fifths of a mile away. They had 36 seconds to run half the driveway with maybe 12 stacks of money totaling 20-30 pounds. `` They were big on changing appearances for different jobs,'' Drone said, changing hair style and color, even dressing the boys as girls. `` Here were parental figures training kids to commit violent crimes. The biggest travesty is the effect on these kids probably for the rests of their lives.'' `` They used their kids,'' said <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> Sheriff's Dept. spokesman Cpl. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Bessette </PERSON>. `` That's the most unfortunate thing. The saddest and sickest part of this whole thing is that the actual victims here are the kids.''

 While <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> marks the 20th anniversary of man's landing on the moon, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has on its wish list a permanent scientific lunar outpost early next century. When astronauts <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> and <PERSON> Buzz </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldrin </PERSON> set foot in the lunar dust July 20, 1969, some scientists saw it as a logical step toward building a research base there. But no overwhelming public or political support developed for such an expensive undertaking, and blueprints were shelved. Some scientists continued through the years to yearn for a moon base. Mineral-rich lunar soil could support crops grown under pressurized domes, researchers say, and a commercially valuable gas, prevalent on the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION>, could be returned to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> where it is rare. The scientists have a glimmer of hope in a document released last December by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Exploration, `` Beyond Earth's Horizons _ Human Exploration of the Solar System in the 21st Century.'' It outlined possibilities for two moon bases among four potential manned expeditions. The other two involve flights to the <LOCATION> Martian </LOCATION> moon <LOCATION> Phobos </LOCATION> and to Mars itself. One of the moon bases envisioned would not be permanently staffed. It would serve chiefly as an astronomy laboratory where telescopes, free of the Earth's obscuring atmosphere and interfering electronic transmissions, could study the most distant radioemitting galaxies and search for extraterrestrial life. The exploration office plan puts this unmanned base on the moon's far side, which is permanently hidden from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> Each of four successive four-person crews would work through a 14-day lunar day, setting up equipment delivered by unmanned cargo vehicles, before returning to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> or an orbiting space station as a 14-day night begins. Staying through a frigid lunar night would require considerable extra support equipment. Once the observatory is built the telescopes would operate automatically, sending images and data to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> through a satellite orbiting the moon, or the ground could direct them to look at certain celestial objects. Astronauts would return to the base every three years to service the equipment and to collect and replace telescope film. The second base, on the front side of the moon, would be permanently manned. Many astronaut crews over several years would be required to construct an Antarctic-type facility, using raw building materials already there. The Apollo missions disclosed that every shovelful of lunar soil is rich in metals and silicon and that this soil can be mixed with water to form a type of cement. Oxygen is the most abundant element on the moon, and this can be combined with hydrogen to make water. Because oxygen is five-sixths of what rocket engines burn, the base could also serve as a tank farm for spacecraft flying between <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and the moon or embarking for Mars or elsewhere in the solar system. A lunar resource of potentially great commercial value is helium-3, an isotope of helium with one neutron and two protons, instead of the two neutrons and two protons in ordinary helium. Physicists see it as a cleaner, more efficient alternative to the fuels foreseen for conventional fusion reactors to generate electrical power. On Earth, helium-3 exists only in very small quantities as a by-product of nuclear weapons production. But on the moon it is abundant, deposited by the sun's charged particles. Studies done by the <ORGANIZATION> Fusion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> indicate that as little as 40,000 pounds of helium-3 could be transported to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> on just two lunar return trips. Used in a national array of fusion reactors, this amount could supply the energy needs of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for a year. The exploration office study says either or both moon bases could be started early in the next century. The report did not include expedition costs, but <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, chief of the office, said, `` It's clear that in order to do these things you are going to have to spend more money, a larger percentage of the federal budget.''

<HEAD>To Work or Not? Some Say Jobs and School Don't Mix</HEAD>

 To work or not to work? The question never comes up in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where school is considered the only job fit for students. But American teen-agers are working in droves, much of their cash going for cars, clothes, beer and sometimes drugs. They are perhaps learning the work ethic. But they are also learning conspicuous consumption, and some critics say they are compromising their education as well. When she was named National Teacher of the Year last April, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Bicouvaris </PERSON> singled out working students and asked them to put a priority on school. `` They are very busy people,'' she said. `` What I find deplorable many times is they work school into the business schedule rather than fit business into the school schedule.'' Most studies have shown little or no effect on school performance if students keep their work time to 20 hours a week. But the studies are based on averages that do n't apply to individual students. Plus, there are no federal hourly restrictions on teen-agers of 16 and 17, and many work far more than 20 hours. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION>, which surveys tens of thousands of students on academic proficiency and recently added questions on work, estimates that more than half of all 11th graders and two-thirds of high school seniors have jobs. Teachers all have their stories about students whose work lives have eclipsed their school lives, who leave the classroom to work seven hours at a fast-food restaurant and show up the next day unprepared, their heads nodding onto their desks. `` They will tell you, ` I just do n't have time to do that assignment. I have to work,' and they expect you to buy that,'' says <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Welsh </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, English teacher who has written a book about high school. `` I do n't buy it,'' he adds. `` But what happens is a gradual and subtle erosion of standards and the amount of work you're going to hit kids with. It's happening all over the country.'' A <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> study of four high schools did indeed find teachers were making less demands on students than they had made five years before, at least partially in response to the students' work schedules. Work also has been associated with increased drug and alcohol use. Working kids have more money, are under more stress and may come into contact with older teen-agers more likely to have such habits, says <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> researcher and psychology professor. `` If your only outcome measure is test scores or grades, you may be missing something,'' says <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, co-author with <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberger </PERSON> of a book called `` When Teenagers Work.'' The book describes a 1982 study of 531 <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, teen-agers in which the authors found that work in excess of 15 to 20 hours a week tended to cause lower grades and diminished involvement in school. `` Earning and Learning,'' a recent report by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION>, said a review of other studies turned up no comparable results and added that `` there is no cause for alarm concerning the academic performance of students who work.'' But <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said his and <PERSON> Greenberger </PERSON>'s earlier results have been confirmed in a much larger study of 10,000 students in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> that has not yet been published. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Barton </PERSON>, author of the <ORGANIZATION> NAEP </ORGANIZATION> report, said he did not mean to suggest that `` this is a rosy situation for all students. The averages show no association between school and work, but individual circumstances should be taken into account. There are probably lots of kids buried in these averages who work long hours and do poorly, and I'm sure educators see them.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has by far the highest rate of working students in the world, with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> a distant second, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> says. `` Working while one goes to high school is unheard of in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' he says. `` The Japanese society is organized such that school is the only thing that kids are to be concerned about while they're teen-agers. In <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, parents often approve of and even push their children to work. Many like knowing where their kids are and believe strongly that a job, even if it is only flipping hamburgers at a fast-food joint, builds character and teaches good work habits. `` Parents have this thing about the work ethic. You teach your children to work very hard in jobs like waiting tables or pumping gas, and this is a sign of responsibility. But a lot of those kids get very poor grades and a lot of that money goes for beer on weekends,'' says <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawes </PERSON> have raised two valedictorians who went on to <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> colleges A third child with a straight-A average is headed for <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> this fall. The three, all boys, were never allowed to hold outside jobs. `` They were spending three to four hours a night on homework,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dawes </PERSON> says. `` My husband never wanted them to work during the school year. He had taken odd jobs during the school year and he just thought it was too much.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dawes </PERSON> says she saw many kids with `` a lot of money from their jobs and the parents did n't quite have the control of what the kids spent their money on. I think a lot of it went to alcohol in some cases. ... A lot of times what they want the money for is nothing substantial, a better polo shirt. It's not worth their working.''

 Statistics back up Mrs. <PERSON> Dawes </PERSON>' impression that most teen-agers are working for discretionary income, not money needed to support their families. Teenage Research Unlimited, a Chicago-area research firm, found that teens had $ 31 billion in income derived from jobs, allowances and other money from their parents in 1988. The average teen-ager earns $ 61.50 a week, the company reported, and it is almost exclusively discretionary. `` Teens now buy products and services ... such as hi-tech televisions, and VCRs, personal computers and automobiles,'' TRU said. Other high-priority items are cosmetics, clothes, and sports and recreation equipment. That kind of consumerism irks teachers who understand that while work is an economic necessity for some students, more seem to be earning money for designer clothes, car payments and entertainment. `` They place more value on the instant gratification than on the long-term value of getting a good education,'' says <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>, a former high school business teacher who is winding up a six-year tenure as president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` You do n't want to destroy the work ethic. But at the same time you know full well that this is interfering with their education,'' she adds. `` We need a better balance. We need to make sure young people and their families understand that the primary focus has to be on education. And if the job interferes with the education, they should quit the job.'' Teachers and others may bemoan their students' preoccupation with work, but the service sector's voracious need for employees assures that any student who wants a job will find one. Competition is so tough for older teens that employers are dipping deeper into the 14 - and 15-year-old age group In many cases, schools and parents are required to sign off on student work permits, giving them an opportunity to intervene if they think the job will be too much for the student to handle along with school. `` As it stands now, most schools do n't take advantage of that opportunity,'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said. He said that is because schools are susceptible to the demands of local industry and the need for good community relations. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said, principals `` told us employers would call them and say, ` We need more students. Can you let more of them out of school early?''' The press of unfilled jobs led the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to propose easing hourly restrictions on 14 - and 15-year-olds, who may now work only three hours on school days and no more than 18 hours a week when school is in session A <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> advisory committee concluded last fall that `` the prime responsibility for this age group should be toward their educational and developmental needs'' and said permissible work hours should not be expanded. The department is expected to heed the panel's recommendation. At the other end of the spectrum, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> legislators are pondering proposals to cut back work hours for 16 - and 17-year-olds, who are under no federal constraints Under Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s plan, they would be limited to four hours of work on school days and 28 hours a week while school is in session. In proposing the change last May, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> acknowledged that work experience can be valuable and that teen-agers are an important labor pool for state businesses. But he added that `` it would be very shortsighted for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to have any child labor policies that limit our young people's educational achievement.''

 The hermit of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> is emerging and what is seen is a regimented society that, in contrast to more liberal communism elsewhere, trains its 20 million people to obey every command of the state. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> claims to have achieved Paradise on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Its leaders declare with pride that the nation has no taxes, no prisons, no want, no social unrest. Well-informed outsiders, however, say the country has trouble feeding itself, is burdened with foreign debts and is rapidly falling behind the vibrant capitalist economy of rival <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Western journalists got a rare glimpse of a closed society during the World Festival of Youth and Students, held July 1-8 in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>. The meeting of 15,000 young people, most of them from left-leaning organizations, was the first major international event in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> capital and the city was carefully prepared as a showcase. <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> had a well-scrubbed look of prosperity. Tree-lined avenues were festooned with banners and flags, and balconies of well-kept apartment buildings were draped with flowers. Stores in the capital, which foreign residents said usually were poorly stocked, bulged with goods and shoppers. Visitors were given tours of kindergartens with chandeliers and indoor swimming pools, of hospitals outfitted with new Japanese and West German equipment, of homes with color televisions and refrigerators. They found another, jarring, element everywhere: total control of the populace and the pervasive personality cult of President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>, the 77-year-old `` Great Leader,'' and `` Dear Leader'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON>, his son and presumed successor. Above their hearts, North Koreans wear badges with the elder <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s portrait. Nearly every room of every office and home has a picture of the senior <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, and many have portraits of both Kims. Billboards and monuments recite and depict heroic deeds of the man who has led the North since the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> was divided in 1945, after the defeat of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in World War II. `` This is our happy land and it's all due to the Great Leader and the Dear Leader,'' said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> <PERSON> Sok </PERSON>, manager of a collective farm outside <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>. `` Some people call this Paradise on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>.'' Visitors heard the same statement again and again from other <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>, the national showcase, visitors see neat apartments of three or four rooms with central heating, hot water and basic appliances. The average factory worker is paid only about 100 won a month, $ 45 at the official rate, but enjoys free housing, education and medical care. Life is harder in the countryside. Many cottages do not have running water or private toilets, but in areas around the capital, stucco apartment buildings of two or three stories are being built to replace them. Several foreigners with extensive knowledge of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> said it has enormous problems. Many basic foods are rationed and, the foreigners said, the government often can not supply the average monthly meat allotment of 4.4 pounds per family. They said no fruit and few vegetables are available in winter. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Byong </PERSON> <PERSON> Hun </PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION> Kim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Il </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, denied food was in short supply. He said the reason for rationing rice was to build up reserves to feed <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> after reunification. A foreigner who has made 18 visits to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> said the government forces people to donate from their savings for the purpose, it says, of helping poor people in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Some of the rules are difficult to fathom. Bicycles are banned in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> even though cars are seldom seen on the broad boulevards. The few traffic lights at intersections were turned off. North Koreans said vehicles are scarce because the nation lacks petroleum deposits. This country's creed has become `` juche,'' a philosophy of self-reliance. Everyone does `` voluntary'' work for the government once a week. Tens of thousands were mobilized to help build stadiums and apartments when the North tried, in vain, to become co-host with the South of the 1988 Summer Olympics. The facilities were used for the youth festival. Where a person lives and works is not his business, but the state's. Although many homes have televisions, few have radios, apparently to prevent people from listening to foreign broadcasts. Several rural homes visited had wall loudspeakers used by local officials to broadcast instructions and ideological teachings. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has almost no private telephones. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Chol </PERSON> <PERSON> Sin </PERSON>, vice chairman of the Committee for Cultural Relations with <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>, denied claims by <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and other human rights groups that <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is a major abuser of human rights. In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, `` everyone has housing and free medical care and there's no unemployment,'' he said. `` How can countries with unemployment criticize us for human rights?'' The regimen appears to accomplish its aim. Several students stopped randomly at <ORGANIZATION> Kim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Il </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said they never would question government policy. `` In our country, students absolutely support the party,'' said Pak Song Ok, a 21-year-old studying the philosophy of `` juche.'' Economists said <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> will not follow other communist nations in experimenting with capitalist-style reform even though the growth rate is only 2 percent to 3 percent a year, compared to about 11 percent in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. `` We will not liberalize our economy and not put much stress on material incentives,'' said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hwa </PERSON> <PERSON> Chon </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Kim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Il </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He said workers receive some extra pay for exceeding quotas and farmers may grow vegetables in private plots around their homes, but the main rewards for hard work remain political: citations as model workers or appointments as deputies in local legislatures. The economist illustrated allegiance to the self-reliance creed by opening his shirt to show that even his T-shirt was a domestic product. Foreign debt has accumulated _ despite `` juche'' _ to somewhere between $ 5 billion and $ 8 billion, according to foreign observers. Dealing with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is a gamble, one foreign businessman said, because the government sometimes pays bills promptly and sometimes neglects them. Another said his company accepts only barter deals or cash in advance. Other foreigners said <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> finances imported technology for factories and limousines for high officials by selling gold and other precious metals. In its hesitant opening to the oustside world, the government has enacted a joint venture law and begun several projects, mainly with communist countries or overseas Koreans. A 105-story, pyramid-shaped hotel now dominates the <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> skyline. It is to be finished in 1990 for what <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> hopes will be a flood of tourists with wads of foreign currency.

 He is the `` Great Leader'' whose deeds are praised, whose portrait and words are everywhere. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> has nearly deified himself in his self-made world of regimentation and mass obedience. President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, who is 77 and has ruled <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> since the peninsula was divided in 1945, has crafted an unmatched cult of personality. Four-year-olds at Changgwang Kindergarten in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> sit around a detailed model of his birthplace, singing and chanting of his exploits. Children in another room carol, `` We wish good health and long life to <PERSON> Comrade </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshal </PERSON> <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>.'' At a nearby middle school, a 15-year-old recites to her English class: `` Thanks to the Great Leader and the Dear Leader, we have no worries about food or housing and we all lead happy lives.'' The Dear Leader is the president's son and heir apparent, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON>. A chair and desk in the library of <ORGANIZATION> Kim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Il </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> are a shrine, covered with a white cloth. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> sat there during a visit to the university in 1970. Stuffed animals he donated fill a display room at the university, which also contains a shotgun the Great Leader provided so students could add to the collection. At the main entrance of every school, institution, store, office and factory is a larger-than-life portrait of <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> in appropriate context. Hospitals show him counseling doctors; schools portray him receiving the adulation of children; in bookstores, his image bends over weighty tomes. Visitors to a factory or school are told how <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> stood on a nearby hill to order it built, then provided `` on-the-spot guidance'' now and then. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Hung </PERSON> <PERSON> Son </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>'s largest textile mill said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> had visited it 48 times. `` Only under the wise guidance of Great Leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> have we achieved prosperity,'' he declared <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> <PERSON> Sok </PERSON> of the Haksan collective farm outside <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> had visited 18 times to teach farmers which crops to grow and how to manage the enterprise. `` Parents only give children life, but the Great Leader takes care of all the people,'' he said. A huge stone monument that dominates the farm entrance is emblazoned with the words he uttered during his visits. Nearly every room of every home has a portrait of the Great Leader, often accompanied by one of the Dear Leader. Adults wear badges with <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>'s picture just above the heart. From billboards and statues, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> observes the streets and subway stations of <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>. An Arch of Triumph replica 200 feet high honors his achievements as a young revolutionary. More than 40,000 people a day visit the shrine of Mangyongdae, the thatch-roofed farmhouse on <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>'s outskirts where <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> was born in 1912. Equal numbers go to the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Revolution </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION>, which has 100 rooms and 140,000 items relating to his revolutionary accomplishments. Accounts in the museum say <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s great-grandfather helped sink a `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pirate ship'' that was scouting possible invasion routes in 1866. They say his father was a leader in fighting the Japanese, who ruled <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> from 1910 to 1945, and died young after imprisonment and torture. The Great Leader himself, it is said, left home at 13 to join the resistance and founded <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s first Communist organization a year later. Works by and about <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> fill <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>'s bookstores. One volume is titled `` A Great Man.'' It begins by saying history has recorded the stories of many great men, but `` none can match those of General <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>, genius of mankind produced by <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in the 20th century.'' His appearance in public can ignite a near-frenzy of celebration. At opening ceremonies of an international youth festival in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s arrival on his dais was the signal for fireworks to explode, doves to be released, trumpets to sound and thousands of Koreans to genuflect worshipfully. An economist, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hwa </PERSON> <PERSON> Chon </PERSON>, was asked about the high cost of building memorials to the Great Leader and replied: `` We never count the money for monuments. The hearts of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> people built them.''

<DATELINE>PYONGYANG, North Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Expert precision singing or dancing by tens of thousands is no trick for <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> because regimentation, to them, is the story of life. An international youth festival opened with ceremonies involving 70,000 youngsters from the host country, including a dazzling display of rapidly changing pictures by 50,000 card flashers. Most of the 20 million citizens were mobilized to make sure communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s first major international event would be a success. Nearly everyone in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> helped build <LOCATION> Kwangbok </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, a high-rise apartment complex for 25,000 families, which was finished in two years and housed festival delegates. Office workers `` volunteer'' for public service work once a week. Kindergarten teachers initiate a lifelong course in patriotism, absolute loyalty to the system and reverence for President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>. Ideological training and service to the state dominate the education system. Workers have political study sessions at least once a week. Songs, books, television, movies and loudspeaker announcements beamed into homes reinforce the message. For those not convinced an entire nation could be trained to obey, the youth offered some examples: _ Thousands of pedestrians along the airport road waved whenever a carload of foreigners passed _ Several hundred folk dancers in a city square stopped dancing and applauded when told through the loudspeaker of a passing bus that it carried foreigners _ A foreigner entered a department store and one order from his North Korean interpreter opened a path in the crowd so the visitor could be served first _ Buses and military trucks took thousands of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> to each festival event to make sure all were well-attended _ When festival delegates rallied at a school against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s suppression of pro-democracy students, about 1,000 North Koreans suddenly appeared and began dancing in the schoolyard, leaving no room for a

 Do n't tell <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> he ca n't buy <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. The quixotic bidder for the strikebound carrier may not have experience in the flying business but he's a math wizard who's vaulted over other daunting obstacles to build a successful company from scratch Along the way, he was a bus driver on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s southwest side, a prison guard and a deputy sheriff <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON>, 42, is principal owner and president of <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a leading options trading company, yet has never studied business or economics. `` You make more by paying more,'' <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> said in an interview during a trip to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The more you reward people, the more you're going to get back and the more you're going to make in the long run.'' <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> boasted that <ORGANIZATION> CRT </ORGANIZATION>, with around 600 employees, pays many of them twice the industry average. Eastern boss <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, on the other hand, has been locked in a cost-cutting battle with the airline's unions that precipitated the four-month-old strike. As a manager, <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> said he prefers to `` turn people loose'' rather than control them. <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON>, a conservative Republican, is the American partner in JV Dialogue, a U.S.-Soviet joint venture that sells personal computers in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He attributes its success to `` the human side of the equation.'' The people who command <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON>'s attention now are the 31,000 pilots, <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> and flight attendants who worked for Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> before their walkout that started March 4. Since early May, <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON>, in alliance with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s three unions, has been trying to buy the troubled carrier despite several stinging setbacks. <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> has offered $ 50 million and the unions have kicked in another $ 50 million as well as wage concessions totaling $ 210 million. In addition, the unions have pledged up to $ 175 million from their wages if certain goals are n't met during the first six months of operation under joint ownership. Like a modern-day <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Quixote </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> seems to be tilting at windmills. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, has increasingly gained momentum for his plan to rebuild <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> as a smaller carrier and sell $ 1.8 billion in assets to pay debts. The federal bankruptcy court in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> sought protection from creditors on March 9, has removed <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON>'s buyout plan from consideration, and <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has dismissed it as a `` joke''. Why does he go on? `` I think the people at Eastern understand why,'' <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> answered with a Buddha-like smile. `` They've really become like brothers and sisters to me.'' Besides, although the bankruptcy court proceedings have turned against him, <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> says he believes there's still hope from another quarter: <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Despite the impression he gives of farmboy `` Aw, shucks'' naivete, <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> is plugged into the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> power grid. He makes frequent trips to the capital, where he has attended meetings with <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He appears to have some reason, at least, to be hopeful. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republican Whip, recently wrote to <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> asking him to get involved in Eastern's bankruptcy case Some congressmen from both parties are concerned that the disappearance of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> as a major carrier could threaten airline competition _ already delicate because of the industry's consolidation since deregulation in 1978 That concern led the aviation subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to hold a hearing on Eastern on June 29, and it extends to some high-ranking members of the <ORGANIZATION> Bush </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, according to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> insiders. If the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> intervened in the case, it could bring at least a temporary halt to the sales of Eastern assets that the bankruptcy court has been approving, <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> said. When he talks about <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON>'s dark eyes flash, framed by his silver-white hair and trim mustache. Fresh off the Trump Shuttle from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, he rotated his thin, wiry frame in stretching exercises before sitting. <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> lives on a farm 55 miles west of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with wife <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> and their nine children, whose ages range from 1 to 23. Until now, he has mostly evaded the press, leaving phone calls unreturned and sprinting out of bankruptcy court hearings to a waiting limousine. His testimony at the congressional hearing on <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> was a rare public appearance; he has never given a press conference. `` My first impression was, ` This man's not for real,''' said a <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> associate, who asked not to be identified. `` I found him refreshingly naive.'' <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> says he first got the notion of engrossing himself in the Eastern saga when he read an article in <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> about the strike back in March. Some sources in the options market say <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON>'s company, <ORGANIZATION> CRT </ORGANIZATION>, has a reputation for honesty and efficiency. `` They're known as being very moral,'' said a stock options trader who requested anonymity. `` They want their employees to become rich, too,'' he added, noting <ORGANIZATION> CRT </ORGANIZATION>'s liberal profit-sharing policy. Candidates for jobs at <ORGANIZATION> CRT </ORGANIZATION> have to pass through an elaborate interviewing process involving encounters with as many as 15 people. After graduating <ORGANIZATION> Wheaton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with a bachelors degree in philosophy _ `` I hated school,'' he says _ <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> took the bus driving job in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. That was followed by a 1-year stint as a guard at the <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>, where he played chess with the inmates. He became deputy sheriff in 1973 in <LOCATION> Du </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Page </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, where sheriff <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Doria </PERSON> remembers him now as `` very quiet, obviously an intelligent kid.'' <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> then moved to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and started trading precious metals, returning to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in 1975 and starting <ORGANIZATION> CRT </ORGANIZATION> with a couple of partners in 1977. He is considered a math whiz who cracked the problem of Rubik's Cube in less than five minutes, and developed a basic mathematical formula for options trading that helped <ORGANIZATION> CRT </ORGANIZATION> mushroom into a leader in the field

<HEAD>Reagan's Judicial Legacy</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s imprint on the judiciary is far broader and deeper than his three <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appointments _ in eight years he named nearly half the judges now on the federal bench. His conservative legacy will extend well into the next century, ever more significant as the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> loosens the reins its decisions have imposed on lower courts. That's been the trend in such recent rulings as those weighing against abortion, curtailing affirmative action programs and permitting capital punishment of youthful and retarded murderers. In a study of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s judicial appointments, <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, a political scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION>, says they represent `` a major and what is likely to be an enduring legacy.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> named 346, or 47 percent, of the nation's active federal judges. <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, writing in the journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicature </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, says the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration set up the most systematic philosophical screening process in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history to check out candidates for judicial appointments. `` It demonstrated the importance given judicial selection by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, and the recognition that the appointment process, by placing on the bench those opposed to the creation of new rights by liberal activist courts, could be used to achieve the administration's social agenda,'' <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> says. That process was slow, gradually gaining headway during the latter years of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidency, and accelerating this year, after President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had succeeded him. <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> notes that because the lower courts must follow <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> precedent in their decisions, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appointees could not change course on issues such as abortion and affirmative action until the high court modified its stand on them. Now that is happening. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> named three new justices, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, and promoted <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> from associate to chief justice. While that consolidated a conservative majority, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appointees succeeded justices who were themselves centrist or relatively conservative. It may fall to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to appoint successors to the three oldest and most liberal justices, all of them over 80. `` I want people who will interpret the Constitution and not legislate from the bench,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said as a candidate. That was vintage <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, as was his warning against liberal activists on the bench. But as <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> observed, the high court `` has exercised its own brand of judicial activism'' in rulings to undo earlier decisions on civil rights and other issues. <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> says the real impact of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s appointments on district and appeals court decisions will be gradual, reaching into the 21st century, and likely to be reinforced by the judges <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chooses. Whether that's good or bad depends on the viewpoint of the person who is judging the trend. `` For civil libertarians this means that when the country celebrates the bicentennial of the ratification of the Bill of Rights in 1991, the courts will be dominated by those hostile to a liberal reading of those rights,'' <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> says. `` For judicial conservatives, this means a healthy return to government by the elected representatives of the people.'' In the conservative view, such contentious issues as abortion, civil rights and capital punishment belong in the hands of politicians, voters and legislators, rather than in the hands of judges with lifetime tenure. That's the line Justice <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> followed in his separate opinion on the abortion decision. He said the court should have overturned its original abortion rights decision and thus yielded its control `` of what I believe to be, and many of our citizens recognize to be, a political issue.'' <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> is unwavering in that view. A decade ago, as a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> law professor, he advanced the same argument on federal rule-making. `` The main problem is that the agencies have been assigned too many tasks requiring judgments that are of an essentially political nature and that ought to be made by our elected representatives,'' he said then. Not that elected representatives necessarily want to handle contentious, closely divided issues on which a vote gained may well mean a vote lost, too. By conservative reasoning, that's their problem.

<HEAD>Population Growth Still Outpaces Food Output in Sahel, Analyst Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It's an area in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> two-thirds the size of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, not counting <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. It's the Sahel, a region the `` Green Revolution'' forgot and is not likely to remember. The land is poor, the people are poor, and there are too many of them. The outlook is grim, says <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>. `` If the Sahel's population of 38 million keeps growing at its annual rate of 2.8 percent, it will double in about 25 years,'' he said. `` The land's carrying capacity _ its ability to provide food and fiber for humans and animals without losing long-term productivity _ has already been exceeded.'' If current population trends continue, along with current farming technologies, the population of the Sahel will exceed the land's carrying capacity by about 30 million people by the turn of the century, Day said Collectively, he said, the eight countries that make up the Sahel comprise the only region in the world where population growth has outpaced increases in food production over the last 20 years. The countries are <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gambia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Burkina </PERSON> <PERSON> Faso </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION>. Only 4 percent of the region is arable, or fit for crops. The balance is desert, 59 percent; permanent pasture, 26 percent; and woodlands, 11 percent. Per capita food production declined about 1.6 percent annually from 1962 to 1988 and is highly variable from year to year, Day writes in the July issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine. Gains in overall food output have come primarily from expanding crop plantings into marginal lands and by cropping traditional farm plots more intensively, he said. But the average yields of food crops have dropped the past 20 years. As soil degradation develops, land is turned into desert. It is this `` desertification'' process that has caused concerns in some other parts of the world, not only in the Sahel. Day outlined some of the steps that he thinks could be taken if the <LOCATION> Sahel </LOCATION> is to slow its downward spin and relieve some of the region's dependence on imports and food aid. `` Even during 1986 and 1987, when weather was better and domestic production was up, imports and food aid made up about 20 percent of the region's food supply,'' he said. Economic policies have stunted farmers' incentives to adopt new technology and have strongly affected production methods, Day said. For example, he said, <LOCATION> Sahelian </LOCATION> currencies are over-valued, which makes imports relatively cheap and exports expensive. And that encourages food imports and depresses farm prices. Urban wages are artificially high, and cheap food policies hamper production. Large-scale irrigation systems hold little promise in the Sahel, at least for the present, Day said. Eighty-five percent of the region gets less than 24 inches of rainfall annually. The Green Revolution technology dramatically boosted crop production in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and other parts of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, but not in the Sahel. Day said the Green Revolution's output growth was based largely on gains from high-yielding crop varieties, which are mostly effective when combined with ample water and chemical fertilizers. But water control, or irrigation, is largely absent in the Sahel. <PERSON> Sahelian </PERSON> farmers have generally rejected the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolution </ORGANIZATION> approach because the high-yielding varieties rarely outperform traditional crops there. `` Farmers have learned that applying fertilizers in semiarid regions lacking water control is very risky, with a high probability of economic loss,'' he said. Day said one of the questions is whether traditional production techniques can be modified to boost productivity and meet the Sahel's needs. Development specialists, he said, `` are not convinced that a low-resource approach by itself can achieve these objectives.'' Basically, that would involve animal and human labor in cropping systems that use manures and few purchased production `` inputs'' such as machines or fertilizer and other chemicals. Dryland farming techniques already used in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries could be adapted to the <LOCATION> Sahel </LOCATION>. `` Research shows that using moisture-conserving furrow-dikes and chemical fertilizers, for example, could raise the Sahel's food production and farm income 50 percent to 70 percent, and reduce soil erosion by as much as 70 percent,'' Day said. `` Farming will always be risky in the Sahel,'' he said. `` But more efforts to conserve soil and water could cut the risks.'' Day said `` efforts to encourage voluntary population control are important'' and could `` help bring the population into closer balance with the land's carrying capacity.'' <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Worldwatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a private, Washington-based research organization, has warned for many years of desertification, the abuse of farmland and forests, and the need for curbing population growth. `` Unfortunately, farmers alone can not brighten the world's food prospects,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said in his 1989 report, `` State of the World.'' `` Without the help of national leaders and family planners in slowing population growth, the hunger and malnutrition that has already engulfed large parts of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will deepen and spread.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> added: `` Population stabilization is the only acceptable goal in a world where growth in human numbers is leading to a life-threatening deterioration of environmental systems.''

 The choir is black at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catherine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sienna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, as are the eucharistic ministers and lectors, the altar boys and girls, even the hymnal. The priest, however, is white. But Father <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudloff </PERSON> has attended workshops on black preaching, and has learned to walk among the congregation while giving his sermon, to speak longer and louder, to make a few jokes and invite an occasional `` Amen!'' from his almost all-black congregation. `` Father <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> is a black white priest,'' insists <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, a member of the Queens parish for three decades. `` He's adapting the old ways to please us.'' <PERSON> Rudloff </PERSON> and flock epitomize a dilemma facing the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>: an expanding black laity and a dearth of black clergy. The case of the Rev. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> priest who was suspended after he formed his own church, has focused attention on racial tensions in the church and blacks' desire for new forms of worship. But what some call the `` black Mass'' is a fait accompli in urban dioceses, and most black Catholics say they're most concerned with the need for more black priests and lay leaders. <PERSON> Rudloff </PERSON> _ a popular priest who makes no apologies for his race _ sums up part of the problem this way: `` The black priests just are n't there.'' In the past five years the American church's black membership has doubled to 2 million, but there still are only 300 black priests _ roughly the same as 15 years ago _ and 600 black nuns and other religious. Less than 100 of the nation's 1,000 predominantly black parishes have a black pastor. The diocese of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> has around 150,000 black Catholics, more than any other American diocese, and more than a half dozen all-black parishes. But there are only two black pastors and only a few more black parish priests. At St. <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON>'s there still are no black deacons, although two are in training, and both the school and the religious education program are headed by white nuns. Black Catholics say that the paucity of black clergy and lay leaders is a reflection of the church's historic racism _ a racism to which several parishioners at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catherine </ORGANIZATION>'s can testify. <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>, a deaconate candidate, recalls life at a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> military boarding school in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> where blacks and whites sat on separate sides of the chapel. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> says that as a boy he was thrown out of a church in <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> by a white priest who thought he was going to steal something. And when he first came to <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON>'s in 1956, he says, a white couple would not rise to let him and his family get seats further down a pew. Such experiences led them to sympathize with <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> _ up to a point. `` If it's possible to be right and wrong, then Father <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> is right and wrong,'' says <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>, who helps distribute holy communion at morning Mass. `` There are problems in the church. But if you have a problem in your family, you do n't go out and start another family.'' On Wednesday the nation's black <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops struck a similar note, urging <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> to return to the church and fight racism from within it. The bishops said they hoped <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> and his followers `` are not commingling personal disappointment, individually felt frustrations and personal anger under the banner of racism.'' Racism, they said, `` is too serious an issue to be used as a cover for selfish concerns.'' Blacks at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catherine </ORGANIZATION>'s are proud of their contribution to the church, especially singing and preaching. `` The traditional Mass was so somber that by the time it was over you wanted to cry,'' says <PERSON> Millicent </PERSON> <PERSON> Modeste </PERSON>. `` But you should have joy in your soul at church. It should give you a lift for the rest of the day.'' `` The Bible says, ` Make a joyous noise,''' adds <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. The noisemakers have come to include <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Rydzewski </PERSON>, who first came to <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON>'s 35 years ago, when most parishioners were white like her. When the congregation takes up rocking Gospel hymns such as `` God Never Fails,'' `` you can hear her all over the church,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. The traditional Christian greeting of peace _ treated by many white <PERSON> Catholics </PERSON> as a perfunctory obligation _ `` resembles a mini-coffee break here,'' says <PERSON> Rudloff </PERSON>, who walks up and down the aisle, shaking hands. `` We have to cut it off so we can get on with Mass.'' At Our Lady of Charity in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, a black pastor has taken what he calls `` inculturization'' even further. There are drums as well as an organ, a statue of a black <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> over the altar, and prayers for the release of <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> from a South African jail. The Rev. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Seay </PERSON> wears a white African stole over his vestments. The church's biggest liability in developing more priests like <PERSON> Seay </PERSON> is its own history, including the use of slaves on Jesuit farms in the first half of the 19th century. The relatively progressive archdiocese of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> did not ordain its first black priest until 1947, and separate churches for black Catholics were common in large cities well into the 1950s. But in the 1960s the number of black Catholics increased 35 percent _ more than half the new members were converts _ and today immigration and the popularity of urban parochial schools continue to extend Catholicism among blacks. Although the priest population has remained stagnant, there are 13 black bishops, including Archbishop <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, compared to one in 1968. In 1987 the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> created a Secretariat for Black Catholics, and more than 50 similar offices have been set up in dioceses around the country. <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> is director of the secretariat. Black people have long memories, she says, and the church `` has a long history to overcome. We had to struggle just to sit in church, let alone minister.'' `` We suffer the sins of our fathers,'' says <PERSON> Seay </PERSON>. `` The church in earlier days refused to have an open door policy. Now we're paying for that.''

<HEAD>Natural Gas: Best Gasoline Substitute, Scientists Say</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also on financial wire.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Auto pollution, oil spills and growing dependence on foreigners for fuel have helped natural gas emerge as an energy solution that's literally lurking beneath our feet, scientists say The naturally occurring gas called methane, once considered useful mainly to heat and cook, is now widely viewed as the most realistic way to power cars and trucks into the 21st century because it is plentiful, safe and clean. There's such a vast supply underground that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> energy companies cap wells when the price gets too low for profitable sale. Petroleum-rich <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> squanders methane by burning the gas as it spurts from crude oil wells. `` The Saudis flare each day enough gas to fuel two-thirds of the road transport of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor <PERSON> Enoch </PERSON> <PERSON> Durbin </PERSON>, a leading proponent of the natural gas alternative. `` From a satellite, the brightest subject on earth you'd think would be <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. It's the Saudi fields.'' Natural-gas powered vehicles in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, part of an experimental fuel-alternative program <PERSON> Durbin </PERSON> helped create, have logged 500,000 miles without an overhaul because gaseous fuel does not cause the wear and tear of liquid fuel. Liquid fuels wash lubricants off walls of a car's engine, increasing friction and wear. The Canadian vehicles recently began rusting and falling apart. But the engines are in such good condition they are being sold for use in other vehicles, <PERSON> Durbin </PERSON> says. Despite its attractiveness, natural gas as a motor fuel has two big drawbacks. First, it takes up 1,000 times the space of equivalent gasoline and must therefore be compressed. Even then, it occupies more space than gasoline, so natural-gas powered vehicles need big tanks and frequent fillups. A car <PERSON> Durbin </PERSON> converted and supplied with two natural gas tanks could go only 200 miles without a refill, for example. The second obstacle is the lack of a nationwide refueling structure. `` If you're going to use it you have to be confined to a regular route where you can refill,'' says <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> German </PERSON>, senior vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> distributors and pipelines. German says the 30,000 cars in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> now running on natural gas are mainly fleet vehicles that travel regular routes. One remedy proposed is to equip vehicles with dual-fuel tanks, so if the natural gas runs out, the driver could switch to gasoline. But the extra tanks would take up passenger and cargo space. Where to store natural gas also is considered by some to be a problem. Unlike petroleum, natural gas needs a large, leakproof storage vault or it escapes into the atmosphere. Natural gas now flows to homes and businesses through about 1.2 million miles of underground metal pipe. So the system exists for getting gas from producers to service stations. What's needed, scientists say, are pumps at the stations to dispense the gas into vehicles. Ninety-three percent of the natural gas used in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is domestically produced and the rest comes from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Nearly half the crude oil consumed here, on the other hand, is foreign. About 80 percent of natural gas comes from underground gas reservoirs; the rest is found with oil. Some experts worry that greatly increased use of natural gas would deplete supplies and increase reliance on foreign energy suppliers, but others reject that fear. `` We have such huge methane reserves we do n't know how much we have,'' says <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Baddour </PERSON>, chemical engineering professor at <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think this fuel has a very bright future for you, your children and grandchildren.'' Moreover, it is renewable from unconventional sources such as putrifying garbage, sewage and animal waste, which theoretically could yield limitless supplies. <PERSON> Durbin </PERSON> recalls asking a geologist about the supply of natural gas. `` He said, ` What do you want to pay? At 60 cents per 1,000 cubic feet, there's none.' `` No one wants to drill a deep hole if it's cheap,'' <PERSON> Durbin </PERSON> says. `` If you tell me you're willing to pay $ 2 instead of 60 cents, I suddenly can drill a deep hole.'' The Department of Energy estimates proven reserves of natural gas in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> total 187.2 trillion cubic feet. By some reckonngs, that represents at least three centuries' worth of supply, even if all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vehicles burned natural gas instead of gasoline. Proven reserves of domestic crude oil, in comparison, are estimated at 27.3 billion barrels, or a 9 -LCB- - year supply at current consumption rates `` There is a tremendous amount of shut-in gas that is sitting there waiting for a market or for the price to go up, which is the same thing,'' says <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, an official of <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an oil and gas appraisal concern. About a half million cars are powered by natural gas worldwide, all backyard creations. No auto manufacturer makes a natural gas car, but that is changing. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, for example, is developing a plant to mass produce natural gas-powered vehicles by 1991. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the allure of natural gas has presented automakers with a Catch-22 problem. They are reluctant to build a natural-gas car, largely because the fuel is not yet widely available. Oil companies balk at producing large quantities until the vehicles gain acceptance. New clean air regulations, however, could spur them into action. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has set air quality standards for new buses in 1991 that no diesel engine can now meet. Similar rules for trucks take effect in 1994. While diesel engine manufacturers are designing prototypes that would burn substitute fuels, natural gas is at the top of the list. `` They've kept their options open but natural gas has very clean-burning fuel with no particulate matter, which is the biggest problem diesel users have,'' German says. `` So it makes sense to focus on natural gas over the others.'' Several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities are now experimenting with natural gas to power municipal vehicles, largely because fleet operators realize they could save money, German says. A gallon equivalent of natural gas costs about 40 cents vs. about $ 1.15 for regular unleaded. A taxi company in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> that spent $ 900,000 to convert 128 vehicles, for example, recovered the expense in a year via savings of $ 75,000 a month in fuel costs. Another big advantage of natural gas is that it emits mainly water and carbon dioxide when burned. `` You use natural gas at home without ventilating. You're cooking with it. You would n't think of using kerosene, gasoline or anything else without ventilation,'' says <PERSON> Durbin </PERSON>. Moreover, <PERSON> Durbin </PERSON> and others say, natural gas does n't ignite as easily as gasoline, so in a car crash it would dissipate harmlessly instead of exploding in a dangerous fireball. Other gasoline alternatives proposed by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Administration, including ethanol and methanol, are costlier, dirtier and would increase oil consumption because it takes more crude to make them, says <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> professor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, co-director of the school's energy laboratory. `` Some people who are proposing these changes have n't done their homework,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> says.

 A Japanese drug developed to fight cancerous tumors is startlingly effective in halting rejection of transplanted kidneys, say doctors in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> who are the first to test the compound on organ recipients. American researchers are just as impressed with 15-deoxyspergualin, also known as DSG, and expect to try it on transplant patients in a year or two. `` It's clearly very effective. Yet I think it's teaching us that there are ways to control the immune system we heretofore had not even thought possible,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, director of the laboratory for transplantation immunology at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Among the possibilities suggested by DSG research but yet to be proven outside the laboratory are lower doses of cyclosporine, a potent anti-rejection drug fraught with side effects; routine matching of organs regardless of blood type; and longer survival of animals getting organs from other species, a step toward the day when animal organs might be transplanted into humans. `` At the very least, if it allows us to lower the dose of cyclosporine, it might be useful,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Corry </PERSON>, chairman of surgery at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> and president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sharing </ORGANIZATION>. Transplant pioneer Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> is encouraged by the Japanese findings even though he halted animal tests several years ago because of the drug's toxicity and its intravenous use. `` In the big picture, over a long period of time, you ca n't give drugs intravenously so that's a limitation,'' but it could be useful `` as a kind of bail-out on a short-term basis to control rejection,'' <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON> said. `` To get 100 percent of graft survival, we must have several kinds of potent immune-suppressive drugs,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amemiya </PERSON>, head of surgical research at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cardiovascular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` This is one of that kind of potent drugs.'' There were 9,123 kidney transplants in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year, according to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sharing </ORGANIZATION>. Virtually all transplant recipients experience some organ rejection, but most is temporary, minor and can be controlled with drugs. Ninety-six percent of transplanted kidneys are functioning a year after surgery if the organs come from living relatives, said <PERSON> Kelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Straw </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> UNOS </ORGANIZATION>. The success rate is 91 percent when the kidneys come from dead strangers _ as is the case in the vast majority of transplants. DSG is a chemical byproduct of spergualin, a substance isolated by Japanese scientists in 1981 from bacteria found in soil. Two Japanese companies launched laboratory tests in 1985, and <PERSON> Amemiya </PERSON> and others began conducting the world's first clinical trials involving transplant patients last fall. <ORGANIZATION> Bristol-Myers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is under agreement with the Japanese firms to develop the synthetic drug for use in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> researchers have studied DSG as an anti-rejection agent in animals, but it has been tested on about 90 cancer patients over the past three years. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> is conducting clinical trials at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The human tests were begun after experiments showed DSG inhibited growth of tumors in mice, said Dr. <PERSON> Michaele </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, senior investigator in the <ORGANIZATION> NCI </ORGANIZATION>'s developmental chemotherapy section. `` It's hard to say whether the drug is going to be useful as an anti-cancer agent It's too early to tell.'' <PERSON> Amemiya </PERSON> reported at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surgeons </ORGANIZATION>' annual meeting in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> last month that 30 kidney recipients at six centers in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> were treated temporarily with DSG The 18 males and 12 females, ranging in age from 13 to 43, received their new kidneys as far back as 1975. The compound was administered after they suffered organ rejection. Standard anti-rejection drugs did n't work, including OKT3, which wipes out white blood cells called T-cells that attack transplanted organs, <PERSON> Amemiya </PERSON> said. The Food and Drug Administration approved OKT3 in 1987 for general use in kidney transplantation. It still is experimental in other types of transplants. Twenty-seven of the 34 episodes of organ rejection experienced by the Japanese patients were reversed within 10 days, according to <PERSON> Amemiya </PERSON>. Only one transplanted kidney was lost, with the patient forced back to dialysis. DSG worked best with the milder forms of rejection occurring within six months of transplantation, <PERSON> Amemiya </PERSON> said. `` We do n't have any good therapy for chronic rejection,'' which occurs one to five years later and is characterized by a narrowing of the transplanted organ's arteries. Side effects were temporary and included nausea and numbness around the mouth. Each of the 30 Japanese patients continued to receive cyclosporine and other immune-suppressive medications during the trial, <PERSON> Amemiya </PERSON> said. Cyclosporine, derived from a soil fungus, helps prevent rejection by freezing certain T-cells so they do n't divide and increase in number. But the daily oral doses can lead to kidney failure and high blood pressure. DSG allows certain T-cells to divide normally but for some reason the cells do not attack transplanted tissue, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said. Transplanted organs also can be attacked by antibodies the recipient's body produces in response to foreign tissue. Transplanting organs across blood types or from one species to another generates even more of these antibodies. Cyclosporine and other anti-rejection drugs prevent the antibodies from forming, provided the medication is given as soon as an organ is transplanted. Treatment must continue throughout the patient's life. While DSG can not reduce antibodies already in the blood, there is evidence it can suppress production of more _ possibly explaining its ability to prolong survival of animals receiving organs from other types of animals, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said. In experiments at <LOCATION> Stanford </LOCATION>, transplanted hearts in mice were rejected within 11 days when no medication was given and within a month if cyclosporine was given daily. When mice got DSG for several weeks right after transplants, their new hearts functioned for several months after treatment ceased. `` The paramount and striking attribute of DSG to me is its ability to educate the immune system to accept the graft for a very long period,'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said. `` This means that patient may not have to take this drug forever.''

<TEXT>
 A fungus that may have been released into the environment 79 years ago has killed off many gypsy moth caterpillars in three Northeast states and could lead to a weapon against the devastating insects. Entomologists wo n't know until they do a gypsy moth egg count in the fall if the fungus blocked or just delayed an outbreak, but it has spared thousands of trees from defoliation in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Scientists also do n't know whether the fungus flourished only because of this year's unusually cool, wet spring and will subside. `` I think this is probably something we may never see again,'' said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> entomologist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McManus </PERSON>. Nonetheless, federal and state entomologists are growing the fungus to ascertain its species and ensure that samples are preserved. The gypsy moth, a European import, escaped from a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> researcher in 1882 as he tried to cross it with a silkworm to make stronger silk. The moth has spread slowly, reaching <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> in great numbers and farther west in small pockets. It feeds mostly on the leaves of oak and other hardwood trees, and in a major infestation in 1980-81 caterpillars stripped more than 12 million acres in the East _ including over half <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION>'s 3 million acres. Generally, the caterpillars work in a cycle, with light defoliation in the first year increasing in the second and third years. Severe defoliation over several years will slow the growth of a tree, and in some cases kill it. Nearly a quarter-million acres in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> were sprayed this year _ the first year of a cycle _ with insecticide. Other states also sprayed, mostly in urban and suburban areas. <PERSON> Dimilin </PERSON>, a pesticide that inhibits the growth and development of the caterpillars, is most commonly used. Researchers are also working on products to limit the damage of the moth while minimizing damage to the rest of the environment. <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> scientists have created a virus-based pesticide, called `` Gypchek,'' that destroys many of the insects and drastically affects their ability to reproduce. But it has not been perfected and a reasonably priced and practical commercial product is probably at least two years away. Scientists are also experimenting with a protozoa native to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that weakens gypsy moths and leaves them more vulunerable to diseases. From 1905 to 1911, researchers imported 127 species of the moth's natural enemies from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but only eight have survived In 1910 and 1911, researchers released a small amount of a Japanese fungus in suburban <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>; it infected only a small percentage of the caterpillars in the target aread, but the research was conducted under unfavorable weather conditions. Entomologists at the <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> Agriculture Experiment Station here excitedly announced in June that a fungus, and not a virus that periodically attacks gypsy moths, had killed many leaf-eating larvae in the three states, and a recent report indicates it may be at work in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. The fungus spores land on the caterpillars and produce enzymes that eat through the skin. Inside, the fungus grows, killing the caterpillar. `` Quite possibly this is the same thing and this has been spreading slowly and gone undetected or never had an opportunity to express itself until this year,'' said entomologist <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreadis </PERSON> at the Experiment Station. Scientists have conducted two very limited releases of the Japanese fungus in recent years, at the <LOCATION> Allegany </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1985 and <LOCATION> Shenandoah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> in 1986. In both cases, there was only very limited transmission of the fungus from infected caterpillars to native larvae, said <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Hajek </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> entomologist in <LOCATION> Ithaca </LOCATION>. But neither was a good test. A virus attacked the gypsy moths in the 1985 exeriment, and a drought hampered the research the following year. The fungus release has tightly controlled; federal regulations put it `` in the same bag as genetically engineered micororganisms,'' <PERSON> Hajek </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McManus </PERSON> questioned if the fungus could be successfully used as a biological weapon because there would have to be enough moisture for it to survive. <PERSON> Andreadis </PERSON> said that if the fungus at work in the Northeast is the Japanese strain, regulators should allow its use as a biological control.

 It may seem unromantic to stamp out the twinkling of the stars, but astronomer <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Durrance </PERSON> does n't think so. `` In order to study them, about their mysteries, we have to be able to see them better,'' <PERSON> Durrance </PERSON> said. `` We're trying to see their true beauty.'' <PERSON> Durrance </PERSON> leads a <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> team working on adaptive optics technology, which uses mirrors, sensors and computers to reduce the atmospheric distortion that makes stars seem to dance. `` Much like lying at the bottom of a pool and looking at an object being dangled above you the water distorts the image of what you see quite severely. ... The twinkling is not an aspect of the stars but an aspect of the atmosphere.'' Scientists at other institutions are developing similar instruments. By making it easier to examine material around stars, they may bring astronomers closer to an elusive goal _ discovering planets outside our solar system. Scientists theorize that material left after a star has formed falls into a stable orbit around it and coalesces over millions of years into planets. The <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> instrument wo n't allow astronomers to directly see possible planets, but could let them measure changes in the brightness around a star, possible evidence of planets, said researcher <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Clampin </PERSON>. The instrument, an adaptive optics coronagraph, uses two mirrors, sensors and a high-speed computer to manipulate light waves entering a telescope. One mirror is a thin membrane whose contours can be changed as often as 100 times a second to compensate for the motion of a star's image. The other, called a flat mirror, wobbles 100 times a second to eliminate the distortion of light rays as they strike the telescope lens. Only the flat mirror was tested during observations in May of Beta Pictoris, a star 312 trillion miles away, at an observatory in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Campanas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. The entire system is expected to be ready in about two years. A complete system already is in use at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Optical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astronomy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatories </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>. Astronomer <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goad </PERSON> said it is one of two started in anticipation of the next generation of ground-based telescopes The new telescopes, which will be about eight meters in diameter instead of the customary two to five meters, will need help correcting distortions in the larger amount of light they can gather. Goad said adaptive optics devices are considered experimental at this point because nobody except their creators can figure out how to operate them. Astronomers at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> also have an experimental system in the works. And a related development at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> is the invention of laser-generated artificial stars. An artificial star can provide the `` guide star'' scientists need to calibrate adaptive optics equipment properly, said electrical engineer <PERSON> Chet </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>. Artificial stars, formed with a yellow-orange laser beam that illuminates a spot in a layer of sodium particles about 60 miles high, can compensate for the usual lack of a bright object in the sky near the object under study. ` In order to do this de-twinkling, one needs a very bright object or a reference point that is very bright ... so you can deform the mirror to correct the distortion,'' <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said. `` This star works just as well as an actual star that may be millions of miles away.'' The Hopkins instrument was designed in part to get a better look at an unusual disk around Beta Pictoris, which was detected several years ago by its infrared emissions, <PERSON> Clampin </PERSON> said. It is too soon to know what the observations in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> will yield. Images of the Beta Pictoris disk, containing matter that could be planets or material that will form planets, are being enhanced. `` It's hard to predict revolutions,'' <PERSON> Durrance </PERSON> said. `` It's certainly going to have an impact, and I think it will have a major impact when we can eliminate the effects of the distortion.

<HEAD>Researchers Advance Bone Research With Computer Image Scanner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A computerized X-ray scanner developed to find defects in auto parts is giving medical researchers better glimpses of bone structure than conventional analysis methods can, and in less time. `` This new technology is allowing us to better understand the consequences of bone changes caused by disease or age,'' such as osteoporosis, said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>'s orthopedic research lab. The microcomputer tomography scanner, or MicroCT, was developed in 1981 by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to find structural flaws in ceramic car parts. It yields three-dimensional images, which <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> is using to study trabecular bone _ a porous, spongy, shock-absorbing structure found near joints. Osteoporosis and other bone diseases affect trabecular bone first, and more extremely, than other bone. Osteoporosis, a common ailment among the elderly, occurs when bones become porous, brittle and slower to heal. By studying how trabecular bone changes during the course of the disease, <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> hopes to learn how to control the weakening. The MicroCT, in 15 minutes, takes 129 two-dimensional X-rays of a small bone sample from several angles. The data is fed to a computer that creates a three-dimensional image in less than three hours. The computerized bone reconstruction is faster than microscopic analysis, yields more details and lets researchers examine inner bone structure without having to slice up the specimen, he said. However, the MicroCT can not be used on living patients, and is only used on bone specimens because it would burn soft tissue.

<HEAD>Compact Disc Holds Huge Quantity of Computer Data</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new computerized compact disc with the capacity of 1,350 floppy diskettes may mean affordable access to data once reserved only for those with mainframe computers and sizeable budgets, researchers say. FEDSTAT, the Compact Disc-Read Only Memory -LRB- CD-ROM -RRB- and the technology that makes it work are a venture of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> JVC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Virginia-based online data service. FEDSTAT contains some of the most widely used <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> demographic and economic data. On the single disc are statistics about each city and county in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ information about population, business and the economy. While some of the information has been available in printed form, some had been accessible only through magnetic tape processed by a mainframe computer. `` Never before has this much government data been available in an inexpensive, easily used format,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, dean of the graduate school of library service and director of the project for the university. The county business patterns files alone take up about 2 -LCB- feet of shelf space on paper, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Statistics President <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Glimpse </PERSON>. The capacity ca n't be measured only in terms of its volume as found in other sources; `` this is a new approach to data,'' he said. `` The capacity to cross-tabulate, to create new data, is infinite with FEDSTAT.'' The disc contains 484 million characters. Retailing at $ 195, it is used on a CD-ROM player attached to a personal computer. The player costs about $ 500. Data range from population figures as specific as the number of children under 5 for any county in the nation to annual economic data by county for the past 20 years. Users also can prepare county maps selecting from thousands of subjects; compare counties, metropolitan areas, states, the nation and other countries; and develop forecasts based on historical data. The first orders for FEDSTAT have come from such organizations as the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Turner predicted that within two years, CD-ROM technology will be available at most university libraries, larger public libraries and 15 to 20 percent of school libraries. A new version of the first FEDSTAT disc will be produced each year, <PERSON> Glimpse </PERSON> said, with partial updates issued on additional discs throughout the year.

<BYLINE>Commodities Markets Provide Outlet For Wild Financial Speculation</BYLINE>
<HEAD>With PM-Soybean Corner, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Commodities exchanges give speculators the opportunity to bet millions of dollars on the future prices of such goods as soybeans, gold, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills and frozen orange juice. The purpose of the futures exchanges is to transfer the risk of price fluctuations from people who do n't want the risk _ such as farmers or metals processors _ to speculators who are willing to gamble on making big profits. Futures contracts are agreements to deliver a quantity of goods at a specified price at a certain time in the future. Options, which also are widely traded on the exchanges, give purchasers the right but not the obligation to buy or sell something at a certain price within a specified period. Commodities traders, standing in recessed `` pits'' and dressed in brightly colored jackets, shout orders and wave hand signals to each other in a free - for-all auction of contracts In a typical transaction on a commodities exchange, a farmer who wants to lock in a guaranteed price for his crop to minimize risk will promise to deliver 20,000 bushels of soybeans at a specified future date at a specified price. Assuming the price rises, the speculator who buys the contract could later take the beans from the farmer and resell them to someone else at the higher prevailing market price, pocketing the profit. But if the price drops, the speculator would lose money by having to pay the farmer the agreed-upon price and then resell the soybeans at the lower market price. Speculators rarely end up actually holding with mountains of tin or pork bellies because they sell their positions at a profit or loss before the delivery date. The ultimate buyer is a customer who actually needs the commodity. Although the exchanges began with agricultural products, they have rapidly expanded into financial products. For example, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> does most of its business in contracts based on the value of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 100-stock and 500-stock indexes.

<HEAD>European Commission Unveils New Draft Company Statute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has unveiled a new draft European company statute aimed at easing business in the future single European market. The new draft, announced Wednesday, is a watered-down version of the initial proposal, which <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> had strongly opposed. <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bangemann </PERSON> said, however, the statute aims to ensure that workers will be involved in corporate decision-making, although this had raised <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s main objection. `` There will be no European company without a definition of the place of workers in it, and in which way they participate in decisions,'' <PERSON> Bangemann </PERSON> said. The proposal, which has to be approved by the 12 member countries of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, gives companies the choice of creating a European company, <ORGANIZATION> Bangemann </ORGANIZATION> said, without forcing them to and without replacing national company statutes. Companies could create a European company through a merger, a holding company or a common subsidiary, provided that at least two of them have their headquarters in different member countries, <PERSON> Bangemann </PERSON> explained. The new proposal lowers the minimum capital of a European company to 100,000 European currency units, or around $ 110,000, to allow small and medium-sized companies to choose the new European statute. The draft also contains tax incentives by allowing companies to offset losses in one member country against profits in another, although <PERSON> Bangemann </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> did not want the provision to be reserved only for companies choosing a European statute. The provisions on employee participation would allow <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> countries, rather than companies, to choose which model to adopt. This is a change from an earlier proposal which gave companies the choice. The Commission, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s executive body, is offering three options: appointing workers to supervisory boards following the West German example; workers' committees as used in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>; or other models chosen in consultation with the companies concerned. <PERSON> Bangemann </PERSON> said member countries could allow companies to choose between the three models or limit the choice to one model. He said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, for example, could limit the choice to the first option to remain in line with West German law.

Possible hurdles could include the reluctance of institutional shareholders to accept the group's all-debt offer for the tobacco-retailing giant, scrutiny by the British government and defensive litigation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, experts said. `` An important element is how the government is going to react,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Healey </PERSON>, editor of the British publication Aquisitions Monthly. `` Is it good for the <LOCATION> U.K. </LOCATION> industry? What benefits will come out of it besides making three rich men richer?'' BAT stock fell the equivalent of 37 cents a share to close at $ 14.21 Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, following a $ 3.24-a-share runup Tuesday. The stock remained above the Goldsmith group's offer of $ 13.77 a share in debt securities, indicating speculation that a higher offer might emerge. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depositary </ORGANIZATION> Receipts representing shares of BAT closed at $ 14.12 -LCB-, down from $ 14.37 -LCB- Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. A sweeter offer may rival the record $ 25 billion purchase of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, completed earlier this year by the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. BAT's board of directors met Wednesday and afterward reaffirmed in a statement that it regarded the offer as unwelcome. The Anglo-French financier <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>, joined by British merchant banker <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON> and Australian entrepreneur <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>, launched the bid Tuesday morning through a newly formed company, <ORGANIZATION> Hoylake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. The group said it intended to break up BAT _ the world's biggest tobacco company _ by selling its non-tobacco interests, which include financial services, retailing and papermaking. Analysts said the bidders could encounter trouble winning over British institutional investors, who have been hostile toward highly leveraged offers, or those relying on debt rather than cash or stock. The bid would require a better price and some cash to succeed, analysts said, adding they believed <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>'s offer was only an opening shot. The takeover also may face an investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> Monopolies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on public interest grounds. Although Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Conservative government champions free-market policies, it has blocked takeovers in the past. The government, for example, in March blocked the acquisition of brewer Scottish and <ORGANIZATION> Newcastle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> by the Australian company <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IXL </ORGANIZATION>, citing the public interest. For the same reason, the government last year ordered <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> to more than halve its 22 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. PLC <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> subsequently bought the entire holding. The offer for BAT also might face legal action in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where BAT has extensive interests, including <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Williamson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>'s department stores. Earlier this year, South African-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>'s hostile bid for the British mining giant <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> ran aground in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> court. A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> federal judge, citing antitrust concerns, issued a temporary restraining order against that bid, which then expired under British takeover rules. Gold Fields since has agreed to be taken over by British conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Hanson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. There was some speculation that BAT's management might try a leveraged buyout, but analysts said the obvious choices for engineers for such a big deal have their hands quite full. In a leveraged buyout, a bidder uses borrowed money to take over a target and then uses the target's earnings or sells off its pieces to pay off the debt. <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON>, the acknowledged leveraged buyout king, is still dealing with <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Wasserstein </PERSON> <PERSON> Perella </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, another <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> buyout firm, is involved in an offer for <ORGANIZATION> Gateway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a British supermarket operator.

 Investors bid <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s stock higher as they continued to speculate about how a <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> judge might rule on the three-way battle for the media giant. Time rose $ 1.87 -LCB- to close at $ 148.12 -LCB- a share Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as Wall Street waited for Chancery Court Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s verdict on <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s request for an injunction against <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 14 billion tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> was expected to rule by week's end, before he leaves for a vacation and before Time's $ 70-a-share offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> expires at midnight After <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> heard arguments in the case Tuesday, investor pessimism about the chances for success of <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 12.2 billion, $ 200-a-share bid for Time sent <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s stock tumbling $ 6.37 -LCB- a share to $ 146.25. Analysts said that at under $ 150 a share, the stock attracted bargain hunters Wednesday. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Anschel </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the market continued to speculate on the outcome of the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> court case. If the judge decides in favor of Time, the company plans to allow its tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> to expire as scheduled Monday even if <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> appeals to the <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Adler </PERSON>, a Time spokesman, said Wednesday he did not immediately know whether <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> would extend the tender offer if the judge ruled in favor of Paramount. It also was not known what Paramount planned to do if <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> denied its request. Paramount stock was up 50 cents to $ 58.50 a share on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday, while <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> stock fell 37 -LCB- cents to $ 62.50 a share. In arguments Tuesday, attorneys for Paramount and some of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s shareholders contended that <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s directors violated their duty in refusing to let shareholders vote on <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s bid The lawyers claimed the Time board effectively put the company up for sale when it agreed to a stock-swap merger with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> in March. Under <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> law, if a company is up for sale, its board must entertain any bids that would fetch the most money for shareholders. Time attorneys dismissed that argument, saying the merger was simply a business transaction that followed two years of negotiations. Time announced the tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> after <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> launched its bid.

<TEXT>
 Baseball All-Star <PERSON> Bo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> shows he can handle a tennis racket, leap above a basketball rim and run like the wind in a new commercial, but he slid through the hockey scenes in his socks. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> put his multiple athletic talents on display in the ad for shoemaker <ORGANIZATION> Nike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which aired for the first time in Tuesday night's television broadcast of the All-Star Game. The 60-second spot opens with shots of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who plays both baseball and football professionally, hitting a baseball and eluding would-be tacklers. `` Bo knows baseball,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> star <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> in the commercial. `` Bo knows football,'' adds <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rams </ORGANIZATION> quarterback <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON>. Pro basketball star <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, runner <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Benoit </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuelson </PERSON>, a professional women's cycling team and a group of bodybuilders also attest to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s grasp of those sports between clips of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in action. Even <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McEnroe </PERSON> manages to say `` Bo knows tennis,'' although it sounds more like a question than a declaration. But after <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is shown delivering a devastating check and manuevering past several hockey players, <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kings </ORGANIZATION> star <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gretzky </PERSON> smiles in delivering his one-word assessment: `` No.'' <ORGANIZATION> Nike </ORGANIZATION> advertising director <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedbury </PERSON> said Wednesday the hockey scenes with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> actually were shot in a gymnasium in <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Nike </ORGANIZATION> admakers caught up with the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royals </ORGANIZATION> outfielder last spring. <PERSON> Bedbury </PERSON> said the actors were in their socks for the scene, not on skates. `` We did n't think it was worth the risk'' to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to ask him to perform that scene on ice, where he might risk an injury, <PERSON> Bedbury </PERSON> said. The commercial ends with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> trying to play a guitar on stage along with another famous <PERSON> Bo </PERSON> _ musician <PERSON> Bo </PERSON> <PERSON> Diddley </PERSON>, who composed and performed the music in the ad. As <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> struggles to make some sweet sounds from his guitar, <PERSON> Diddley </PERSON> points a finger at him and snaps: `` Bo, you do n't know <PERSON> Diddley </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s baseball, soccer, cycling and running scenes also were shot in <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION>, along with scenes to appear in an international version of the ad that features <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> playing soccer and cricket. <PERSON> Bedbury </PERSON> said instructors who showed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> some of the nuances of cricket were amazed at how far he hit the cricket ball. Other scenes for the ad were shot in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Riswold </PERSON>, a copywriter and associate creative director at <ORGANIZATION> Nike </ORGANIZATION>'s ad agency, <ORGANIZATION> Wieden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, said the idea for the commercial developed over a few beers one February night. <ORGANIZATION> Nike </ORGANIZATION> marketing director <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> told the group they had to come up with something new featuring <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who had appeared in three commercials by himself last year on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Nike </ORGANIZATION>'s line of cross-training shoes _ athletic shoes suitable for several sports. `` We got off on a discussion of the other <PERSON> Bo </PERSON>'s we have all heard of _ <PERSON> Bo </PERSON> <PERSON> Derek </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Beau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brummels </LOCATION>. Somebody mentioned <PERSON> Bo </PERSON> <PERSON> Diddley </PERSON> and we thought that might be interesting,'' <PERSON> Riswold </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Riswold </PERSON> said that with the Jackson-Diddley matchup in mind, he and art director <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> had no problem developing a rough outline of the entire commercial the next morning. <ORGANIZATION> Nike </ORGANIZATION> declined to say how much <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Diddley </PERSON> or any of the other athletes received for appearing in the commercials. But <PERSON> Bedbury </PERSON> said all of the athletes except the bodybuilders already had contracts of some sort with <ORGANIZATION> Nike </ORGANIZATION> that call for personal appearances each year. The bodybuilders were recruited off a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles-area </LOCATION> beach, he said. <PERSON> Riswold </PERSON> said he did n't think any of the professionals hesitated about appearing in an ad starring someone else. `` I think they enjoyed it. They were being set up as the experts in their fields,'' he said. The full 60-second version of the ad is expected to run through August, when 30-second versions will begin and run through winter.

 The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION>, operator of the nation's largest electric power system, said it will refinance $ 6.5 billion in debt to the federal <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> by issuing bonds in the public market for the first time in 15 years.

<HEAD>House Approves Expansion of Protected Coastal Areas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An effort to sharply limit oil drilling off the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> coast, spurred by the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> disaster, is headed to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> with a strong voice of approval from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. The House on Wednesday approved the most extensive ban on offshore oil leasing of the decade, widely expanding prohibitions for one year against drilling off large portions of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> coasts. `` Those people who have allied themselves with the oil industry understand how dramatic a statement this is now,'' Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., said before the vote The one-year moratorium was part of the $ 11 billion <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> appropriation bill, which was approved 374-49. There was no separate vote on the oil leasing provision. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has not voted on the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> appropriation and several senators plan to introduce similar prohibitions. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration opposes the expanded prohibitions. Under the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill, leases for offshore oil drilling would be banned in areas off the coasts of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, a stretch of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> between <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and, for the first time, off part of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s coast. The appropriations bill sets spending by the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and related agencies for fiscal 1990, and the provision prohibits appropriated money from being used to lease or approve oil drilling or exploration in the areas during the year. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and other legislators are seeking to permanently ban drilling in some areas of the outer continental shelf. `` This moratorium will provide needed breathing room to enact the stronger safeguard I have proposed of a 10-year moratorium,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Courter </PERSON>, R-N.J. Support for limits on offshore oil exploration has grown since the March disaster in which the tanker Exxon Valdez spilled 1.6 million gallons of oil into the pristine Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> water off the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> coast. Smaller tanker accidents over one weekend last month spilled oil into water off the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> coasts. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the major industry trade group, called the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote `` a tragedy for our nation.'' `` In an emotional reaction to tanker oil spills, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has taken an action that will inevitably boomerang,'' the institute said in a statement. `` Tanker traffic bringing imported oil into <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> waters will have to increase as domestic oil production continues to decline.'' In a June 29 letter to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations leaders, administration budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said the oil leasing provision and the bill's total budget, which is $ 2.45 billion more than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> requested, are the main reasons the White House opposes the bill. The administration also objects to a `` buy <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' provision that requires offshore oil and gas rigs to be constructed with at least 50 percent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> labor and materials.

<HEAD>Northwest Airlines Pilots Threaten Preparatory Strike Action</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAGAN, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The union representing <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> pilots says it will ask a federal mediator to call an impasse in talks with the airline, paving the way for a possible strike, if substantial progress in talks is n't made by Friday. `` Twenty-eight months in negotiations is probably long enough to conclude a contract,'' pilot spokesman <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON> of the 5,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. `` We are getting the feeling that management is stringing us along and trying to make this last as long as possible,'' <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON> said. But <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> denied the allegation. `` The goal is to get a contract, not string anybody along,'' <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> said. `` As along as both sides are talking we can move toward an agreement.'' The union's harsh talk came after the pilots and <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> negotiators met Wednesday for the second time this week. Northwest and the union have tentatively settled hundreds of issues in the the past two months but are still at odds over the hard issues _ wages, job security, work rules and insurance. Former Republic Airlines pilots and original <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> pilots are still working under separate agreements even though the two airlines combined operations nearly three years ago. `` The result is that our membership becomes increasingly frustrated,'' <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON> said. `` They want a showdown with management.'' Under federal labor law, only the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> can declare an impasse in airline negotiations. If the board declares an impasse, a 30-day cooling-off period begins. After the end of the cooling-off period, the union is free to strike and the company can implement its final offer. <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON> said if substantial movement does n't occur in the negotiations, the union strike committee will ask the union's master executive councils to obtain airport permits for informational picketing.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Calloway </PERSON> said Thursday his firm needs to resort to guerrilla tactics to make an appreciable dent in <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION>'s share of the Japanese soft drink market <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> dominates <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s cola market with a 92 percent share, compared with <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>'s 6 percent, according to food and beverage industry statistics. `` When you have as strong a share as <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION>, that calls for guerrilla warfare,'' <PERSON> Calloway </PERSON> said. That means `` chipping away at the convenience store chains, store by store, vending machine by vending machine,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> also owns the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION>, Pizza Hut and <ORGANIZATION> Taco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> restaurant chains, and the snack food company Frito Lay. <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cola </ORGANIZATION> has been successful in other countries, such as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, where it has 21 bottling plants and contracts for 20 more. But gaining market share in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> `` is trench warfare, store by store, pizza by pizza. It's that kind of business,'' <PERSON> Calloway </PERSON> told reporters over a hotel-catered lunch of consomme <PERSON> Mille </PERSON> <PERSON> Fanti </PERSON> and filet steak au poivre. <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> was a sponsor for the worldwide tour of pop superstar <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who performed in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in 1987 and 1988. Those visits boosted <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cola </ORGANIZATION> sales in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> briefly to 12-15 percent of the cola market, but they fell back each time. `` <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> says <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is its most profitable market,'' <PERSON> Calloway </PERSON> said. `` That says you're up against a pretty formidable force.'' He said problems remain with brand recognition and the complex Japanese distribution system. `` We're not going to go out and do something crazy,'' he said. `` There is no silver bullet, no bomb we can drop.'' But he said <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> would keep up steady efforts at market penetration, including increasing local retail outlets and investing in vending machines. <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> also is expanding into non-carbonated drinks such as fruit juices, sports drinks and coffee, <PERSON> Calloway </PERSON> said. `` We're not the market leader so we ca n't afford to do a lot of advertising and marketing. We have to do it in a controlled manner. If I went out and matched <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION>'s spending here, unless you have the distributors and the vendors, it wo n't help.'' <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION>'s other ventures in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> have fared better. <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION>, a joint venture with the trading giant <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, has cornered 98 percent of this country's fried chicken market, according to <PERSON> Shinsuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Ohkawara </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>, who accompanied <PERSON> Calloway </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION> has 834 outlets in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the largest Western-style restaurant chain in this country, and projected sales of $ 863 million this year, <PERSON> Ohkawara </PERSON> said. By the end of the year <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> will have 18,000 restaurants worldwide, the largest restaurant chain in the world, and directly own or operate 40 percent of them, with the rest franchises or joint ventures, <PERSON> Calloway </PERSON> said. By contrast, the McDonald's fast-food chain has some 11,000 outlets worldwide, with 20 percent of them directly operated, he said.

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s unemployment rate fell to a seasonally adjusted 6.3 percent in June from 6.4 percent in May, the government said Thursday.

 Homeowners seeking to take advantage of falling interest rates this summer should be able to refinance their mortgages faster and more cheaply under a new program offered by the nation's largest mortgage buyer. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> Fannie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday the changes would offer lower closing costs and speedier approval to homeowners replacing fixed - or adjustable-rate mortgages with new fixed-rate loans `` What we're trying to do here is grease the skids and make it easier for people to refinance,'' said economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berson </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Fannie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION>, a congressionally-chartered, shareholder-owned company that provides money for home buyers by purchasing mortgages from lenders and packaging them into securities for sale to investors. Lenders are anticipating a surge in refinancing this summer because fixed-rate mortgages have fallen by about 1 \ percentage points since March and are expected to fall by another quarter of a point by fall Fixed rates are below 10 percent for the first time in more than a year. One-year adjustable rates have edged down in recent months, but not by as much, and still are about a percentage point higher than a year ago. <PERSON> Berson </PERSON> said he expected roughly 300,000 homeowners to refinance in the July-September quarter. He said about $ 90 billion in fixed-rate mortgages would be written in the quarter and between 25 percent to 35 percent of those likely would be refinancings. <ORGANIZATION> Fannie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION> helps finance one of every eight mortgages. Much of this summer's refinancing activity will come from homeowners who took out discounted, adjustable-rate mortgages and are now facing higher payments. For instance, home buyers who took out an adjustable-rate mortgage at a 7 -LCB- percent rate in 1987 are probably now paying 11 -LCB- percent. That would, on average, increase their monthly principal and interest payments on a $ 100,000 mortgage from $ 699 two years ago to $ 990 now. Refinancing to a fixed-rate mortgage at 9 -RCB- percent would lower the payment to $ 859. During the last refinancing boom in 1986 and 1987, homeowners often had to wait three months before getting approval for their new loans, <PERSON> Berson </PERSON> said. The waiting period has dropped to about six weeks and the company's new program could shorten the process by another week or two, he said. With certain restrictions, <ORGANIZATION> Fannie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION> will waive a new home appraisal, saving homeowners several hundred dollars. In that case, the new loan must come from the original mortgage lender. However, the waiver will not apply if the current loan is backed by the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Also, <ORGANIZATION> Fannie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION> for many loans will not require borrowers to go through another credit and income check. Those loans must be for a one - or two-family main residence or a second home The new mortgage must not exceed 90 percent of the home's value, or 95 percent with mortgage insurance. Homeowners will not be allowed to take more than 1 percent of the new loan in cash. They will be permitted to borrow the money to pay for the closing fees of the new loan, thus eliminating most up-front costs.

<HEAD>Midway Expansion May Open Jobs For Striking Eastern Workers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An expansion of <ORGANIZATION> Midway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which is trying to acquire jets, routes and gates from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, may provide jobs for strike-weary workers, the chairman of the Chicago-based carrier said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinson </PERSON>, Midway chairman and chief executive officer, said Wednesday the carrier should sign a $ 206.5 million agreement next week for 16 Eastern planes, two Canadian routes and 13 gates at <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, which Midway plans to develop into its East Coast hub. By the mid-1990s, <PERSON> Hinson </PERSON> said Midway hopes to have more than 1,000 employees in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and operate routes from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. `` The former <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> workers are high-quality professionals that we would give top priority to hire under the appropriate circumstances,'' said <PERSON> Hinson </PERSON> in a visit to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, where Midway operates its principal maintenance facilities. Midway has hired nine former <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots since machinists, pilots and flight attendants at the Miami-based airline went on strike March 4. The Midway deal is part of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s strategy to significantly downsize operations from its pre-strike level of more than 1,000 flights. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> must approve the agreement. Eastern, which filed for bankruptcy protection March 9, has already sold its profitable Northeast Shuttle to billionaire <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> for $ 365 million and has announced plans to sell at least 20 more jets. While Eastern considers relocating its headquarters to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hinson </PERSON> said Midway's expansion plans could more than double flights into <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. If the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> deal is approved, Midway may have up to five flights a day to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Hinson </PERSON>. The airline, which acquired bankrupt <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> as it expanded to a national carrier during the past decade, also holds several of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>'s former Latin American and <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> routes, which <PERSON> Hinson </PERSON> said may be used after the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> hub is established. Midway currently flies via <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> service would put Midway in direct competition with <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>, the Northeast's largest carrier, which first sought <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> gates and routes. `` <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> is a formidable competitor and we have our work cut out for us to move into their territory,'' <PERSON> Hinson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hinson </PERSON>, who predicted more airline bankruptcies before the industry settles, said the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> expansion will be steady but not overly aggressive. `` We're generally a conservative company,'' said <PERSON> Hinson </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> co-pilot. `` We are not out to roll the dice.'' Often dubbed `` the darling of deregulation,'' Midway was the first carrier chartered after government control of the industry ended in 1979 and began as a small <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> carrier catering to full-fare business travelers. By the early 1980s, it was losing more than $ 20 million annually and began courting regular passengers soon after acquiring <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> in late 1984. Midway operates more than 220 regular and commuter flights to 51 cities from <LOCATION> Midway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> south of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The carrier inaugurated <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> service this spring and made a $ 900 million order for 37 jets from <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> with an option for 37 more. For the first quarter, Midway reported record earnings of $ 2.9 million, but profits have been erratic in recent years, dropping more than 40 percent last year. On Wednesday, Midway announced a tentative labor agreement with the Teamsters, representing more than 450 mechanics, stock clerks and aircraft cleaners.

 <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> plans to begin producing popular Cabbage Patch Kids dolls immediately now that it has completed the purchase of most product lines from financially troubled <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the company says. <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest toymaker, completed its purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>'s major assets on Wednesday for $ 85 million cash and an option for <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> to purchase 1 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> at $ 28.85 after its bankruptcy plan was confirmed, said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Alperin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president. <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> closed at $ 20 on the American Exchange Wednesday, down 25 cents. The Pawtucket-based company said it had reached agreement with Original Appalachian Artworks, owner and creator of <ORGANIZATION> Cabbage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kids </ORGANIZATION>, to begin manufacturing the dolls immediately, in time to advertise them for Christmas. The dolls would be made overseas and packaged at <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> division in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Longmeadow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alperin </PERSON> said. Most of <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>'s other lines, including Scrabble, Parcheesi, Perfection and Aggravation, also would be produced in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> ... has the capacity there and they've handled things like this before,'' <PERSON> Alperin </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> also bought the right to use <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>'s name and would discontinue some of its products, including <PERSON> Alf </PERSON> and Wrinkles, <PERSON> Alperin </PERSON> said. Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassenfeld </PERSON> said the acquisition would add `` some time-tested products which will enrich <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION>'s three divisions without material additions to our cost structure.'' <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION>'s third division is <PERSON> Playskool </PERSON>. `` We will be putting on some people to handle Cabbage Patch, but we're talking tens or twentys,'' <PERSON> Alperin </PERSON> said. `` These are short term decisions and we'll deal with this on a long term basis as we get into it.'' <PERSON> Alperin </PERSON> said the Cabbage Patch line, which was the largest selling toy of all time in 1985, `` has not had the attention it deserved over the past couple of years.'' Sales of Cabbage Patch peaked at more than $ 600 million in 1985, compared with $ 58 million last year. But the transaction's success does not rest solely on Cabbage Patch products, <PERSON> Alperin </PERSON> said. Some of the board games, for example, `` are tried and true names in the games field,'' he said. <PERSON> Alperin </PERSON> would not release internal figures estimating projected revenues for the new products. <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> is far from <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION>'s most ambitious purchase. It aqcuired <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> in 1984 for more than $ 350 million, <PERSON> Alperin </PERSON> said. The Connecticut-based <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act a year ago, citing debts of $ 540.3 million.

During her tenure, the number of contracts traded on the exchange jumped from 5 million in 1984 to 34 million in 1988. In addition, the exchange also added contracts for crude, heating oil and gasoline options as well as a propane futures contract. R.P. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, currently executive vice president, will continue his role as senior exchange official, the statement said.

 The stock market declined slightly today, pausing after Wednesday's rise to new post-crash highs. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 2.66 to 2,529.97 in the first half hour of trading. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 6 to 5 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 425 up, 504 down and 539 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 23.86 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. Analysts said traders had grown leery of chasing after stocks following the market's latest rally, which produced gains in each of the first seven sessions of July. Wall Streeters were looking ahead to several economic reports due from the government on Friday, including monthly statistics on industrial production and the producer price index of finished goods. The figures are expected to provide further confirmation that economic growth is slowing, fulfilling a primary goal of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s credit policy. Investors will give especially close scrutiny to the report on producer prices which, if it lives up to its advance billing, will show a slackening of inflationary pressures. Losers among the blue chips included <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION>, down \ at 114 -LCB-; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, down -LRB- at 54 \; <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION>, down -LRB- at 47 -RCB-, and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>, down -LRB- at 36 -RRB- The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks dropped .22 to 183.93. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index was down .40 at 366.78. On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 18.02 to 2,532.63, surpassing its previous post-crash peak of 2,531.87 on June 23.

<HEAD>Five Companies in Running for Soviet Space Ads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Five <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies are vying to place ads costing more than $ 1 million on the side of a Soviet space shuttle scheduled for launch next month, according to a company with exclusive rights to sell the advertising. San Francisco-based Soviet-Pacific Enterprises would only identify the five as a major oil company, a television network, an international courier, a consumer-goods produce and a food company. The ads, printed on thin plastic-like film stuck on the spaceship with an adhesive, will disintegrate within 45 seconds of launch because of the heat generated as the craft cuts through the earth's atmosphere Talks with the five companies are now in the final stages, said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, marketing director for Soviet-Pacific. `` But we're looking for just one sponsor,'' he said. <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON> said his company does n't want the space ship to `` look like an <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> 500 race car with 500 different advertisements.'' For a payment estimated at more than $ 1 million, the company that is picked will be allowed to place two 10-by-21-foot signs on the side of the Soyuz shuttle, scheduled for launch Aug. 30. It also can display its corporate logo or advertisements around the Baikonur launch site and send a camera crew to film the August lift-off. The Soviet space agency, Glavkosmos, and <PERSON> Licensintorg </PERSON>, the commercial-space and licensing agency in the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION>, have imposed only one restriction, said <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON>. They wo n't allow sponsorship by liquor or tobacco companies. More than 100 million people in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are expected to view a live broadcast of the blastoff, presenting an ideal opportunity to a company that wants to introduce a new product in that nation. Less than 45 seconds might seem short for a million dollars, but a company spokesman pointed out that a 60-second spot during a Super Bowl broadcast costs more than that. Glavkosmos has signed commerical agreements with several Western companies. In March, a Japanese televison network paid the agency $ 12 million for the right to send a correspondent into space in 1991. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which administers the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space program, does not accept advertising or payment from private citizens for flights. In the past, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space shuttles have carried some projects for a fee, but that practice was canceled after the Challenger explosion in 1986 that killed seven astronauts.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> commission </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it had cleared a film distribution venture by three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies after they agreed to amend their pact to comply with <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> antitrust rules. The commission said that the agreement between <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> to create a joint venture, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>, to distribute their films in the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> had contained exclusivity clauses which restricted competition. These clauses were changed so that the venture now only has the right of first refusal on the parent companies' films. This means that if <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> chooses not to distribute a film, the parent company could distribute it on its own or through a third party. The companies also agreed to maintain `` appropriate records'' and to establish an arbitration procedure to solve problems such as film allocation and access to screen space, the commission said. The commission's clearance lasts for five years, after which it will review the companies' agreement. It said the changes to the agreement were designed to ensure that the parent companies remained autonomous and that the films were distributed as widely as possible.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plans to lay off more than 550 workers nationwide by next spring, the company says. An <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> pet food plant that employs 390 people will be closed by next spring, and 170 management workers nationwide will be laid off in the next few weeks, <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement Wednesday. The management layoffs will trim 42 employees from <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> headquarters The rest of the cuts will be among sales, manufacturing and distribution workers in the company's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grocery products division, said spokesman <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Botrell </PERSON>. The layoffs were announced to employees Wednesday, <PERSON> Botrell </PERSON> said. The company said in a statement that the plant in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, which produces Ken-L-Ration and Puss-N-Boots dog and cat foods, will be closed in phases between the end of this year and next spring `` It's always difficult to make these types of decisions when it affects loyal and dedicated employees,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Smithburg </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. `` But for competitive reasons, we felt it necessary to take these steps.'' <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> said the actions would force the company to take a one-time charge of $ 104 million, or 80 cents per share. A change in accounting methods for grocery products inventories will force another 20 - to 25-cent-per-share charge Those charges, coupled with a $ 21 million, 20-cent-per-share loss by the European pet foods group mean the company will take losses of more than $ 1.20 per share in the fiscal year ended June 30. The company said the plant closing was due to declining popularity of semi-moist and canned pet foods made in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>. The products will continue to be made at plants in <LOCATION> Kankakee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kan </PERSON>. The company also announced that <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marineau </PERSON> had been appointed to the post of executive vice president for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grocery products. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> will take <PERSON> Marineau </PERSON>'s old position as executive vice president for international grocery products.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has put the brakes on the proposed $ 1.05 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> by a French-government controlled oil and chemical concern, the companies said. In a joint release Wednesday, the companies said the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> had postponed a decision about the deal until antitrust concerns were resolved. Neither Pennwalt nor the French company, <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquitaine </ORGANIZATION>, would elaborate on the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> concerns. `` We are concerned in that we want to go ahead with the transaction as soon as we are allowed to,'' said <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Elf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aquitaine </LOCATION> spokesman. `` I do n't think it's unusual, and you ca n't always expect the government to agree with you We are taking all reasonable efforts to get the situation cleared up.'' <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ticknor </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said she could neither confirm nor deny any investigation of the deal. However, she said that in general, companies often give the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> more time to review a proposed deal _ especially when they feel the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> decision could be negative. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Pattison </PERSON>, a chemical industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Cyrus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grenfel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said Wednesday the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> was worried the merger would make the company too strong in the flourocarbon business. `` From what I've heard, the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> is worried that a merger would make Elf No. 3 in the world in flourocarbons, next to <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> and Allied,'' he said. `` They are concerned that the entire market would be in the hands of three giants.'' <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> stock tumbled Wednesday with news of the delay, trading as low as $ 118.50 and closing on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> at $ 124, down 25 cents from Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Elf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquitaine </ORGANIZATION>'s offer is worth $ 132 a share. In their statement, the companies said the postponement was to `` permit <LOCATION> Elf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aquitaine </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> to pursue discussion with the staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> concering the possibility of entering into an agreement which would address certain concerns raised by the staff with respect to the proposed transaction.'' <LOCATION> Elf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aquitaine </LOCATION> also announced it had extended to 5 p.m. July 21 the expiration date on its takeover offer for <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> stock. The offer has been extended regularly since the companies agreed to merge on March 20. The management of the 139-year-old, Philadelphia-based pharmaceutical company agreed in the spring to merge with <LOCATION> Elf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aquitaine </LOCATION> after rebuffing offers from Centaur Partners of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> today reported a 14 percent increase in its second-quarter profit, partly reflecting good returns from investments in its soft drink operations, bottling joint ventures and marketing. <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> said its after-tax income came to $ 345.5 million, or 98 cents a share, in 1989's second quarter, up from $ 303.1 million, or 82 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. Revenue for the latest quarter rose 5 percent to $ 2.4 billion from $ 2.3 billion. International shipments of concentrate and syrup continued to grow at a greater rate than domestic shipments, <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> reported. Concentrate and syrup shipments outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> advanced 15 percent for the quarter, compared to 3 percent at home. The biggest jump was in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, for which the company credited successful marketing activities in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and continued infrastructure development combined with the increased affordability of Coca-Cola products in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the company said, growth was led by the continued momentum of its diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> and caffeine-free diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> brands. `` Our investment in bottling joint ventures, soft drink infrastructure, and marketing continue to provide substantial worldwide volume, market share and profit gains,'' <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goizueta </PERSON> said in a news release. `` These investments produce consistently attractive returns and support our expectations for strong bottom-line performance for the remainder of the year,'' <PERSON> Goizueta </PERSON> said. For the first half of the year, <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>'s income was $ 605.3 million, or $ 1.70 a share, which was a 17.9 percent increase over $ 513.6 million, or $ 1.39 a share, in the first six months of 1988. Revenue rose 5.5 percent to $ 4.4 billion in the first half from $ 4.2 billion a year earlier.

 The stock market was little changed today, pausing after Wednesday's rise to new post-crash highs. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up 2.27 to 2,534.90 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street. Gainers and losers were evenly balanced in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 581 up, 584 down and 547 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 54.08 million shares at mdimorning. Analysts said traders had grown leery of chasing after stocks following the market's latest rally, which produced gains in each of the first seven sessions of July. Wall Streeters were looking ahead to several economic reports due from the government on Friday, including monthly statistics on industrial production and the producer price index of finished goods. The figures are expected to provide further confirmation that economic growth is slowing, fulfilling a primary goal of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s credit policy. Investors will give especially close scrutiny to the report on producer prices which, if it lives up to its advance billing, will show a slackening of inflationary pressures. Among actively traded blue chips, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> rose \ to 115; Union Carbide gained -RRB- to 27 -LCB-, and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> was unchanged at 36 -LCB-. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks rose .06 to 184.21.

<HEAD>EEC Slaps Provisional Anti-dumping Duties On Asian Compact Disc Players</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Thursday imposed provisional anti-dumping duties on imports of compact disc players from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> because they may threaten the survival of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> industry. The duties, which range from 6.4 percent to 33.9 percent, hit major Japanese consumer electronics companies including <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sanyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Matsushita </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Major South Korean companies affected include <ORGANIZATION> Goldstar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Samsung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION> The duties, which take effect next week but must be ratified by the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> within three months, followed a two-year investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> after it received a complaint by the main <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> producers of compact disc players. These are NV Philips of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Olufsen of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Grundig </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. In a statement, the commission said that the CD player imports `` seriously held back the development of the Community industry, the main inventor and the major developer of the product.'' It added that most of the Japanese and all of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> companies involved `` adopted marketing and pricing policies in clear violation'' of international trading rules on dumping, or selling at below market price. The commission calculates whether dumping occurs by comparing the price on the exporter's domestic market with the price charged in the 12-nation trade bloc. The commission said that it found CD player dumping `` margins'' of between 1.54 percent and 45.54 percent in the case of the Japanese exports and of between 20.1 percent and 32.5 percent for the Korean exports. It said that the low prices of the imports caused `` an important price depression'' which resulted in `` severe'' losses for <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> producers, which lost about 30 percent of their annual revenue. The EEC inquiry covered the period June 1, 1986 to May 31, 1987, although sales of the players started in 1984. The commission did not give a total value of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> market for CD players although it said that the imports in 1987, which made up about two-thirds of the market, were valued at 300 million European currency units, or about $ 33 million. Imports surged 23-fold to about 2.3 million units in 1987 from 97,924 units in 1984 of which more than 90 percent came from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. This compared with a fivefold increase in <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> producers' sales, the commission said. It did not give figures for sales by <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> producers. The market share of Japanese and South Korean exporters rose to more than 75 percent in 1987 from just under 50 percent in 1984, while the share of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> industry fell from more than 50 percent to 18 percent in 1987, the commission said. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> investigated 14 producers of CD players but imposed duties on 11 of them. The duties on the companies are as follows: <ORGANIZATION> Matsushita </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 33.9 percent; <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 28.8 percent; <ORGANIZATION> Sanyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 27.8 percent; <ORGANIZATION> Yamaha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 23.7 percent; <ORGANIZATION> Victor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> -LRB- JVC -RRB-, 20.9 percent; <ORGANIZATION> Kenwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 19.3 percent; <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 17.5 percent; <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 15.9 percent; <ORGANIZATION> Onkyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 8.5 percent; <ORGANIZATION> Funai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 8.4 percent; <ORGANIZATION> Teac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 6.4 percent. Duties also were imposed on four South Korean companies: <ORGANIZATION> Inkel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 20.1 percent; <ORGANIZATION> Goldstar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 32.5 percent; <ORGANIZATION> Samsung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 23 percent and <ORGANIZATION> Haitai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 21.3 percent. An official, who asked not to be named, at <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belgium </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NV </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>'s Belgian subsidiary, said that <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> was not so concerned by the duties because its factory in <LOCATION> Colmar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> had been producing between 75 percent and 80 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>'s CD players for the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> market since 1988. He said that the factory was not established to avoid paying duties but was in line with <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>'s policy of making products in the company's local markets. <ORGANIZATION> NV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION> was unavailable for comment.

<HEAD>Crop Report Sends Soybeans Up, Wheat Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soybean futures prices rose in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to a bullish government crop report while wheat futures fell and corn futures were mixed. The soybean market's strongest gains were in the new-crop contracts, for late summer and autumn delivery, following an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report that indicated farmers planted fewer soybeans than the market had expected. Slight gains were posted in the July soybean contract, which is under heavy pressure due to an exchange order requiring traders to reduce their holdings. The unusual order was seen as a move to block one player's attempt to corner the market. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> report, released Wednesday afternoon, pegged planted corn acreage at a higher-than-expected level and also showed higher-than-expected winter wheat production. In early trading, wheat was -LCB- cent to 2 \ cents lower with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.86 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 1 -RCB- cents lower to 1 \ cents higher with July at $ 2.57 a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent to 2 cents higher with July at $ 1.44 \ a bushel; soybeans were -LCB- cent to 8 -LCB- cents higher with July up -LCB- cent at $ 6.87 a bushel and August up 8 -LCB- cents at $ 6.73 Livestock and meat futures were higher, with cattle futures up sharply in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .20 cent to .95 cent higher with August at 71.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to 1.05 cents higher with August at 82.70 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent to .68 cent higher with July at 47.20 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .20 cent to .55 cent higher with July at 29.30 cents a pound. Cattle futures settled higher on Wednesday while pork futures were mixed.

 Violence flared anew on mining picket lines today with the president of a <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> coal company hospitalized after being hit in the face with a rock. Miners in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> were arrested by the vanload for blocking a bridge. The incidents came one day after the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union extended a contractually allowed three-day work stoppage for two more days. `` There is a total state of chaos. This state is out of control,'' said <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Herdon </PERSON>, spokeswoman for an <ORGANIZATION> A.T. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary in <LOCATION> Beckley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION> The UMW went on strike against <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on April 5 and wildcat pickets began demonstrations on June 12. By the time the work stoppage began Monday, at least 37,000 miners were off the job in eight states. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> state police went on `` Stage 4'' alert today, meaning troopers were put on round-the-clock duty and had days off canceled. Col. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckalew </PERSON>, state police superintendent, said he issued the alert `` to have the manpower available should it be needed'' during the stoppage. All 486 troopers were placed on alert. <PERSON> Herndon </PERSON> said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Snavely </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> A.T. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massey </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> Sidney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Pike </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, was hospitalized this morning after he was hit in the face with a rock. More than 200 pickets blocked the entrance to <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Coal </PERSON>, throwing rocks at cars, state police said. They said one injury was reported but they had no details. There were no immediate arrests. In <LOCATION> Prenter </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, about 400 <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> members and supporters blocked a road leading to non-union <ORGANIZATION> Elk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Run </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> today, saying they would not move until arrested More than 30 miners had been arrested before noon, said state police spokesman <PERSON> Ric </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. `` We're arresting them literally by the vanload,'' he said. The protesters are upset with what they say is the constant traffic by coal trucks over <LOCATION> Sand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, which they say has a 12-ton weight limit. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>, a laid-off miner who lives near the bridge, said the empty coal trucks weigh up to 19 tons, and when loaded weigh 70 to 80 tons. Also today, officials at <ORGANIZATION> Hampden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gilbert </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said five of their trucks and a guardhouse at its mine were fired upon Wednesday and a fire was started at the mine gate In other violence Wednesday, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> police said up to six shots were fired at a coal-loading operation where union miners were harassing non-union haulers. One shot struck a coal truck but no injuries were reported, officers said. Near Matewan, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, six drivers were injured when roving bands of pickets attacked two convoys hauling coal to a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> A.T. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the Herald-Dispatch of <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, A state police dispatcher told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> no one authorized to comment was available. The union said it extended its sanctioned work stoppage to give <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> an opportunity to respond to Gov. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>' request to resume negotiations under federal mediation. But the announcement had little impact at a run-down recreation area dubbed Camp Solidarity in <LOCATION> Carterton </LOCATION>, a mining town in southwest Wildcat strikers who have been coming here in shifts of several hundred from <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> who said they have no plans to end their walkouts. `` We're going to continue to show our support until some kind of settlement is reached,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Frankfort </LOCATION>, Ill. In <LOCATION> Beckley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallanan </PERSON> granted an injunction requested by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> prohibiting violence and threats by miners that have been on strike against the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beckley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> since January Police on Tuesday escorted replacement workers from a company mine after strikers reportedly threatened to close it by force. State police Sgt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said troopers made 17 arrests in <LOCATION> Carterton </LOCATION>. They included a nun who had stopped her medical van in front of a community center on a highway to deliver medicine, union officials said. Sister <PERSON> Bernadette </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON>, who was wearing a camouflage kerchief, was charged with impeding traffic and contempt of court. A federal judge's order forbids the union to impede coal traffic. She was later released on bond. Miss <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> said that while she supports the union, she never intended to hinder traffic. `` I think it's very ironic that <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> is let out of jail to do community service and I'm arrested for doing community service,'' she said, referring to the former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide.

The new plant is part of an arrangement in which <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> will take a 20-percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Rover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, the British carmaker with which it has had joint ventures over the last 10 years. <PERSON> Rover </PERSON> said it will acquire 20 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>'s manufacturing operation in <LOCATION> Swindon </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> and other Japanese carmakers have expressed an interest in expanding in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> ahead of 1992 when the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> becomes a barrier-free market. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement brings the total investment commitments in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> by the three major Japanese car companies to 1.8 billion pounds, or $ 2.9 billion. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the new plant is to begin manufacturing at the end of 1991, `` with a limited volume of <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> cars,'' which will substitute for imports from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on the European market. `` One year later, a full range of production operations will start with output rising rapidly to 100,000 cars -LRB- per year -RRB- in 1994,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. He said this will include cars built for the <ORGANIZATION> Rover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, with which <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> has had various joint ventures for 10 years. Rover will continue to build cars for <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> at its plant in <LOCATION> Longbridge </LOCATION>, northwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Rover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said the deal with <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> `` will help both companies, while preserving their separate identities, to develop long-term strategies to meet the demands of an increasingly global market.'' <ORGANIZATION> Rover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> is owned by <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, which bought the former state-owned carmaker from the government in July 1988. Young called <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement a `` vote of confidence'' in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and said it signaled a `` renaissance of the <LOCATION> U.K. </LOCATION> motor industry.''

 <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cellular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is discussing sweetening its $ 5.4 billion cash offer for <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> shares that it does not already own by including stock that would boost the offer to $ 6.2 billion. In a joint statement, the companies said they are in continuing negotiations over a proposal under which each share of <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> stock would be exchanged for cash and stock having an aggregate value of $ 127.50 a share. The cash portion of the deal would come to at least $ 110 a share, the statement read, with McCaw Class A stock making up the remainder of the offer. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>'s latest offer for LIN was for $ 110 a share in cash. The companies cautioned in the statement that `` there can be no assurances that the negotiations will result in an agreement.'' They said the transaction under discussion would not be completed before Nov. 1 and would preclude <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION>'s previously-announced spinoff of its television stations. If the <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, Wash.-based <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION>'s takeover attempt is successful, it would result in the largest cellular telephone market in the country. The announcement came a day after <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> disclosed in a filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> had `` recommenced negotiations through their advisers.'' <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> of <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> <PERSON> MacGregor </PERSON>, <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>'s outside public investor relations counsel in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said Wednesday's conversation between <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> and LIN financial advisers was a resumption of talks that occurred last weekend <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> had launched a bid of $ 120 a share for LIN in June, but LIN rejected it as inadequate. LIN has about 53.9 million shares on a fully diluted basis, and <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> already owns about 5 million, or 9.8 percent, of those shares. On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> lowered its bid to $ 110 per share, citing a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> court settlement that was unfavorable to LIN. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> recently denied <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION>'s claims to certain cellular interests of <ORGANIZATION> Metromedia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> markets. The new offer reduced the value of its bid for shares it does not already own to about $ 5.36 billion, from $ 5.8 billion.

 The stock market hovered in a narrow range today, pausing after Wednesday's rise to new post-crash highs. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 92.57 points over the past seven sessions, rose another 2.08 to 2,534.71 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Losers slightly outnumbered gainers in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 673 up, 717 down and 517 unchanged. Analysts said traders had grown leery of chasing after stocks following the market's latest rally, which produced gains in each of the first seven trading days in July. Wall Streeters were looking ahead to several economic reports due from the government on Friday, including monthly statistics on industrial production and the producer price index of finished goods. The figures are expected to provide further confirmation that economic growth is slowing, fulfilling a primary goal of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s credit policy. Investors will give especially close scrutiny to the report on producer prices which, if it lives up to its advance billing, will show a slackening of inflationary pressures. <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> tumbled 6 -LCB- to 18 -LRB-.

<HEAD>Raul Gardini Makes Italian Grain Company Worldwide Power</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The late <PERSON> Serafino </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferruzzi </PERSON> made his fortune helping to feed starving postwar <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. His son-in-law, <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardini </PERSON>, has wider ambitions and they are having repercussions on one of the world's busiest commodities markets. <PERSON> Gardini </PERSON>'s company, <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finanziara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION>, was at the center of attention this week as the reported target of an emergency order by the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> to break up an alleged attempt to corner the soybean market. The company denied it had done anything wrong and protested the order _ which required liquidation of large positions in the market's July soybean contract _ saying it was only trying to satisfy its export commitments. Since taking over the Ravenna-based company nine years ago, <PERSON> Gardini </PERSON> has turned the <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> food group into <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s biggest grain exporter and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s second largest private-sector industrial concern after <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> If <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnelli </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> auto empire, is <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s industrial king, then the handsome, silver-haired <PERSON> Gardini </PERSON> may be the crown prince But while <PERSON> Agnelli </PERSON> was born into wealth, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s financial press frequently reminds <PERSON> Gardini </PERSON> of his middle-class farming origins and his rough-and-tumble boardroom style. While <PERSON> Agnelli </PERSON>, who holds a law degree, is reverently referred to as the `` Avvocato'' -LRB- lawyer -RRB- <PERSON> Gardini </PERSON> has been nicknamed `` Il Contadino'' -LRB- the peasant -RRB-. <PERSON> Gardini </PERSON> has made a number of bold moves since he became head of the <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. The most important was his 1987 takeover of the <ORGANIZATION> Montedison </ORGANIZATION> chemical company, a move that consolidated <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION>'s power as <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s second-largest private business group. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s financial press takes pride in describing <PERSON> Gardini </PERSON> as one of the new breed of enterpreneurs who look beyond <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s borders and are not afraid of a corporate fight. The 56-year-old <PERSON> Gardini </PERSON>, an avid outdoorsman and hunter who owns a 500-year-old palace on <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>'s Grand Canal, is equally proud of his roots as a farmer. He was born in <LOCATION> Ravenna </LOCATION>, attended an agricultural school and went to work for <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION>. In 1957, he married <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION>'s daughter, <PERSON> Ida </PERSON>. Since becoming chairman in 1980, <PERSON> Gardini </PERSON> launched a major expansion and the group now owns some 2.5 million acres of land distributed over three continents. Perhaps his boldest move was his raid on <ORGANIZATION> Montedison </ORGANIZATION>, one of the 10 largest chemical companies in the world but saddled with debt and aging plants that were accused of being some of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s worst polluters. The Italian newsweekly <PERSON> L'Espresso </PERSON> headlined the <ORGANIZATION> Montedison </ORGANIZATION> takeover `` the great blitz,'' and published a photograph of <PERSON> Gardini </PERSON> in his hunting attire, gripping a shotgun with a cigarette dangling from his mouth. <PERSON> Gardini </PERSON> has been accused of riding roughshod over the interests of minority shareholders. A controversial restructuring of the <ORGANIZATION> Montedison </ORGANIZATION> group in 1988 caused a stir among investors, pushing the <ORGANIZATION> Milan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> into a tailspin. To foreign critics, he said, `` This is an Italian operation in the Italian market and if investors do n't like it they can leave.'' Among his moves was the ouster of <ORGANIZATION> Montedison </ORGANIZATION> chairman, <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Schimberni </PERSON>, who had encouraged <PERSON> Gardini </PERSON> to buy into <ORGANIZATION> Montedison </ORGANIZATION>. Schimberni now heads the Italian state railroad. <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finanziara </ORGANIZATION> ranked 28th in Fortune 500 magazine's recently released list of the largest industrial corporations outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with 1988 group sales of $ 18.3 billion <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> was eighth, with sales of $ 34 billion. Since taking control of <ORGANIZATION> Montedison </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> has been seeking to wed the agricultural and chemical industries. The Group recently announced plans to produce and market a biodegradable plastic made from corn starch.

 Sales of the Big Three automakers' cars and light trucks rose 8.9 percent in early July compared with last year when incentives had been rolled back and sales fell from a torrid June rate, the companies said Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said they sold vehicles at an average daily rate of 33,504 during the July 1-10 period this year compared with a rate of 30,766 during the same time last year. Car sales were up 10.3 percent and truck sales were 6.8 percent higher. The sales rate during June last year was particularly strong, even for what proved to be the second-best sales year in auto history. But the incentives that spurred those deals began coming off in early July 1988. This year, incentives are available, but they are n't catching as many consumers' eyes. In fact, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> this week boosted customer and dealer incentives in an effort to shrink swollen inventories of 1989 cars as the model year enters its last three months. While the sales news for the early July period was good, it brought the automakers' sales so far this year only a little closer to last year's pace. Through July 10 this year, the Big Three had sold 5.9 percent fewer cars and trucks this year than last year, falling to a daily rate of 35,308 vehicles from 37,524 last year. Car sales were off 7.8 percent for the year and light truck sales were down 2.6 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> was the only one of the Big Three to post a car sales decline during early July, as sales dropped to a daily rate of 2,921 this year, 5.8 percent lower than the 3,100 daily rate a year ago. For the calendar year, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales were down 14.6 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s trucks sold at a rate 1.6 percent higher in early July this year than they did a year ago. For the year, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s truck sales were down 0.7 percent. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> posted an 11.3 percent gain in car sales, going to a daily rate of 10,615 during early July this year compared with a rate of 9,534 during the same time last year. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales for the year were down 9 percent from last year's level. The company's truck sales ran 13.2 percent ahead of last year's pace in early July but were down 2.8 percent for the entire year <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> posted the heftiest gain in car sales, rising to a daily rate of 6,923 during early July this year, up 16.9 percent from the 5,919 car-a-day rate during the same time last year. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales so far this year were running 2.5 percent behind last year's pace On the truck side, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> dealers were selling 3.6 percent more vehicles in early July this year over last year, but 3.8 percent fewer so far during the year.

<TEXT>
 Consumer products giant <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> will acquire the Faberge and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Arden </PERSON> lines of toiletries, cosmetics and fragrances for $ 1.55 billion, salvaging a deal that had been abandoned in April, it was announced Thursday. A definitive contract between <PERSON> Faberge </PERSON>'s owner, <ORGANIZATION> Riklis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the holding company for <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> operations, has been signed and the transaction is expected to be completed within 30 days. <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Riklis </PERSON> had reached an agreement in principle on the takeover back in February and intended to negotiate details of a final contract within 3 months but the talks broke down. In late April, <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> said it was dropping its plan to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Faberge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and its independent subsidiary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Arden </PERSON> because <PERSON> Meshulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Riklis </PERSON>' <PERSON> Riklis </PERSON> group was demanding changes in the tentative agreement that would have raised the price. In a joint news release Thursday, the companies said their differences have been resolved. Completion of the transaction is subject to a number of technical conditions that the companies did not specify. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION>, described the conditions as minor matters that wo n't jeopardize the deal. `` They are fully confident this deal is going to happen,'' <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> said. The signed contract resembles the arrangements made in February. `` We are delighted that negotiations were resumed and that they have resulted in a transaction in line with the original terms,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Angus </PERSON>. `` Faberge will be an excellent fit with <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION>'s existing personal products operations and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Arden </PERSON> furthers our ambition to be strongly represented in the important prestige skin-care, color cosmetics and fragrance sectors,'' he said. Under the contract, <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> is to buy all of Faberge except for the <ORGANIZATION> McGregor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apparel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which comprises clothing lines such as Botany 500, Wonderknit and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> the Kid. <PERSON> Faberge </PERSON>, bought by the <PERSON> Riklis </PERSON> group in 1984 for about $ 180 million, is a well known manufacturer of personal care products, including hair sprays, shampoos, deodorants and fragrances. Among Faberge's brand names are Aqua Net and Brut. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Arden </PERSON> makes an assortment of premium skin care products, perfumes and makeups marketed under the names <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Arden </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Lagerfeld </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fendi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chloe </PERSON>. New York-based <PERSON> Riklis </PERSON>, whose other holdings include <ORGANIZATION> Samsonite </ORGANIZATION> luggage and <ORGANIZATION> Culligan </ORGANIZATION> water softeners, acquired <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Arden </PERSON> from the drug maker <ORGANIZATION> Eli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for about $ 700 million in late 1987. Combined sales of Faberge and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Arden </PERSON> amounted to more than $ 800 million in the year ended January 1989 and profit was $ 93 million. <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION>, with dual headquarters in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, is among the world's major consumer products companies and had worldwide sales of $ 31 billion in 1988. Its products in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> range from soaps and laundry detergents to packaged foods. Through acquisitions and internal growth, <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> for several years has been building its personal products operations around the world. It has concentrated its attention on several segments of the market, among them the prestige end of the fragrance and beauty aid business. Two years ago, <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> bought <ORGANIZATION> Chesebrough-Pond </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 3.1 billion, thereby acquiring many widely known personal-care products and several prestige, or expensive, lines such as the Prince <PERSON> Matchabelli </PERSON> fragrance collection. <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> also owns <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s Passion scents. Just last month, <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> agreed to acquire the European cosmetics businesses of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company <ORGANIZATION> Schering-Plough </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 120 million. Currently, <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> is in the process of acquiring assets of <ORGANIZATION> Minnetonka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> through a tender offer at $ 22.86 a share, or a total of $ 376.2 million. Once the process is completed, which is subject to clearance by federal anti-trust regulators, <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> will own <LOCATION> Minnetonka </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> cosmetics and accessories businessses that comprise fragrances Obsession and Obsession for men.

<TEXT>
 Two subsidiaries of an Italian agribusiness giant today filed a federal lawsuit seeking to block further implementation of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>'s order limiting soybean futures holdings, a CBOT official said. The lawsuit was filed against the exchange in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON>, CBOT spokesman. He said the exchange would `` vigorously'' fight the lawsuit. The parent of the two firms, <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION>, has denied it attempted to corner the soybean market, charging instead that a <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION>'s order calling for liquidation of large positions in the exchange's July contract `` undermines the reliability'' of such contracts. Soybean futures rebounded moderately in early trading today. Analysts said the buying was a reaction to a government report released late Wednesday that indicated spring soybean plantings were below expectations. Exchange spokesman <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> order was issued late Tuesday to correct a wide disparity between the number of contracts outstanding and the actual supply of soybeans available. In a statement released Wednesday in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ferruzi </PERSON> said its `` accumulation of beans was undertaken so that the group could assure the uninterrupted operation of its processing plants ... and to satisfy export commitments, particularly to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' `` All actions taken by the group were within accepted practices, and the emergency order ... was taken in disregard to the true economics of the marketplace,'' the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s leading grain trader, said it had been accumulating soybeans openly in compliance with CBOT rules because last year's drought could have caused a shortage, but it did not say how much it had bought. The statement also said the <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION> action would `` undermine the reliability of the contracts'' of the Board of Trade. In <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, the state agriculture commissioner on Wednesday asked the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to investigate whether any Board of Trade officials benefited from the emergency order. Commissioner <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said a drop in soybean prices would benefit those holding `` short'' positions, or obligations to sell soybeans. `` It is possible that some of the members of the board of directors who made this order held short positions and benefited greatly from this order,'' <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON>. Soybeans are used for products ranging from tofu and cooking oil to cosmetics and animal feed. Activity in the <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION> soybean pit, the world's largest for that commodity, was heaviest at the beginning and end of the session Wednesday as traders tried to sort rumors from facts. A <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION> soybean trader said the late sale Wednesday of 3 million to 4 million bushels by a large brokerage near the close of trading helped soybeans close 39 -LCB- cents down on the day at $ 6.86 -LCB- a bushel. The trader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that sale had all the earmarks of a foreign firm moving to comply with the <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION>'s emergency liquidation order. One of the reasons for the midday trading lull, according to several traders, was a report that a <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary in <LOCATION> Belle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chasse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, planned to ask a federal court for a restraining order against the <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION> action. Spokesman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Barron </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary declined to comment on the report. <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION>'s holdings in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> include <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION>, a grain elevator and land. <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON> said the exchange's board of directors issued the order to liquidate large soybean positions to correct a wide disparity between the number of contracts being held for deliverable supplies of the product and the actual supply of soybeans available. <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON> refused to comment on whether the <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION>'s effort was designed to break up any firm's attempt to corner the market. A number of traders and analysts compared the soybean market situation to an alleged effort by the Hunt brothers of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> a decade ago to corner the world silver market. But others doubted such extensive manipulation of the soybean market had taken place. The exchange ordered all traders holding commitments to buy or sell more than 3 million bushels of soybeans for delivery this month to reduce those positions by at least 20 percent each trading day through July 20, when the July contract expires. The emergency resolution said no trader may control more than 3 million bushels of July soybeans at the close of trading Tuesday, and no trader may control more than 1 million bushels by the contract's expiration two days later. Futures are binding contracts to buy or sell a set amount of a commodity at an agreed-upon price at a later date. A typical corner occurs when a trader holding a large number of buy contracts also owns so much of the commodity that sellers can not acquire enough to honor their delivery commitments. The artificial supply squeeze causes the commodity's price to soar until the trader working the corner sells out at a huge profit. The <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> also quoted unidentified sources saying the <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION> action stemmed in part from complaints by <PERSON> Archer </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, Ill.-based agribusiness giant. <ORGANIZATION> ADM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Burket </PERSON> said the company had no comment Wednesday. A trading source who insisted on anonymity told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that the situation began as a battle between <ORGANIZATION> ADM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> for export business. `` <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> was smart enough to cover itself by getting supplies from the cash market and the futures market,'' he said. `` ADM relied almost entirely on the futures market. When supplies got tight, <ORGANIZATION> ADM </ORGANIZATION> had to go to the cash market to satisfy export demands and the tighter the supply, the higher the premium they paid.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates the futures industry, said Wednesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that it had been monitoring the soybean market for several months. But it would not comment on whether an investigation was under way into any attempt to corner the soybean market.

<HEAD>Isoceles Claims Control of Gateway</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Isosceles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday claimed victory in its nearly 3-month-old battle for <ORGANIZATION> Gateway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, saying it had more than 50 percent of the British food store group's shares under its control A rival bidding group that includes the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment firm <PERSON> Wasserstein </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Perella </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said it would n't give up its interest in Gateway. It said it would hold on to its stake of nearly 34 percent in Gateway and that it would be an active shareholder. Isosceles, a group of disgruntled Gateway shareholders, said it had received acceptances for its 2.1 billion-pound, the equivalent of about $ 3.4 billion, bid from shareholders owning 120.7 million ordinary shares, or 13.5 percent of the total. Isosceles already owned 37.4 percent of Gateway shares. The announcement claiming control came minutes after the rival bidders said they had bought an additional 20.3 million Gateway shares in the market Wednesday to lift their holdings to 33.79 percent. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Newgateway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, the takeover vehicle of <PERSON> Wasserstein </PERSON>, <PERSON> Perella </PERSON> and its partner, <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` There's no drama'' in <LOCATION> Isosceles </LOCATION> crossing the 50-percent threshold first. Isosceles' gaining a majority stake in Gateway stock `` was always a possibility'' that was considered at the time <PERSON> Newgateway </PERSON> made its `` final offer,'' said the spokesman, who was n't identified, in accordance with British custom. Isosceles began its hostile takeover attempt in April, offering 210 pence, or about $ 3.42, a share. Later, it increased its offer to 230 pence, or $ 3.75, a share after <PERSON> Newgateway </PERSON> entered the bidding. Newgateway's offer stands at 242 pence, or $ 3.94, a share. <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Monk </PERSON>, Gateway,'s chairman, said the situation was `` still a stalemate,'' and that Isosceles would need around 75 percent of Gateway to `` consolidate'' the company. `` And they ca n't possibly achieve that because Newgateway controls nearly 34 percent,'' Monk added. Isosceles plans to break up Gateway, to help repay its debt, by selling 62 major superstores to <ORGANIZATION> Asda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> for around 703 million pounds, or about $ 1.15 billion. Although <PERSON> Newgateway </PERSON>'s bid is also highly leveraged, the group has pledged to sell only a limited number of less profitable stores. Isosceles can press ahead with its reorganization plans with just over 50 percent control, but analysts predict it will run into fierce resistance from <LOCATION> Newgateway </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Newgateway </PERSON> said it `` looks forward to its role as a major long-term shareholder in Gateway.'' `` We regard this as an important investment in a major British food retailer,'' the group said. `` We intend to be an active shareholder.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Surge On Ferruzzi Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soybean futures prices closed sharply higher Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> following news of a lawsuit seeking to block the exchange's order that traders reduce their holdings in the July soybean contract. Wheat and oat futures also advanced while corn futures finished mixed. Two subsidiaries of Italian agribusiness giant <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION> filed a lawsuit in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> seeking an injunction against the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>'s emergency directive. The exchange's order, issued Tuesday, is widely seen as an attempt to block an attempt by <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> to control the soybean market. Soybeans had opened strongly higher, but the market had eased by midday on profit-taking. Wire service reports of <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION>'s lawsuit appeared at about 1 p.m. CDT. `` From the time it showed on the wire, we had a pretty decent recovery in here,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, grain market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. At the close, wheat was unchanged to 2 -LCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.90 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 6 \ cents lower to -RCB- cent higher with July at $ 2.56 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 3 cents to 4 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 1.48 \ a bushel; soybeans were 9 -RCB- cents to 18 -LCB- cents higher with July up 10 -LCB- cents at $ 6.97 a

 Stock prices gained more ground today, extending the advance that carried the market to new post-crash highs on Wednesday. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 92.57 points over the past seven sessions, rose another 12.70 to 2,545.33 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street. Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 733 up, 696 down and 519 unchanged. Analysts said some traders had grown leery of chasing after stocks following the market's latest rally, which produced gains in each of the first seven trading days in July. But Wall Streeters were looking ahead optimistically to several economic reports due from the government on Friday, including monthly statistics on industrial production and the producer price index of finished goods. The figures are expected to provide further confirmation that economic growth is slowing, fulfilling a primary goal of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s credit policy. Investors will give especially close scrutiny to the report on producer prices which, if it lives up to its advance billing, will show a slackening of inflationary pressures. Gainers among the blue chips included <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>, up 1 -LCB- at 48 ~; <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION>, up -RRB- at 115 -LRB-; Union carbide, up ~ at 28, and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, up -LCB- at 42 -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> tumbled 6 \ to 18 -RRB- The company, which had been soliciting takeover bids, said it had attracted no suitable offers and expects to remain independent.

 <ORGANIZATION> Mack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trucks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has notified the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> that it will not appeal the results of a union election held at its new plant in <LOCATION> Winnsboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, the company said Thursday. By doing so, the company said it would recognize the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> and proceed to negotiations for a contract. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> said the new policy was in the best interest of the company and its customers. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> is one of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest producers of heavy-duty deisel trucks. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> vehicles are sold and serviced in more than 65 countries around the world. Shortly after the union election in April, <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> officials said the Allentown-based company would block certification of the results and refuse to recognize the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. Some workers in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> reversed its policy because of <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reins </PERSON>, the company's new president. Reins, former president of <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> Automotive of <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, was named <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>'s president on June 13. In a surprise visit to the 23-month-old plant in <LOCATION> Winnsboro </LOCATION> last week, he spoke with many of the 850 workers. `` I talked to him at the plant,'' said <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Feagin </PERSON>, a worker who heads the plant's <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolinians </ORGANIZATION> backing the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>. `` He told me and many other people that he thought this situation had to be resolved. `` He was determined to squash the appeals and give us a contract. He said we deserved one.'' Reins then urged <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>'s board of directors to change tactics with the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>, the union said. The board, chaired by chief executive officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Curcio </PERSON>, agreed. Workers in <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>'s plants in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> earn up to $ 15 per hour. If <LOCATION> Winnsboro </LOCATION> workers are elevated to that level from their current $ 10 per hour, <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> will be handed an annual wage increase of more than $ 8 million.

 Japanese businessmen and trade officials see dismal prospects for investment in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in the coming year, and dispute suggestions <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> may profit from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s current political maladies. Fears that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will take advantage of the flight of other foreign businesses to tighten its grip on the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> market are unfounded, said one Japanese trade office manager. `` It's a big misunderstanding'' said the official, who like other Japanese interviewed spoke on condition he not be identified. He said that since the June 3-4 military assault on pro-democracy protesters in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, not one trade delegation from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has passed through his office. After the attack, there was a mass exodus of foreigners, including the Japanese. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> warned its businessmen against a quick return, saying it would give the impression of a `` thief at a fire'' _ someone profiting from another's misfortune. About half the 1,000 Japanese based in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> have returned and more are expected back in the coming week. Most however, have come mainly to settle accounts or fulfill existing contracts, one of them said. A few companies may eventually reduce their staff here, he said. `` No one will increase'' their Japanese employees. <ORGANIZATION> Matsushita </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Naomi </PERSON> <PERSON> Haga </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> that an official opening planned for late July for a joint venture that has begun producing color TV sets was now `` impossible.'' `` <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> is under martial law, and the Japanese government urged Japanese to leave the country,'' he said. `` We ca n't give the project up ... It would violate the contract. But it's dangerous to be there now, and we do n't have enough Japanese at the site to keep it on schedule.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Prime Minister Sousuke Uno has said economic sanctions wo n't be imposed on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> has stopped high-level contacts and put off discussions on $ 5.8 billion in official development loans <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is to provide <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for the 1990-95 period. More important, said an embassy official in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, Japanese companies wo n't be investing in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in the near future because of an erosion of trust in the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government. `` Even if martial law is lifted, the government has already lost too much credibility,'' he said. He said Chinese companies will have increasing difficulties borrowing money on the world market. One Japanese securities firm has put off lending $ 100 million to southern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Guangdong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The embassy official said Japanese companies, much criticized by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for their reluctance to invest in projects, had finally decided the time was right after former Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> signed an investment protection agreement in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in August. Since then, more than $ 100 million in investment had been pledged. But <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s recent crackdown on political dissent, and fears the arbitrary use of force could some day be applied to the foreign business community, `` have thrown cold water'' on future investment plans, he said. So far, no one is talking about leaving. `` It's too early for such a decision,'' said <PERSON> Kazuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeda </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan-China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> and Trade in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` Most companies are watching the conditions, seeing what direction the Chinese government takes.'' Those already in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> wo n't give up, he said, but for at least a year there will be few newcomers, he said. Short-term prospects also were poor for trade between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and its biggest trading partner outside <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. Last year trade volume reached a nearly balanced $ 19.3 billion, and expectations were it would top $ 20 billion this year. In the first five months of 1989, trade was up 15 percent to $ 8.2 billion. But the political chaos, coming on top of a faltering economy, has put many Chinese companies in a serious economic pinch. Japanese steelmakers temporarily suspended shipments to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> because they could n't get letters of credit from Chinese banks. Chinese companies ca n't get funds for raw materials because of the government's tough austerity policies that have dried up credit. The diplomat said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> can finally produce the quality light industrial goods and silk that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> demands, but now ca n't deliver the goods because of transportation, supply and energy problems. He said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus is likely to grow again, although <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> may move to cut back imports as its exports tail off. He said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has exhausted most of its investment possibilities in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries, and Japanese companies looking for ways to spend their money still consider <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> the top candidate in the long run. But every Japanese interviewed stressed that `` caution'' will be the guiding principle. `` The Chinese say there will be no change in their open-door policy but at the same time they are criticizing capitalism,'' the trade official said. `` For the time being, we'll have to wait and watch.

 When <PERSON> Geo </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hormel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> meatpackers were threatening to strike nearly four years ago, two reporters bet on how long the strike would last. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Klauda </PERSON> said more than 10 days. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Hage </PERSON> said one day or less, thinking the strike would never happen. `` I thought they would realize before they came to the brink that the strike would be a failure and that they would n't strike,'' <PERSON> Hage </PERSON> said. He was wrong. The bitter strike in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, lasted for months and provided <PERSON> Hage </PERSON> and <PERSON> Klauda </PERSON>, both reporters for the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, with enough drama to fill a nearly 400-page book. `` No Retreat, No Surrender: Labor's War at <ORGANIZATION> Hormel </ORGANIZATION>,'' published in June by <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morrow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, is one of several books about the strike due on the market this year `` There were so many strands that went beyond just a normal labor-management fight. It was n't just another strike,'' said <PERSON> Klauda </PERSON>, who teamed with <PERSON> Hage </PERSON> to follow the battle for the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. The walkout's intriguing ingredients included the presence of a Fortune 500 company in a small southern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> town; the half-century of labor peace <PERSON> Hormel </PERSON> had enjoyed; the benign history of the <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> union, which struck for three days in 1933; and the local's hiring of flamboyant union consultant <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, known for organizing <PERSON> J.P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> textile mills in the South and, more recently, helping <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strikers in their battle with management. `` You just stumbled across one great story after another,'' said <PERSON> Hage </PERSON>. `` And there just was n't time to go back and revisit those people to explore a certain accusation or to get to know a certain person better, because tomorrow or Sunday there's always another news story to write.'' For a time, the strike was one of the nation's top labor stories. While other plants in the <ORGANIZATION> Hormel </ORGANIZATION> chain agreed to wage concessions, workers in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> decided to fight a proposed wage cut. More than 1,400 union members walked off their jobs on Aug. 17, 1985. Local P-9 of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> objected to a profitable company imposing a wage cut; <PERSON> Hormel </PERSON> said the cut was needed for the company to stay competitive. Since the strike ended, the maker of Spam luncheon meat, Cure 81 ham and <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Label </ORGANIZATION> bacon has reported two consecutive years of record earnings, continuing a five-year stretch of increasing profits. Hage and <PERSON> Klauda </PERSON> said the strike symbolized worker anxiety about concessions in the 1980s. But they concluded it failed to turn the tide, partly because events in a town of 23,000 were n't going to reverse nationwide economic forces. `` You're not going to overturn the high unemployment rate,'' <PERSON> Hage </PERSON> said. `` You're not going to overturn all these trends in the meatpacking industry that involve non-union competitors and falling red-meat consumption.'' In their book, <PERSON> Hage </PERSON> and <PERSON> Klauda </PERSON> trace the roots of the strike, the first against <PERSON> Hormel </PERSON> since the <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> walkout 52 years before. The reporters found it ironic that <PERSON> Hormel </PERSON>, with a history of good labor relations and innovations such as profit-sharing dating to the 1930s, was the target of such bitterness. They also were fascinated by <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Guyette </PERSON>, the young P-9 president elected on a no-concessions platform. <PERSON> Guyette </PERSON> and other local officers were suspended by the <ORGANIZATION> UFCW </ORGANIZATION> international union, which took control of P-9 for refusing to end the strike and negotiated a settlement ratified in September 1986. The trusteeship has since been lifted and new local officers elected. In <LOCATION> Klauda </LOCATION>'s view, the uncompromising <PERSON> Guyette </PERSON> was driven `` the same way someone would be driven to go serve in a Third World country, -LRB- in -RRB- some kind of humanitarian way.'' <PERSON> Guyette </PERSON> now works for a hospital and health-care workers union in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. `` I was after a fair and decent contract that people could work under,'' said in an interview. `` A safe place to work. A place where you did n't have to raise your hand to go to the bathroom. That's all I was after.'' Five months after the strike began, <PERSON> Hormel </PERSON> reopened the plant and began hiring replacement workers. The company was flooded by applicants and former strikers who crossed the picket line. Gov. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> called out the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to maintain order at the plant. One of those hired as a replacement worker was <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahey </PERSON>, whose book on the strike, `` Packing It In! The Hormel Strike 1985-86,'' was published in April by <ORGANIZATION> Kirwin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fahey </PERSON> concludes <PERSON> Hormel </PERSON> was the wrong target for a meatpackers strike and that <PERSON> Guyette </PERSON> was on an `` ego trip.'' `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Guyette </PERSON> had a very strong ego, and he ran into another ego just as strong: <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Knowlton </PERSON> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Hormel </ORGANIZATION>'s president, board chairman and chief executive officer -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Fahey </PERSON> said. `` Thing was, <PERSON> Knowlton </PERSON> had more horses.'' Another book, `` On Strike at <ORGANIZATION> Hormel </ORGANIZATION>,'' takes a pro-strike side and offers an insider's account, according to its author, <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>. The book will be published this fall by <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> worked for <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION>' New York-based Corporate Campaign and was in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> for much of the strike. He disputes claims that <PERSON> Guyette </PERSON> was on a `` power trip.'' `` Anyone who was in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> could see this was not the strike of one person,'' he said. `` It could never be the strike of one person leading a bunch of zombies, because these people went all over the country.'' Three years since the strike ended, there are signs that wounds are healing in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hormel </PERSON> has notified 35 of 442 former strikers on a preferential hiring list that they will be called back to work by July 24. The company also held an employee appreciation picnic in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> that attracted more than 5,000. But some scars remain. `` You almost wonder whether some day grandkids are going to look back and say, ` Which side were you on?''' <PERSON> Hage </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Chemical, Bank of New York Report 2nd Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday reported static earnings for the second quarter while profits at the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> more than doubled as the result of its acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> late last year. At <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION>, income gains were offset by higher expenses and a slump in bond trading profits. For the quarter ended June 30, <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> reported net income of $ 128.6 million, up 0.7 percent from $ 127.7 million in the year-ago period. Earnings per share fell 16.7 percent from $ 1.98 a year ago to $ 1.65 in the second quarter because of an increase in the number of common shares outstanding. Chemical issued 7 million shares in December. Net interest income totaled $ 565 million, down 5 percent from $ 595.1 million. Chemical attributed the decrease to $ 4.4 billion lower average earning assets resulting from the divestiture of certain businesses and assets. Non-interest income, including fees for trust and other banking services, totaled $ 252.2 million, up 12.6 percent from $ 223.9 million a year ago. Provision for loan losses totaled $ 90.9 million, which includes $ 45 million loaned to countries that are rescheduling their debt. A year ago, <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION>'s loan-loss provision amounted to $ 95.8 million. Chemical said profits from foreign exchange trading totaled a record $ 51.5 million during the quarter, but trading account activities lost $ 1.8 million, compared with a $ 25.7 million profit a year ago. For the first six months, <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> said net income totaled $ 246.5 million, down 3 percent from $ 253.2 million in the first half of 1988. Earnings per share totaled $ 3.14, down from $ 3.93. Net interest income totaled $ 1.16 billion for the first two quarters, down from $ 1.17 billion a year ago. Non-interest income rose 14.4 percent to $ 497.8 million from $ 435 million a year ago. Total assets amounted to $ 75.9 billion at the end of the second quarter, compared with $ 75.8 billion a year ago. At the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, net income for the second quarter totaled $ 114.3 million, up 130 percent from $ 49.7 million a year ago. The jump reflects the November 1988 acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. Earnings per share on a fully diluted basis amounted to $ 1.55, up from $ 1.30 a year ago. Chairman <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacot </PERSON> noted in a statement that the bank experienced strong growth in all major commercial lending areas during the second quarter. He also noted that `` cost savings arising from the merger are being realized sooner than anticipated.'' Net interest income totaled $ 327.5 million, up 84 percent from $ 177.8 million a year ago. Non-interest income, bolstered by loan syndication fees and credit card fees totaled $ 230.8 million, compared with $ 119.4 a year ago. Allowances for loan losses totaled $ 919.3 million at the end of the second quarter, compared with $ 31.9 million a year ago. The bank reported a $ 30.6 million charge-off related to its non-performing Argentine debt. For the first six months, net income totaled $ 215.4 million, or $ 2.92 a share, up 107 percent from $ 104.1 million, or $ 2.77 a share a year ago. Net interest earnings totaled $ 653.2 million, up from $ 360.7 million in the first six months of 1988. Non-interest income totaled $ 469.9 million, up from $ 233.9 million a year ago. Total assets at the end of the quarter amounted to $ 49.59 billion, up 109 percent from $ 23.62 billion a year ago.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> abandoned a $ 400 million note issue Thursday because of what it called market disruption caused by a hostile $ 21 billion takeover bid from an investor group led by Sir <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>. The issue, set for completion Monday, would have been one of the biggest Eurobond offerings ever by a non-U.S. company. The London-based conglomerate said it also withdrew the issue to protect its investors against substantial losses that could result from `` the hostile and highly leveraged nature of the bid.'' The group, which also includes British merchant banker <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON> and Australian entrepreneur <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>, is offering the equivalent of $ 13.86 a share in debt securities to acquire BAT, a tactic that underscores the growing dominance of the American style on the worldwide takeover scene. American-sized, it is four times bigger than the previous biggest British bid and rivals the record $ 25 billion buyout earlier this year of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food and tobacco giant <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Instead of cash, the group's offer uses junk bonds, an American financing technique not readily accepted on this side of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. Both sides also have lined up leading American investment bankers as soldiers, and many of the battles are expected to take place before <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> courts and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> insurance regulators. BAT has wide-ranging interests in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Williamson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>'s department stores. Forty-one percent of <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION>'s pre-tax profit and 30 percent of its revenue came from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> last year. BAT immediately rejected the offer from the <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> group after it was launched Tuesday through a newly formed company called <ORGANIZATION> Hoylake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. BAT's shares on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> continued retreating toward the offering price, finishing down the equivalent of 24 cents at $ 14.05 Thursday. Junk bonds, such as those the Goldsmith group is offering in its cashless bid, are not as widely used or accepted in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, where high-debt ventures are less common than in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Junk bonds are high-yield, high-risk debt securities commonly used to finance takeovers and corporate expansions in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Their name comes from their low credit rating, which means they have a greater risk of default than higher-rated bonds. Also new to the relatively staid British takeover scene is the break-up of such a large company. <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> said he wanted to `` unbundle'' BAT by selling off its non-tobacco interests, which he claims have depressed the company's stock price. In the BAT war, the offense has lined up junk bond pioneers <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> among its financing pros. Its legal advisers include <LOCATION> Skadden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arps </LOCATION>, Slate, <PERSON> Meagher </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Flom </ORGANIZATION>, a prominent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> takeover law firm. The defense quickly enlisted <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to help <ORGANIZATION> Lazard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plot its strategy. Aggressive American investment firms have been leaders in developing sophisticated takeover and anti-takeover techniques honed during the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merger mania of the 1980s. In addition, `` With all the big buyout funds in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and most of the big buyout funds being led by Americans, that -LRB- lining up <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> firms -RRB- would be both a defensive and an aggressive move,'' said <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherling </PERSON>, a director of the buyout firm <ORGANIZATION> Alan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patricof </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. BAT's defense might be a management buyout, which could be financed partly with funds from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investors, <PERSON> Sherling </PERSON> said. `` I'm sure that it would be led from the <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and therefore by having <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> advisers they would have a more direct line to the cash,'' <PERSON> Sherling </PERSON> said. He also noted the <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> group had enlisted high-powered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> takeover firms for the same reason BAT has. `` If you're sitting there as an aggressor trying to figure out what the defensive strategy would be, you would figure they would use American advisers and you would try to cut them off at the pass and get the best ones,'' <PERSON> Sherling </PERSON> said.

 Actor <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> settled his lawsuit Thursday against <ORGANIZATION> Sperry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which dropped him as spokesman two years ago when it merged with <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to form <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The settlement, for an undisclosed amount, occurred just as jury selection was to begin in federal court in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. `` I've never been in a courtroom before except in a movie _ and then I always knew my lines,'' <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> said after the settlement. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> had filed a breach of contract suit two years ago against <PERSON> Sperry </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>, claiming termination of the contract wrecked his chances of getting a `` similarly prestigious and rewarding contract with any other major <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. corporation.'' The $ 17.8 million suit was later amended to $ 1.25 million. Terms of the settlement were n't revealed, but <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> said, `` Everyone is satisfied, I'm happy. ... I'm pleased it was amicably settled.'' <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> was <PERSON> Sperry </PERSON>'s corporate spokesman from October 1985 until it was acquired by <PERSON> Burroughs </PERSON> on Sept. 16, 1986. The company told <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> in a letter that it was assuming `` a new company name and corporate identity,'' and refused to take on <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>' contract. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, star of `` Spartacus,'' `` Lust for Life'' and more than 70 other films, had claimed that the contract was supposed to continue if the Sperry product line or corporate identity survived a merger. The suit cited the continued marketing of some products with the Sperry logo. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> maintained that a clause in <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>' contract said that in the event of a merger, the contract would not continue unless both parties agreed, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hynes </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, Pa.-based information systems company. `` I am grateful to go back to the world of make believe,'' said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, who was accompanied in court by his wife, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> made personal appearances, television commercials and said he interrupted filming of `` Tough Guys'' with <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Lancaster </PERSON> to make a promotional film for <LOCATION> Sperry </LOCATION>. He said he has n't worked for any other companies as a spokesman, but would consider doing it again.

 Stock prices pushed ahead today, extending the advance that carried the market to new post-crash highs on Wednesday. Analysts said some traders had grown leery of chasing after stocks following the market's latest rally, which produced gains in each of the first seven trading days in July. But Wall Streeters were looking ahead optimistically to several economic reports due from the government on Friday, including monthly statistics on industrial production and the producer price index of finished goods. The figures are expected to provide further confirmation that economic growth is slowing, fulfilling a primary goal of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s credit policy. Investors will give especially close scrutiny to the report on producer prices which, if it lives up to its advance billing, will show a slackening of inflationary pressures.

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that net income for the second quarter rose 6 percent as nearly each of its main business units posted gains in operating profits. For the quarter ended June 30, <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> reported net income of $ 228.3 million, or $ 1.56 per share, up from $ 215.3 million, or $ 1.47 a share in the year-ago period. Net income for the 1988 period was restated to reflect a lower tax provision. Compared to previously reported results, second-quarter net income was up 13 percent. Revenue during the period rose 4.5 percent to $ 3.18 billion from $ 3.04 billion a year ago. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marous </PERSON> said in a statement, `` Orders entered for continuing businesses in the first half are up almost 10 percent over last year, and our backlog of $ 11.5 billion is a record for the decade.'' He also noted that `` order rates for both electronic systems and power generation were very strong. In fact, power generation is having its best order year since the mid 1970s.'' Operating profits from the energy and utility systems segment and the industrial segment rose, while operating profits from the broadcasting unit were even for the quarter but up for the year's first half Revenues from the financial services unit rose because of higher levels of outstanding loans and marketable securities, but operating profit for the quarter was static compared to the 1988 period. Operating profit from the electronic systems unit was up, while operating profit from the commercial group was even despite a sharp decline in the company's beverage business. For the year's first half, profits increased 5.4 percent to $ 417.3 million, or $ 2.86 per share, from a restated $ 395.8 million, or $ 2.72 per share. Revenue for the six-month period rose 4.7 percent to $ 6.06 billion from $ 5.79 billion.

 The dollar moved mostly higher against major foreign currencies Thursday in choppy trading ahead of potentially market-moving economic reports due Friday. Gold prices declined. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery fell $ 1.70 to $ 377.00 a troy ounce. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid of $ 375.50 for an ounce of gold bullion at 4 p.m. EDT, down from Wednesday's late bid of $ 377.40. Activity in the foreign exchange markets featured dealers adjusting their holdings in anticipation of government reports to be released Friday on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wholesale price inflation, retail sales and industrial production. `` I think people feel the statistics will be pointing to a weaker economy and hence a weaker dollar,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrissey </PERSON>, a trader in the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office. Despite this perception, the dollar finished higher against most currencies except the Japanese yen. The dollar's strength was a byproduct of dealers' desires to lighten their holdings of West German marks, mainly so they could buy more yen. Trading probably was slightly lighter than normal due to some reluctance to establish significant new positions before the annual economic summit of the Group of Seven major industrial countries, which gets under way Friday in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar closed lower at 139.05 Japanese yen, down from 140.50 late Wednesday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> late Thursday, the dollar traded higher at 139.20, and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar ended at 139.45 yen, down from 139.60 yen on Wednesday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound closed at $ 1.6240, cheaper for buyers than Wednesday's late level of $ 1.6255. Sterling fetched $ 1.6205 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared to $ 1.6300 on Wednesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late rates Wednesday, included: 1.8885 West German marks, up from 1.8745; 1.6240 Swiss francs, up from 1.6135; 1.19295 Canadian dollars, up from 1.18955; 6.4085 French francs, up from 6.3575; and, 1,369.50 Italian lire, up from 1,359.00. Late rates for the dollar in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with levels late Wednesday were: 1.8815 West German marks, up from 1.8755; 1.6190 Swiss francs, up from 1.6135; 6.3870 French francs, up from 6.3645; 2.1155 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1160; 1,362.25 Italian lire, up from 1,361.50; and, 1.1922 Canadian dollars, up from 1.18965. Bullion dealers said there was little interest in gold ahead of Friday's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic statistics. They said if the news indicated slower economic growth, that could push the dollar lower and gold could head upward. Gold closed in both <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> at a bid of $ 375.75 a troy ounce, down from Thursday's levels of $ 379.75 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and $ 379.50 in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>. Earlier in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold closed at $ 377.45 bid, down from $ 380.05. Silver bullion traded late in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at $ 5.20 bid a troy ounce, down from $ 5.27.

 Assets of the nation's 468 money market mutual funds increased by $ 4.39 billion in the latest week to a new record of $ 328.15 billion, the <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The rise in the seven-day period ended Wednesday broke the record set the previous week, when the fund assets rose by a revised $ 2.96 billion to total $ 323.76 billion, the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. That weekly rise originally was reported as $ 2.83 billion. The institute said that in the latest week, assets of 231 general purpose funds fell $ 196.4 million to $ 104.85 billion, assets of 95 broker-dealer funds increased $ 2.59 billion to $ 139.19 billion, and assets of 142 institutional funds rose $ 1.99 billion to $ 84.11 billion. The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in the week ended Tuesday to 8.75 percent from 8.85 percent the previous week, said <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON>'s Money Fund Report, a trade journal based in <LOCATION> Holliston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>.

 Stock prices posted their eight straight gain Thursday as traders waited hopefully for new signs of a slowing economy. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which closed Wednesday at a new high since the 1987 crash, rose another 5.69 to 2,538.32. That extended the average's gain so far this month to 98.26 points, leaving it about 184 points shy of the record closing high of 2,722.42 it reached on Aug. 25, 1987. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 6 to 5 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 798 up, 671 down and 526 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 153.80 million shares, down from 160.55 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 183.97 million shares. Analysts said traders were looking ahead optimistically to several economic reports due from the government on Friday, including monthly statistics on industrial production and the producer price index of finished goods. The figures are expected to provide further confirmation that economic growth is slowing, fulfilling a primary goal of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s credit policy. Investors were likely to give especially close scrutiny to the report on producer prices which, if it lives up to its advance billing, will show a slackening of inflationary pressures. Estimates on Wall Street call for the index to be up about 0.3 percent for June, compared to a 0.9 percent jump the month before. As had happened on Wednesday, the market encountered some mild selling in the first half of the session, but then resumed its advance in afternoon trading. <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>, widely discussed of late as a possible takeover candidate, jumped 6 -LCB- to 86. Other gainers among the blue chips included <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>, up 1 -RRB- at 48 -RCB-; <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>, up ~ at 99 -RCB-; <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>, up -RCB- at 27 ~, and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, up -RRB- at 42 <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> shares got a boost from better-than-expected domestic car sales for early July. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 to 65 \ The company reported second-quarter earnings of $ 1.56 a share, up from $ 1.47 a share in the comparable period last year. <ORGANIZATION> Shaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> picked up 1 to 16 -RCB-, also on higher quarterly profits. <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> tumbled 6 to 18 | The company, which had been soliciting takeover bids, said it had attracted no suitable offers and expects to remain independent. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market increased $ 4.31 billion, or 0.13 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks edged up .16 to 184.31. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index rose .26 to 376.50, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was up .14 at 329.95 The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained 1.08 to 447.89.

 Early-July sales of North American-made cars and light trucks jumped 8.9 percent over the same period last year, the companies reported Thursday. The eight major U.S.-based automakers reported they sold vehicles at an average rate of 35,614 a day during the July 1-10 period this year compared with a rate of 32,696 during the same time last year. Car sales were up 9.3 percent and truck sales rose 8.3 percent. `` It's got to be surprising that they were up that much,'' said analyst <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> But <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said he had expected sales to be a bit stronger because <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> had been advertising in incentive programs to take delivery by July 10. `` Early-July sales were inflated by that artificial July 10 deadline,'' he said, adding he expected slower mid-July sales. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s early-July car sales were up 11.3 percent and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales rose 16.9 percent. Car sales by <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> fell 5.8 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is plagued with product availability problems, <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> said. The company is getting production and marketing for its <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spirit </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acclaim </ORGANIZATION> in line as it phases out its K-cars, the Reliant and Aries. `` It's a phasing out and a phasing in and that's combined with an overall weak market,'' <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON> said. The industry's early-July increases are compared with a period last year that worked out to be just about on trend for the entire year, the second-best in the industry's history. But for 1989 as a whole, sales this year are lagging behind last year's pace. The eight companies reported their combined car and light truck sales ran 4.4 percent behind last year's pace through July 10. So far this yea, the automakers have sold vehicles at a daily rate of 38,100 compared with a rate of 39,835 a day last year. Car sales were down 5.6 percent and truck sales were off 2.1 percent. One of the surprises in the early-July sales figures was a 31.8 percent drop in sales of U.S.-made Hondas. Demand for the cars has been tapering off and the company has offered its dealers incentives to get customers in showrooms. <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON> said there may be another problem. `` There's going to be a new Accord launched in the fall and when you know that, why do you want to buy last year's model?'' she said. Among the Big Three, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> sold cars at a daily rate of 6,923 during early July this year, up from a 5,919 car-a-day rate during the same time last year. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales so far this year were running 2.5 percent behind last year's pace. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> truck dealers were selling 3.6 percent more vehicles in early July this year than last year, but 3.8 percent fewer so far this year. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales went at a daily rate of 10,615 during early July this year compared with a rate of 9,534 during the same time last year. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales for the year were down 9 percent from last year. The company's truck sales ran 13.2 percent ahead of last year's pace in early July but were down 2.8 percent for the entire year <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales fell to a daily rate of 2,921 this year from the 3,100 daily rate of a year ago. For the calendar year, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales were down 14.6 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s trucks sold at a rate 1.6 percent higher in early July this year than they did a year ago. For the year, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s truck sales were down 0.7 percent.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported a 27 percent drop in its second-quarter earnings and blamed much of the fall on the costs of three aircraft programs. The aerospace company said its after-tax earnings in the second quarter fell to $ 77 million, or $ 1.20 a share, from $ 106 million, or $ 1.77 a share, in 1988's second quarter. Revenue declined 3 percent to $ 2.45 billion from $ 2.53 billion a year earlier. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tellep </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive, said the deterioration in profit reflected $ 27 million in costs involving three aircraft programs. One of the programs included a phase-out of <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>'s P-3 aircraft production. The plane designed for hunting submarines had no customer prospects. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> last year selected <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> for development of the P-7A, a new generation anti-sub plane. The other two programs on which cost adjustments were made involve fixed-price development contracts for modifications to two <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> C-5As to transport space cargo and modification of a C-141 for an advance radar test bed. The overall decline in 1989 revenue and earnings was largely due to the cost of completing the new generation C-5B, <PERSON> Tellep </PERSON> said in a news release, which called the outlook for new defense contracts `` flat to declining.'' `` We remain confident that <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>'s strong core business programs will provide the basis for resumed earnings growth in 1990,'' <PERSON> Tellep </PERSON> said, pointing to continuing projects such as the stealth fighter plane and the P-7A. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> in April issued 10.7 million shares for the <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION> plan and successfully thwarted <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' effort to take over the aerospace company. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>'s move put 17 percent of the company's stock in employee hands, making it impossible for <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> to acquire the 85 percent needed for buyout approval. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> acted before <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> made a tender offer. For the first half of the year, <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 139 million, or $ 2.25 a share, down 37 percent from earnings of $ 220 million, or $ 3.61 a share, in 1988's first six months. Revenue amounted to $ 4.45 billion, down from $ 4.92 billion.

 Pilots at <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> continued mediated contract talks Thursday but a union spokesman said the group is growing weary of the negotiations. `` We have made progress in the past few months but not enough progress,'' said <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` This thing has been going on for 2 -LCB- years and our pilots are running out of patience.'' <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON>, another spokesman for the pilots, told the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday that the union would consider asking for an impasse, which would free the pilots to strike after a 30-day cooling off period. Such a request would be decided by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON> told the newspaper the union would back away from considering such a request only if the two sides reach a tentative settlement or make substantial progress in their bargaining by Friday. But <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> backed away from the remark Thursday, saying a request for an impasse is only one of several options being considered by the pilots. He said the group is likely to make a statement next week about the status of negotiations, which resumed this week for the first time since mid-June, when <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> accepted a $ 4 billion buyout proposal from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Former </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airlines </LOCATION> pilots who joined <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> in the acquisition of Republic in late 1986 have been without a contract for the past 2 -LCB- years while the contract covering <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> pilots expired three years ago. Talks to bring the pilots under one pact began in April 1987 and broke off last November, when 96 percent voted to authorize a strike. Northwest then requested federal mediation and talks resumed in December. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said more progress has been made in the past two months than in the previous two years, but he said serious disagreements remain over wages, work rules and benefits. Northwest spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> said it's a positive sign that the two sides are still at the bargaining table. `` As long as we are meeting we can move toward an agreement,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>. `` There is momentum there and hopefully we can keep that going.''

 Lawyers seeking to represent more than 80,000 people filed suit Thursday against the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and leveraged buyout specialist <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> seeking to reverse the $ 2.4 billion takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Jim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> two years ago. The lawsuit, filed in state court in <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION>, claims the buyout was a fraudulent attempt to escape more than $ 3 billion in liabilities stemming from asbestos claims against <ORGANIZATION> Celotex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, Fla.-based home-builder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON>, also named as a defendant. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> last year sold <ORGANIZATION> Celotex </ORGANIZATION>, a long-time producer of asbestos, which has been proven to cause cancer and other health problems. `` I think this will prove to be a landmark case in this country,'' <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Susman </PERSON> said after the lawsuit was filed. However, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> said the claims were similar to those in a suit already in federal court and were without merit. The suit, which asks for class action status, seeks no monetary damages for three named plaintiffs or for the thousands of others it says have similar, separate lawsuits pending in courts around the country. Instead, it attempts to prevent the further sale of any <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> assets and to hold <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> and the remaining corporate structure responsible for any judgments related to asbestos-related lawsuits. `` We want to undo this transaction,'' <PERSON> Susman </PERSON> said. `` We want the people responsible for this transaction to be liable for any judgments in favor of more than 80,000 people who are seeking justice.'' The suit alleges <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION>' 1987 buyout of <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> was part of a scheme by <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> to evade its liability in the growing number of lawsuits being filed against <ORGANIZATION> Celotex </ORGANIZATION>. `` The intended effect of these transactions was to strip <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> of virtually all of its valuable assets and, as a necessary consequence, to limit the resources available to satisfy asbestos judgments against <ORGANIZATION> Celotex </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON>,'' the lawsuit states. About $ 2 billion of the buyout was financed by bank loans, and the investment group led by <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> later sold bonds through <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to replace the bank debt. Selected <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> assets have since been sold to help pay for the deal. `` This was a standard, garden-variety leveraged buyout,'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON> said Thursday. `` Consequently, our position has been and continues to be that the allegations set forth in the previous -LRB- federal -RRB- complaint and in this complaint are totally without merit and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously.'' The federal suit is similar, but names neither <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> as defendants and is limited to those plaintiffs who filed their asbestos lawsuits within the <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Susman </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Daly </PERSON> said the lawsuit addressed `` the same substantive issues that are already in federal court. That suit is without merit, and we think we'll win it.'' <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON> said the firm declined comment on the suit since it had not seen it.

 The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply rose in the week ended July 3, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,101.1 billion from $ 3.093.9 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,992.0 billion from $ 3,977.4 billion. The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 777.4 billion from $ 769.5 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In judging its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> in February reaffirmed a provisional target for 1989 of 3 percent to 7 percent growth in M2 and 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent growth in M3. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has not set a target for M1 growth since early 1987. For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $ 3,081.9 billion, a 1.3 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13 weeks. M3 averaged $ 3,963.7 billion, up 3.1 percent, while M1 fell 5.5 percent to an average of $ 775.7 billion.

<HEAD>Soybeans Rally on Ferruzzi Lawsuit News; Sugar Soars</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Soybean futures prices rebounded Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> following news of a legal challenge to the exchange's order that traders liquidate their holdings in the July soybean contract. Wheat and oat futures also advanced while corn futures finished mixed. On other markets, sugar futures soared amid rumors of Soviet buying; cattle futures were up sharply; pork futures were mixed; energy futures advanced; and precious metals were mixed. Soybeans settled 10 cents to 17 -LCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in July up 11 cents at $ 6.97 -LCB- a bushel. Two subsidiaries of Italian agribusiness giant <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finanziara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION> filed a lawsuit in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> seeking an injunction against the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>'s emergency directive. The exchange's order, issued Tuesday, was widely seen as an attempt to block an attempt by <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> to control the soybean market. Soybeans had opened strongly higher on Wednesday's government report of smaller-than-expected soybean plantings but the market had eased by midday on profit-taking. Wire service reports of <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION>'s lawsuit appeared at about 1 p.m. CDT `` From the time it showed on the wire, we had a pretty decent recovery in here,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, grain market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Analysts said the soybean market would likely take its cues Friday from the outcome of the soybean ruling. Corn futures finished narrowly mixed with most of the pressure stemming from Wednesday's <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> crop report, which showed larger-than-expected corn plantings. The wheat market got a late boost from rumors that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had purchased a large quantity of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat. Wheat settled unchanged to 2 -RCB- cents higher with July at $ 3.90 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 5 -RCB- cents lower to -LCB- cent higher with July at $ 2.56 \ a bushel; oats were 3 cents to 4 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 1.48 \ a Sugar futures prices soared on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on market talk that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was interested in buying up to 100,000 metric tons of white sugar for August shipment. Sugar settled .50 cent to 1.11 cents higher with October at 13.67 cents a pound. Cattle futures posted near-limit gains as stronger cash markets added to the bullish enthusisam generated by expecatations for a steep decline in supplies by mid-August. Market analysts are predicting that next Friday's quarterly <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> cattle-on-feed report will show a sharp reduction in placements of cattle on feedlots during the second quarter. Live cattle were .62 cent to 1.35 cents higher with August at 71.92 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .55 cent to 1.35 cents higher with August at 82.95 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent lower to .45 cent higher with July at 47.07 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 1.2 cents lower to .08 cent higher with July at 28.95 cents a pound. Cattle futures are limited to movements of 1.5 cents a pound. Energy futures advanced slightly on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on fears that maintenance and platform workers on <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil rigs might go on strike. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 20 cents to 44 cents higher with August at $ 20.35 a barrel; heating oil was .50 cent to .72 cent higher with August at 49.44 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .05 cent to .28 cent higher with August at 57.46 cents a gallon. Gold futures slipped a bit and silver inched higher in subdued trading ahead of Friday's bevy of economic reports. Gold settled $ 1.70 to $ 1.90 lower with August at $ 378.50 a troy ounce; silver was 0.3 cent to 0.7 cent higher with July at $ 5.195 a troy ounce.

 <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cellular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is discussing a $ 127.50 per share buyout offer for <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> that would give <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> shareholders stock in <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION>, the companies said Thursday. A <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the new cash and common stock offer replaces the $ 110 per share cash offer <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> made for <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> on Monday following a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> court settlement unfavorable to LIN. That offer was to expire July 21. The new offer raises to $ 6.2 billion the total amount <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> would have to spend to acquire the 90.2 percent of <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION>'s 53.9 million shares that it does not already own. The $ 110 a share offer was worth $ 5.36 billion. If the <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, Wash.-based <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION>'s takeover attempt is successful, it would solidify <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>'s position as the nation's largest cellular telephone company The new offer came after LIN complained that the $ 110 per share offer was less than what <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> believes LIN is worth. The offer of `` $ 110 -LRB- per share -RRB- is gone. Negotiations led to a higher price potential,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> of <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> <PERSON> MacGregor </PERSON>, <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>'s outside public investor relations counsel in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He said the price was upped in `` an attempt to reach a friendly transaction.'' Negotiations resumed between the two companies' advisers on Tuesday. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> said the cash portion of the new offer could be higher than $ 110 per share. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> had originally bid $ 120 per share for <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION>. The amount of McCaw that would be held by LIN will be determined by the final cash offer and the price of <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> stock on the day a deal is closed, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> said. It is not clear if the Class A common stock would be new stock or existing shares, he said. The shares will have voting rights, he said. The offer `` means participation by LIN in <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. When asked if <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> wants participation on <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>'s board, he said, `` Everything is under discussion.'' Trading in both companies' stocks was heavy on Thursday. They are each traded in the over-the-counter market. McCaw closed at $ 40 per share, down 12 -LCB- cents, on a trading volume of 1.1 million shares. LIN rose $ 2.50 a share to $ 116.75 on volume of nearly 1.8 million shares. In a joint statement, the companies said the proposal provides for each share of <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> stock to be exchanged for cash and stock having an aggregate value of $ 127.50 a share. The companies cautioned that `` there can be no assurances'' the new offer will result in an agreement. The announcement came a day after <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> disclosed in a filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> had `` recommenced negotiations through their advisers.'' The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> recently denied <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION>'s claims to certain cellular interests of <ORGANIZATION> Metromedia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> markets.

<HEAD>Group Leading 3-Year-Old GE Boycott Claims It's Bruised Company's
Business</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An antinuclear group that has led a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> boycott for three years released figures Thursday aimed at showing the campaign has cost the corporate giant $ 50.6 million in lost business. GE rejected the claims. The group <ORGANIZATION> INFACT </ORGANIZATION> based the calculation on the number of people whom it said have joined the boycott in an attempt to drive GE and other defense contractors out of the nuclear weapons industry. `` GE wants you to think it brings good things to life,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, executive director of the group. `` It also brings death and destruction. We think that's got to be stopped.'' INFACT stands for <ORGANIZATION> Infant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Formula </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>. The Boston-based group organized a boycott of the <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> a decade ago to stop that company from selling what <ORGANIZATION> INFACT </ORGANIZATION> said was unsafe powdered baby's milk. The group switched to the GE boycott in July 1986 and has claimed widespread success. By <ORGANIZATION> INFACT </ORGANIZATION>'s calculations, at least 2.53 million people worldwide have stopped buying GE products because of the boycott, resulting in lost revenue to the company of $ 25.32 million in heavily populated areas of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and an equal amount elsewhere. GE spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamison </PERSON> rejected <ORGANIZATION> INFACT </ORGANIZATION>'s assertions. `` Anybody can claim anything,'' <PERSON> Jamison </PERSON> said. `` The facts of the matter are, since 1985 GE revenues are up 56 percent from $ 32 billion to $ 50 billion. Earnings are up 49 percent. Also during that time, market share has increased in all GE consumer businesses. These are facts which are reported in our annual report. They speak for themselves.'' GE, based in <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, makes products ranging from dishwashers to jet engines to high-tech medical equipment. It is one of the nation's leading defense contractors and the fifth-largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrial concern. The company also owns the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> television network and a controlling interest in <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a large Wall Street investment firm. INFACT has targeted <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> because of what it calls `` the company's extensive involvement in the production and promotion of nuclear weaons and the trail of radioactive and toxic waste the company's nuclear weapons work leaves behind <PERSON> Jamison </PERSON> said `` <ORGANIZATION> INFACT </ORGANIZATION>'s goal is unilateral disarmament. We want peace every bit as much as INFACT does. But along with a majority of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> believes it can be assured only by a strong national defense.''

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, in response to an inquiry from the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday that it had no discussions about nor interest in acquiring <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, company issued its brief statement after <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> stock jumped $ 6 a share to close at $ 85.50 on the exchange. GE stock was unchanged at $ 54.38 -LCB-. GE did not comment beyond its statement and stock exchange officials left work before they could be contacted about it. Late last week, analysts attributed a similar increase in <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price to a rumor published in Business Week that <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> was considering acquiring the automated controls makers. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> previously declined to comment on the rumor, and <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> has refused to comment on all takeover speculation. Before <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> stock declined $ 1.75 Tuesday, it had been pushed up more than $ 9 in the two previous days of trading. It was down slightly Wednesday before surging again Thursday, when more than 2.1 million shares traded hands. `` The stock is trading very heavily,'' said <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivard </PERSON> of Minneapolis-based <ORGANIZATION> Dain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The action you're seeing in <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> can be attributed to more than the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> rumor.'' <PERSON> Rivard </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>'s value to an acquirer could range from $ 110 a share to $ 140 a share. Thursday's trading included the sale of a 500,000-share block of <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> stock at the market price, <PERSON> Rivard </PERSON> said. It was unclear who moved the block, he said. Takeover rumors concerning <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> intensified after the company lost $ 435 million in its fiscal 1988. Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Renier </PERSON> said at the company's annual meeting May 5 that the speculation was inevitable given the `` discrepancy between stock market values and perceived true-asset values.'' With the exception of fiscal 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>'s financial performance has lagged for the past seven years. The company sought approval at the annual meeting of two anti-takeover measures. But an opposition group led by <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, lobbied to defeat the proposals in a proxy fight. North American has said it is not interested in acquiring <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 A House-Senate conference trying to craft a savings and loan bailout bill adjourned Thursday night after 5 -LCB- hours of bitter and fruitless debate over how to proceed on a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> compromise proposal. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> issued a statement that the administration would `` strongly support'' the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> offer, although he said he wanted to review the details. Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., the leader of the five-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> team, suprised many <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members by starting the session with a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> offer for a comprehensive compromise and asking them to consider it overnight or over the weekend But the huge, 94-member <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> delegation was unable to respond because its leader, Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, has divided the delegation into platoons of between 20 and 30 members, each with jurisdiction over part of the bill. House delegates responded to <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> by voting to put the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> offer aside and proceeded to try to tackle the massive S & amp; L bill issue by issue as senators sat, rolling their eyes. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> side made proposals on capital standards and funding, essentially mirroring the original <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill, but the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> refused to consider them. At the end of the session shortly after 8 p.m., the only thing the two sides could agree on was a motion to meet at 10 a.m. Friday and try again. <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, explaining that each position in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> offer was `` cross-connected'' with the others, said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> could not proceed as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> wished and could only respond to a package counter offer from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't think we're communicating here,'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa., said Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> had made a `` bold, imaginative offer designed to seize the leadership of the conference.'' Meanwhile, Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, released a letter written from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who expressed strong support for the administration's plan to keep <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L rescue spending out of the budget deficit. It's the first time <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has addressed the issue personally, although <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> has threatened to recommend a veto if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> fails to adopt the administration plan. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not raise the threat of a veto in the letter. The conference committee, which held its first substantive session on Tuesday, is trying to resolve differences between the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill passed in April and the House bill passed in June. Both sides, noting that savings and loans are losing at least $ 10 million a day, say urgent action is needed and are aiming to send a compromise to the White House for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s signature before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leaves on its August vacation. Among the key elements of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> offer are: _ Acceptance of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to require S & amp; L owners to risk $ 3 in real, tangible capital for every $ 100 in lending by Jan. 1, 1995 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill had provided a laxer standard of $ 1.50. _ Adoption of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration plan to keep S & amp; L rescue spending out of the budget deficit The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had favored a plan that would have swelled the deficit by $ 44 billion over three years, arguing that it was a more honest way of accounting for the spending. _ A compromise on junk bond ownership by <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls, limiting S & amp; Ls to a junk bond portfolio equal to 6 percent of their assets or twice the amount of their capital The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had wanted to require S & amp; Ls to sell their junk bonds within two years, while the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill has a more liberal junk bond limit of 11 percent of assets. _ Acceptance, with modification, of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> provisions requiring the S & amp; L industry-owned <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION> to subsidize housing for poor people and forcing banks and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls to disclose their record of serving poor and minority people _ Adoption of a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> clause guaranteeing <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> the right to serve the two years remaining in his term The offer also retains Wall's authority over state-chartered S & amp; Ls. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had wanted to transfer that authority to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> complained that the offer was too vague and amounted to little more than a letter of intent He told reporters that the senators, by proceeding with a broad offer rather than sticking to the conference agenda, may wind up delaying ultimate enactment of the bill. In a 6 -LCB- - hour session Tuesday, legislators agreed to raise civil and criminal fines for bank and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L fraud to a maximum of $ 1 million a day and the maximum jail term to five years

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar started higher at the start of Friday's trading, while share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> rebounded slightly from Thursday's close. The dollar opened at 139.60 yen, up 0.55 yen from Thursday's close of 139.05 yen In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it ended at 139.50 yen overnight. Trading was quiet as dealers waited for the release of major <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> economic indicators later Friday, including the nation's wholesale price index for June, traders said. The market expects the index to be only slighty lower than the previous month, said a Bank of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> trader, speaking on condition of anonymity. A lower figure would mean inflation is slowing. `` If the figure is larger than our expectation, it could be a major dollar-buying incentive,'' he said. `` Considering the dollar is not declining now despite our expectation for quite some time over the possible relaxation of monetary policy, I see little incentive for further dollar-selling,'' the trader added.

<TEXT>
 The developer of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>' upscale Galleria shopping and office complex announced plans Thursday to build a signature office tower for <ORGANIZATION> Oryx </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the city's first major skyscraper construction in several years. The announcement of the 26 - to 28-story building does not necessarily mean the city's lagging real estate market has recovered, analysts said, but nevertheless is welcome `` I do n't think it signals a turnaround; it signals a situation where you had a large user with a specific need,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Katopody </PERSON>, a partner in the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION> Kenneth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leventhal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> accountants. He said there is a two-year supply of office space already built, with about a one-year inventory of Class A space. Neither will the tower add to downtown's distinctive skyline, as it will be built about seven miles north of the central business district near the intersection of two major highways. The building will be part of the Galleria complex, which includes two office towers _ one of 24 stories and one of 25 _ a <LOCATION> Westin </LOCATION> hotel and a four-story shopping mall. The complex was built by <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hines </PERSON> Interests. Nearby is the 24-story Occidental Tower, headquarters of <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Staman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON>, executive vice president of <PERSON> Hines </PERSON>, refused to discuss the building's cost, but analysts said it could run as high as $ 200 a square foot, or about $ 118 million for the 590,000 square feet Construction will begin after the first of the year, with <ORGANIZATION> Oryx </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest independent oil company, moving in by the end of 1991, <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON> said. Neither he nor the company would disclose leasing or equity arrangements, and <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON> said the company still is pursuing financing. He said many financiers were surprised when contacted about new construction in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, but <ORGANIZATION> Oryx </ORGANIZATION>' long-term lease commitment makes the project `` a very ` financiable' undertaking.'' The Oryx headquarters had been a hotly contested prize in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>' hungry real estate community But company officials said there just was n't enough quality space in one place, despite millions of empty square feet available. `` We wanted a building where we would be the only tenant, or at least the major tenant,'' <ORGANIZATION> Oryx </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauptfuhrer </PERSON> said. `` We want to establish a definite identity and presence in the business community, so a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> location that will be recognized by all as the <ORGANIZATION> Oryx </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION> was a major consideration.'' <ORGANIZATION> Oryx </ORGANIZATION> will move about 1,000 of its employees into the new building from two locations elsewhere in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Oryx </ORGANIZATION> formerly was known as <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exploration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> before it was spun off last year by parent <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which kept the retailing and refining end of the business. The last major skyscraper built in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> was <ORGANIZATION> Cityplace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a 42-story building announced in 1984 and completed last year. It remains about half empty, occupied mainly by builder <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain. Most of the city's other towers were finished by 1987 and none are currently under construction.

 A federal judge Thursday denied a request by an Italian company to block a <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> order that is forcing the firm to sell a huge quantity of soybean futures. The lawsuit filed by <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, both subsidiaries of <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finanziara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION>, sought the restraining order and a permanent injunction against the exchange's directive. Published reports have said the firm was the object of the directive because it was trying to corner the soybean market _ something <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen deny. The lawsuit claimed <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> had been irreparably injured by the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>'s order, which it said would diminish confidence in the market and hurt <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farmers. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Zagel </PERSON>, who denied the request for a temporary injunction, said blocking the <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION>'s order could cause harm to the public. `` The preservation of procedures adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> is in the interest of the public,'' <PERSON> Zagel </PERSON> said in issuing his late-afternoon decision. <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION>'s attorney, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, said he did not know whether the Italian firm would pursue the lawsuit or seek monetary damages. <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Karsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> praised the decision. He told a news conference late Thursday that there were over 40 million July soybean contracts open and abnormally low levels of stocks available to satisfy the contracts _ which would have resulted in a number of defaults without the exchange's order. He said the exchange's business conduct committee tried to promote the orderly liquidation of the contracts, but not enough market participants responded. During the hearing before <PERSON> Zagel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said the emergency order forced the Italian firm to reduce its holdings of July soybean contracts by 20 percent on Wednesday and another 20 percent Thursday. He said the order `` did irreparable damage to <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Angle </PERSON> said the exchange had entered into discussions with <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> officials and had asked them to reduce their futures contracts, but they refused to comply. <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON> said previously the exchange would `` vigorously'' fight the lawsuit. Soybean futures prices rose sharply Thursday in reaction to news of the lawsuit. Soybeans for delivery in July settled at $ 6.97 -LCB- a bushel, 11 cents above the previous day's settlement. The July contract skidded 39 -LCB- cents on Wednesday. In two related developments, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soybean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> called for an investigation of the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>'s directive and the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> agriculture commissioner asked the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to check whether <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> officials may have benefited from the effects of the order. The Board of Trade, the world's largest market for grain and soybean futures, issued the emergency order Tuesday requiring any player holding obligations to receive or deliver more than 3 million bushels of soybeans for July delivery to reduce those holdings to 1 million bushels by the end of trading Thursday, when the July contract expires. <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION>'s lawsuit said the company holds obligations to take delivery of 23 million bushels of soybeans. <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> also is believed to own a large quantity of physical soybeans. If it does not reduce its position in the futures market, <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> theoretically could force those on the other end of its futures contracts to deliver, possibly causing a scramble for supplies that would drive the price of its soybeans up sharply. <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> has said it accumulated large soybean supplies to keep its processing plants running and to meet export commitments, and that its large futures market position was a hedge against price fluctuations. <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON> said the exchange's board of directors issued its order because it appeared there might not be enough deliverable soybeans available to satisfy all the contracts. The Board of Trade did not mention <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> in its order and has refused to further explain the reasons for its decision. However, rumors among market watchers have pointed to <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION>. In issuing the order, the exchange cited federal regulations that allow it take such action to ensure the orderly expiration of a futures contract. The <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soybean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> urged the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> to fully explain the reasons behind its order to soybean producers and processors, and saying failure to do so would be `` another blow to the credibility of the board.'' <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> on Wednesday asked the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to investigate whether any Board of Trade officials benefited from the emergency order. In a letter to <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said it was possible that some <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION> board members who made the order held short positions _ obligations to sell soybeans _ and benefited from the price drop following the order. Exchange spokesmen would not comment on the developments. But an exchange official who spoke on the condition of anonymity dismissed as sour grapes the complaints of traders who ended up on the losing side of Wednesday's dizzying drop in soybean prices. `` Any time you have any sort of order affecting the market you're going to have someone complaining about it,'' he said `` Someone is always on the other side.'' Some traders said the exchange should have left the market alone to sort itself out. Others said the emergency order spawned confusion and public mistrust at time when the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>'s image has been tarnished by a federal investigation of suspected trading fraud Exchange member <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Merritt </PERSON>, a 22-year veteran of the grain pits, said soybean farmers _ a group the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> has been wooing for years _ felt betrayed. `` They feel like, why should they try to legitimately hedge when the sanctity of the contracts are being questioned,'' said <PERSON> Merritt </PERSON>, research director for <ORGANIZATION> Merchants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` They're having second thoughts about this right now and I think I probably speak for the entire brokerage community in saying that it's become quite an emotional issue.''
