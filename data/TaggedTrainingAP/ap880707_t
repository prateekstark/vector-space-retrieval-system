 A three-story department store crowded with people seeking shelter from torrential rains collapsed Thursday, killing at least eight people, injuring more than 40 and trapping others in the rubble, authorities said. `` It looks real bad,'' <LOCATION> Cameron </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said of the scene in the downtown area of this city across the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` It's a disaster. It was just like a bomb hit that corner store there.'' The roof and front wall of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tienda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amigo </LOCATION>, known as the <ORGANIZATION> Amigo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION>, caved in at about 2:20 p.m. CDT. Emergency crews using portable lights continued into the night digging through mounds of broken cinderblocks, glass, twisted steel and merchandise to pull out survivors and look for victims. `` They thought they heard some voices and that's where they're digging now,'' city spokeswoman <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Downing </PERSON> said about 10 p.m. Rescuers cut through a wall inside a <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION>'s store next door to reach some of those trapped Witnesses said they heard screams from the wreckage. Linens and clothing blown from the store by high winds were being used to wrap the wounds of the injured. Police Sgt. Dean <PERSON> Poos </PERSON> said shortly after 7 p.m. that `` we do n't really think there are going to be any more live people coming out of there. Ambulances and rescue personnel were hampered in reaching the scene by floodwaters from the downpour. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgibbons </PERSON>, acting assistant city manager, said some local businesses had volunteered front-end loaders and cranes to help. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the collapse could have been caused by the weight of the rainwater, which dumped more than 2 inches in less than 30 minutes. The store was half a block from the international bridge, and sheriff's Lt. <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> said that when the storm began, a large number of Mexican nationals `` were running there to get out of the rain. The store was packed.'' <PERSON> Poos </PERSON> said store owner <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> told him that when the roof collapsed, `` he jumped under a table, and all he knows is that when everything settled, he looked up and there was blue sky above him.'' <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said he escaped with three employees and three customers. <PERSON> Poos </PERSON> said six bodies had been removed from the rubble and identified, and <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Economedes </PERSON>, head of one rescue team, said workers had found two more bodies. `` They've got two steel beams across them and about 20 or 30 tons of concrete'' on them, <PERSON> Economedes </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Poos </PERSON> said eight people were admitted to hospitals and another 34 were treated at three hospitals in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> and nearby <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Benito </LOCATION>. Authorities said they could only guess at the number of people who might have been trapped inside. <PERSON> Poos </PERSON> estimated it would be no more than 50 and <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> speculated it could be as many as 125. <PERSON> Poos </PERSON> said the dead included a woman who was apparently crushed as she sat in a car with Mexican license plates in front of the building. Two others were killed as they stood under a canopy in front of the store. `` All of a sudden, I hear a noise kind of like a boom and I was looking directly at the store and I see this tan-colored, sandy-colored wall that filled the whole front of the store,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Brownsville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> photographer who was shooting weather photos in front of the store when the roof collapsed. `` It was coming forward, then the windows, the entire storefront, the windows just exploded out,'' he said. `` Glass just went out. People just went like this, covered their heads, kind of ducked down, and in the next instant, the whole thing just came down. `` The people I had been looking at were just covered with rubble,'' he said, adding one woman's hand was pinned to a parking meter after a steel I-beam collapsed and left her surrounded with cinder blocks. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Border Patrol officials and other law enforcement agencies, including Mexican authorities, assisted in the rescue operation. An emergency treatment center was set up at a civic center about two blocks away and authorities blocked off the area. A meteorologist with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> who asked not to be identified said that in the kind of storm that hit the area, `` the drops are very large and very heavy, and the fact that the storm system was n't moving very fast _ only about 10 miles an hour _ can cause heavy flooding.''

 A federal official warned Thursday that two more months of drought could close plants along three rivers in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, as temperature records continued to fall, and circus elephants were taken to a river to cool off in 101-degree <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. One official in drought-stricken <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> warned Thursday of likely statewide water restrictions. Low water again kept barges from moving on the lower <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and part of the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> was closed. An official of the <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> said the river dipped closer Wednesday to a level that would trigger a recommendation to divert water from lakes in northern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON>, upon returning from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Thursday night, said he persuaded <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> to allow farmers to donate their hay on Conservation Reserve Program land without forfeiting any of their payment's under it `` This is a very critical time for livestock and dairy farmers. These people are on the verge of bankruptcy,'' <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> said at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport `` But it wo n't work unless we get the farmers to donate the hay and the private and commercial truckers to donate the transportation. I'll contribute my time and drive one of those trucks.'' Private crop analyst <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Leslie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analytical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> said corn yields from irrigated fields of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> could be good, but some other fields in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> already are `` beyond recovery.'' `` This is a disaster under development,'' said <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON>. `` We're in uncharted waters The great difficulty is that we do n't know what the moisture situation will be a year from now and whether we can make a recovery.'' Rain fell on some dry sections of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> officials declared a statewide drought watch Thursday, triggering voluntary reductions in water use and a ban on open fires in state parks and forests. Temperatures hit record highs for the date Thursday in at least 28 cities from the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, including 102 at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s high of 100 degrees toppled a record that had been on the books since 1874, when thermometers reached 97. In the normally cool mountains of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Elkins </ORGANIZATION> hit a record 93, the ninth record temperature there since June 1. The temperature at <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> hit a record 101 degrees and four elephants from the <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> Temple Shrine Circus were taken to the <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> for a cooling wallow. Only one of the animals, natives of hot climates, got in and rolled around in the water. The drought also knocked the steam out of the annual railroad journey transporting vintage, restored circus wagons to <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> for the city's Circus Parade. Officials said Thursday that the steam locomotive used to pull the train wo n't make the run this year because of the danger of setting track-side fires from sparks. Salt concentrations in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> water climbed higher Thursday at drinking water intakes of the nearest downriver suburb of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, and officials of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION> began reserving barges to float in fresh water. The river's reduced flow is not strong enough to push the dense salt water back into the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Lower Plaquemines Parish is already bringing fresh water by barge to mix with the salty flow at its intakes 30 miles downriver from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. The salt concentration there is already strong enough to taste. A continuation of the drought for two more months could threaten municipal water supplies and close plants along three major rivers in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, deputy district engineer for the Corps' Mobile District, addressed a drought management meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drought </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, made up of the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, the three states and other organizations. The committee announced that navigation on <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Apalachicola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> would virtually end on July 13 because of low water. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> referred to both plants that use water to run turbines and generate electricity and those that use water for industrial purposes, such as rinsing textiles and cooling machinery. The lack of rain already has forced <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> to shut down nearly all hydroelectric production and have coal-burning plants make up the difference. The <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> remained closed at <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, about 20 miles south of <LOCATION> Natchez </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, where water had been as low as five feet. `` Hopefully by this weekend we will have the river open if somebody does n't mess up,'' L.C. Fumbanks, chief of navigation for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>, said in a radio-telephone interview from aboard the dredge <PERSON> Jadwin </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Jadwin </PERSON> worked south of <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, where traffic resumed Wednesday, while another dredge pumped sand from the blockage at <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> decided Thursday to close the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Mound </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, for 12-hour shifts to clear a build-up of sand and silt from the channel, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. j.g. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON>. He said the affected two-mile stretch would be opened for six hours Friday morning, closed for 12 hours, then reopened for six hours. `` It will just alternate back and forth like that until they get it cleared through,'' <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON> said, adding that he had no estimate how long that would take. Traffic on the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> is normal, although barges are carrying lighter loads, thanks to reservoirs upstream, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, director of public affairs for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, Neb. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said Thursday that voluntary water conservation measures are not working. `` Most of the cities we're checking with regularly indicate the program is not paying dividends,'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>. `` My guess is that if the drought continues for another two weeks to 30 days, we're going to need -LRB- statewide -RRB- mandatory water restrictions.'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> made his remarks before leaving for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where he, like <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> and officials from seven states met with <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shank </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, has asked the state's 2,500 largest water systems to aim for a a minimum 25 percent reduction in water use by all customers, and some cities have already banned lawn sprinkling. <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> fined <LOCATION> Gwinnett </LOCATION> and Cobb counties $ 75,000 each Wednesday for taking too much water in June and told them they must cut consumption, possibly including round-the-clock bans on outdoor water use. Up to 1.5 inches of rain fell on parts of west-central and northern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> late Wednesday and early Thursday, somewhat easing drought conditions, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said today. `` Every little bit helps,'' said <LOCATION> Clay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> extension agent <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernhardson </PERSON>. However, he added: `` the rain's been really limited in most areas of the county, and high temperatures are complicating'' the situation. Wheat, <LOCATION> Clay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s biggest crop, `` is getting to the point where in some areas they'll get 8 to 10 bushels an acre maximum'' compared to a normal average of 40 to 50 bushels, he said. Approximately 545 bales of hay from <ORGANIZATION> Elon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, arrived Thursday at <LOCATION> Shelbyville </LOCATION>, Ky. It was a `` gesture of thanks'' for the 2,300 tons of hay <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> farmers sent by train to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> two years ago, said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Nesbitt </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. `` I gave about 50 bales two years ago. Now it's my turn to receive,'' said O.L. <PERSON> Jeffries </PERSON>, who farms near <LOCATION> Shelbyville </LOCATION>. `` I do n't know which way to turn. It's pitiful.''

 Rescuers on Thursday night found two more survivors of an explosion and towering fire that consumed the <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> platform and killed up to 166 people in the world's worst oil rig disaster The search was suspended for the night, to resume at daylight Friday. But authorities said there was little hope of finding anyone else alive in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>'s frigid waters. The <LOCATION> Piper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alpha </LOCATION> oil rig, 120 miles off <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, is owned by <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION>. A joint statement issued by <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathys </PERSON> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and police in <LOCATION> Aberdeen </LOCATION> at 4:15 a.m. Friday -LRB- 11:15 p.m. EDT Thursday -RRB- said: `` In all, 230 personnel were involved in the incident. This was made up of 227 on Occidental facilities and three in a small rescue boat. Seventeen bodies have been recovered. Total survivors to date are 64, and 149 are unaccounted for.'' Those numbers tooks into account body recovered early Friday. <PERSON> Mathys </PERSON> said initial confusion as to the number of survivors resulted in earlier discrepancies in the figures. Asked whether rescuers had given up hope of finding more survivors, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> minister <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said: `` To be honest, yes. At this stage there is very little hope indeed.'' The rig owners said the probable cause of the conflagration was a gas leak, which a survivor said was `` screaming like a banshee'' seconds before the blast Wednesday night. Survivors told of having to choose between trying to survive the flames in hopes aid would come and plunging 150 feet into a blanket of burning oil that covered water cold enough to kill. `` It was a case of fry and die or jump and try,'' said <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON>, 45, who jumped. Rescue pilots described flames up to 400 feet high. The fire still flickered nearly 24 hours later. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government promised `` a very, very deep and far-reaching inquiry.'' Questions arose about safety stadards in the high-risk industry, and opposition politicians claimed safety was neglected. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> said it believed a gas leak was to blame, but days or weeks would be needed to determine what caused and ignited it. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> said the three-quarters of the 649-foot-high rig was destroyed. <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON>, a 45-year-old rigger, said he was in a workshop near the control center when he heard the scream of `` two gas leaks almost simultaneously, and about 30 seconds later there was the first explosion. It wiped out the control room and that was it. Our nerve center was gone.'' <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Sneddon </PERSON>, a university lecturer on offshore engineering in <LOCATION> Aberdeen </LOCATION>, said: `` We can only assume there was a leak of some sort. Basically, you are sitting on top of two highly flammable products _ oil and gas. A leak or a spill is a potential hazard. It is extremely difficult to say what could have set it off.'' The number of men still missing and the dim prospects for finding them alive seem certain to make the <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> explosion the worst oil rig disaster, surpassing the 123 deaths when the <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kielland </PERSON> platform capsized in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> waters in March 1980. Police said the overwhelming majority of those on the <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> were Scottish, but the domestic <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> news </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said workers from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, continental <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> also were aboard. Authorities said no list of dead would be released until families were notified. Six <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> warships, led by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> destroyer Hayler, diverted from maneuvers to join a multinational flotilla of rescue vessels. Helicopters criss-crossed the smoke-filled skies. <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION>, said he would leave immediately for <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION> to oversee care the care of injured workers and families of the missing, said spokesman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillot </PERSON> at the company's <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> headquarters. Survivors were taken to <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION> Royal Infirmary and officials said 20 were hospitalized, most with burns. Distraught families clustered outside waiting for news of loved ones. <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> insisted safety standards were strict, including week-long government inspections annually. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> inspection took place two weeks ago. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> claimed in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> that rig inspection and maintenance had been reduced in recent years, too little money was spent on training, and health and safety legislation did not apply fully to the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil and gas industry. In reply, <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> said serious <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> accidents had fallen from 101 in 1986 to 59 last year. He added: `` That is too high a figure and we wish to keep the pressure on to ensure that improvement is maintained.'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Cryer </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> said an explosion on the <LOCATION> Piper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alpha </LOCATION> four years ago slightly injured four men, and claimed the investigators' report was kept secret Parkinson's department said the report was not published because investigators found no negligence and did not recommend prosecutions. The disaster Wednesday night began at about 9.30 p.m., just after a 12-hour shift had ended, and many of the men were in bed. `` I was just going to bed and there was a bang,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>, 38. `` They came in and said there was a fire and to get out. The sprinklers were on. We could see them, but there was n't sufficient volume to put down the fire. Rigger <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinnett </PERSON>, watching from a supply vessel, told the <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evening </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>: `` It was like the platform had been hit by an atomic bomb. There was massive mushrooms and flames shooting into the air. I just thanked God I was n't on board.''

 Senators are weighing in with their favorite candidates for attorney general, while the man who's leaving the job predicts his successor will not be `` a clone of anybody else.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> launched his search Wednesday for <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'s replacement and one of his first steps in the process was to meet with the departing attorney general. A lightning rod of controversy because of his conservative policies and his personal legal problems, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> announced Tuesday he would be gone in a few weeks. He declared himself vindicated by an 830-page report on his official conduct compiled by independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, although he acknowledged he had not yet seen it. The report has not been released by a special federal court. While sources have said the report recommends against a criminal indictment, its conclusions on <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s ethical conduct remain unclear. While no names of possible successors were volunteered at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, senators made sure that a steady list of possibilities kept drifting from <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> to the White House. Some lawmakers made telephone calls to administration officials. Others allowed their message to be carried by news reporters. All agreed that the window for confirmation would be short. Majority Democrats control the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> schedule. Recesses already are scheduled during the two national political conventions in July and August, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> might adjourn early during the presidential campaign. Two members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, ranking Republican <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> and <PERSON> Democrat </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, suggested former Republican Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> as <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s successor. <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> was considered the president's closest <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ally before retiring. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Loranger </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON>, quoted the former senator as saying, `` There is absolutely no truth to the rumors about my going to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.''' <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON>'s secretary at his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> law office, <PERSON> Janene </PERSON> <PERSON> Assuras </PERSON>, said her boss was `` not interested'' in the job, but did n't know what he would do if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asked. <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, also recommended former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> from his home state. <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, also had other suggestions: former Democratic Attorney General <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> B. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, who served under <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first attorney general, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>.

White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> conceded that administration officials had no contingency plan to find a replacement, even though <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> indicated some time ago he might leave before the end of the administration. `` We had an attorney general up until yesterday,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` We do n't compile lists for positions where they're already filled.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> had said earlier that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` some time ago that he might want to leave before the end of the administration. The president left the timing up to him.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` briefly discussed'' a successor for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> with White House chief of staff <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON> and general counsel A.B. <PERSON> Culvahouse </PERSON>, the spokesman said. If a new attorney general has not been confirmed by the time <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> leaves, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, the administration probably would install Solicitor General Charles Fried in the job on an acting basis.

<HEAD>No Big Jump In Food Prices, Ag Official Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Increases in food prices should remain moderate this year despite the drought as the nation begins to draw on its large grain reserves, says the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s top economist. `` The immediate problem is not one of food shortage or food price inflation, except in certain specific instances, but rather the problem is one of responding in a compassionate way to the losses faced by American farmers,'' Assistant Secretary of Agriculture <PERSON> Ewen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said Wednesday. Appearing before three <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittees, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> forecast tight supplies of soybeans and oats. He also acknowledged that while the winter wheat harvest is actually ahead of schedule, there has been severe damage to spring wheat and much of the corn crop is in bad shape. He said, however, that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soybeans will be available to meet <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> needs and added that reserves of wheat and feed grains are ample to ensure that Americans will not have to endure any calamitous food shortage. The testimony came as <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> began to focus more intently on food prices, with lawmakers saying there was no immediate reason to warrant major increases. Rep. <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>, called on the congressional <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> to monitor food prices in the next six months. He expressed concern that food processors and others might engage in `` price gouging.'' `` It simply would n't wash with economic reality to cite the drought as a reason for a quick runup of food prices,'' he said in a statement. `` It would be inexcusable for any company to use the drought as a way to make a quick buck.'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> did say that prolonged drought would send wheat prices higher, guaranteeing `` some additional pressure on retail prices of bakery products and cereals'' but not a major increase. He said, however, that farm-level prices account for only 8 percent of the retail value of cereal and bakery products. `` If wheat prices for the entire season average 30 percent above last year, this alone would translate into a 2.4 percent rise in the retail price of bakery and cereal products,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. He said any increases would be `` moderate'' in scale. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said that while no major shortages were in sight, there could be a squeeze in the supply of some crops. He also said grazing conditions on June 1 were rated 68 percent of ideal and that hay prices are up 22 percent from last year. But 65 percent of the winter wheat crop, which amounts to three-quarters of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat production, already has been harvested and progress is `` well ahead of normal,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. In contrast, `` the spring wheat crop is in bad shape with almost two-thirds of the crop rated in poor to very poor condition due to the drought,'' he said. Wheat reserves at the start of the year totaled 1.27 billion bushels, well above the average of the last decade, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. He said that amount plus winter wheat already in the bins from the current harvest add up to a 10-month supply. That includes wheat for export, he said. The greatest production loss is in durum wheat, which is used for pasta, he said. The condition of hard red spring wheat also is generally poor, but stocks equal to 80 percent of annual use are available, he said. Turning to feed grains, he said, corn is generally in fair condition. In 10 of the 17 major producing states, 25 percent or more of the crop is rated poor or very poor, he said. In six of the 11 major sorghum-producing states, at least 25 percent of sorghum acreage is rated poor or very poor, he said. There are no weekly reports on the condition of oats and barley, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. But he noted that more than half the nation's barley and one-third of its oats come from the Grain Belt where the drought is worst. Nonetheless, corn stocks on hand as of Sept. 1 are projected to equal 50 percent of annual use and sorghum stocks 90 percent of annual use. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said corn supply should be ample to prevent any serious shortage. `` Even with a very pessimistic scenario you end up with a carryover of a billion bushels,'' he said. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said the soybean crop is generally rated fair to poor. In 11 of the 19 major producing states, `` anywhere from one-fourth to more than one-half of the crop is rated poor or worse,'' he said.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is calling for a period of mourning for the victims of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missile attack on an Iranian jetliner, and urging the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to pay reparations to the victims' families. He also criticized Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for statements the likely Republican nominee made this week in response to the deaths of 290 people in the downing of the Iranian commercial jet. `` I thought it was a bit in bad taste, if not downright vulgar, to be running around on July 4, getting applause lines, talking about the honor of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, as if it were in question, and not expressing the profound sense of humanity that the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people have and our sense of sharing the grief of the tragedy,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expressed his deep regrets on Monday as he campaigned through the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, saying, `` Obviously, as we celebrate our great national holiday our hearts go out to the loved ones and families of those who were lost and also -LRB- hearts -RRB- go out to those kids, those young Americans who are defending freedom halfway around the world.'' However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said he could identify with the captain of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> cruiser, who made the decision to fire because he believed his ship was in danger. And <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he did not believe <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in the region would change as a result of the incident. `` Life goes on,' the vice president said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who met with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, emphasized that the downing of the Iranian plane was `` an accident, an error ... No one assumes that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is without compassion, that it moved to engage in an act of war.'' `` We should say to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> that we sincerely regret the accident occurred, that we offer reparations or compensation to the families of the victims, if they will accept them,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, repeating a call he made over the holiday weekend in the wake of the incident. At the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> met with envoys of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, including <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Djibouti </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, Democratic <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>. He repeated his plea for the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages and all other captives in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also said he favored a new international naval peacekeeping force in the gulf. `` I hope the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> will hav a much more prominent rule in the gulf in the future,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. Earlier, when asked if he had any interest in becoming <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> replied, `` None whatsoever.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Faces Deficit and Confidence Problems at Home</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has been highly critical of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> adminsitration's deficit spending in his Democratic presidential campaign, has a deficit problem of his own. Two weeks before his certain selection as the Democratic presidential nominee, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor faces a $ 450 million deficit on an $ 11 billion budget in the just-ended fiscal year and has yet to sign a budget for the new one. And according to a new poll, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's favorability rating is declining _ although residents of his home state still heavily favor him over Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides insist that the budget problems will be resolved in short order and that the governor's home-state popularity will rebound. But the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign is already making the fiscal woes into a campaign issue. `` It could turn out to be the Achilles heel of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> presidential campaign,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cellucci </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> coordinator for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. The state government's new fiscal year began last Friday, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has yet to close a $ 450 million deficit for last year and still must shepherd a 1989 budget to his desk. Faced with an unexpected revenue shortfall, the governor is scaling back his spending plans and pushing for a package of narrowly targeted tax and fee increases. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was forced to ask the Legislature for $ 81 million in emergency spending authority to avoid having to renege on the state payroll and welfare checks. The House approved the measure. `` The putting together of budgets is not a pleasant process to watch _ never has been, never will be,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVillars </PERSON>, the governor's deputy chief secretary. `` There is obviously a great deal more attention to the process this year, in part because of unanticipated events that have led to less revenue than expected and in part because the chief executive is running for national office.'' According to a telephone survey last week of 400 likely <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> voters, 56 percent said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has not been an effective governor while campaigning for president and 47 percent said he should resign now or immediately after the Democratic convention July 18-21. In addition, the governor's unfavorable rating has more than doubled _ to 36 percent _ since a similar poll in January 1987, before <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> declared his intention to run. His favorable rating dropped from 71 percent to 55 percent. Still, the survey said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was favored over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 51 percent to 37 percent. The poll was conducted for <ORGANIZATION> WBZ-TV </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> KRC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> DeVillars </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has devoted well over 100 hours in recent weeks to the state's budget problems while at the same time focusing on the selection of a vice presidential running mate. But he has not dominated the budget process as he has in past years. Based on June tax collections, the government is technically about $ 450 million in deficit for fiscal 1988, according to legislative leaders. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has offered a 20-point program to close that gap through bookkeeping changes and borrowing, but the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has balked at several unpopular features. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his legislative allies argue that the deficit was the unforseeable result of a downturn in income tax receipts combined with $ 92 million in court-ordered corporate tax abatements. At the same time, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been forced to retreat from the $ 12 billion spending goal for fiscal 1989 that he announced in January, and he has agreed with top <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers to reduce the spending target. A conference committee negotiated a compromise late Wednesday of $ 11.75 billion, which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is expected to sign next week. A principal sticking point has been nervousness about revenues for the coming year. After five years of double-digit revenue growth, tax collections fell nearly flat last year. Nevertheless, the administration projects a comeback in fiscal 1989 of 12 percent, a figure that many legislators question. In order to buttress revenues, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has turned to taxes. He recently signed a $ 40 million tax on cigarettes, and more than $ 200 million in other new taxes are moving toward his desk. One would raise personal taxes on the wealthy by bringing the state code back into conformance with federal law, another would end a corporate loophole that allows multistate companies to write off their out-of-state losses, and a third would capture some $ 24 million a year in unclaimed bottle deposits that now stay in the hands of bottlers. <PERSON> Cellucci </PERSON> blames <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for over-spending during his second term. `` You ca n't have budgets that rise at twice the rate of inflation and add 10,000 new state employees and not have a day of reckoning. This is the day of reckoning that they're trying to postpone until after November.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s pollster says <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> is `` far and away'' the strongest choice for the Democratic vice presidential nomination. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirthlin </PERSON>, more accustomed to giving advice to Republicans than to Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, told reporters at a luncheon Wednesday that <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> would help <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` play the patriotic theme'' in the general election campaign. He contended the question of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential choice was less clear for Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Among the prospects he cited were Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and his wife, former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, as well as Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and former Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wirthlin </PERSON>, who has done polling for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for more than 20 years, worked for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> during the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator's unsuccessful bid for the 1988 GOP presidential nomination. He said he thought <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> would help <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> farm belt and among blue collar workers. But he conceded that <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s acerbic personality could be damaging if he went on the attack. <PERSON> Wirthlin </PERSON> also said he thought it would be a mistake to have President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on the stump attacking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` People do not approve of an incumbent president attacking a candidate trying to succeed him,'' he said. In addition, he said, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` is not a good attack candidate.'' <PERSON> Wirthlin </PERSON> also said the resignation of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> does n't erase the `` sleaze factor'' for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the fall presidential campaign, but makes it easier for him to deal with it. During a luncheon session with reporters, <PERSON> Wirthlin </PERSON> said only about 3 percent of the voters he has surveyed cite ethics in government as the most important issue, a figure that is no higher than a year earlier. The issue that outstrips all others in importance in the minds of voters is drugs, said the pollster. `` There are now 21 percent who tag drugs as the single most important problem facing the nation,'' he said. No other issue was named by more than 10 percent of people interviewed. While <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was under investigation by independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was peppered with questions about whether he thought the attorney general should resign. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides at one point described <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> as a `` liability,'' a description the vice president disavowed. <PERSON> Wirthlin </PERSON> said the departure of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> would put the ethics issue `` in a different context'' and would `` enable <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to talk about ethics without implicitly criticizing <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>.''

<HEAD>Demonstrators of All Stripes Get Soapbox Time At The Convention</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 When the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> opens here this month, protesters from animal rights activists to AIDS victims will be on hand to try to grab a bit of the spotlight. But convention organizers, who carefully orchestrate many of the events inside the convention hall, are also seeking to bring order to what could otherwise be a chaotic crush of demonstrations. The city is supplying a stage across the street from the convention site that will serve as a soapbox for a variety of causes. Protesters are being offered two-hour time slots over five days to air their views. The city will provide a stage and sound equipment in the lot, which authorities estimate can hold about 30,000 people. The demonstrators will be within sight and earshot of the delegates as they arrive and depart during the gathering July 15-18. However, the plan is being challenged in federal court by a coalition of groups seeking expanded space for demonstrations. A decision was possible as early as today. Generally, potentially antagonistic groups have not been scheduled together, although a gay rights group follows a white supremacist organization onto the stage one afternoon. By Wednesday, 25 of the 40 slots were filled, four of them by one organization, the Committee for Fair Elections. At least four other groups with ties to that committee also have reserved time. The group is the vehicle for the independent presidential campaign of <PERSON> Leonora </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulani </PERSON>, who says she will bring 10,000 backers to the convention. She has qualified for the ballot in all 50 states and is eligible for federal matching funds. Demonstrations coinciding with those on the stage supplied by the city will be permitted in the parking lot, but their organizers can not use powerful sound equipment. Local organizations with demonstration time include a neighborhood group that opposes the construction of a domed stadium in the neighborhood near the convention site. The Nationalist Movement, a Mississippi-based white supremacy group, has been given a parade permit and a two-hour slot on Sunday afternoon in conjunction with its annual convention. Other groups given protest time in the parking lot include: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, a liberal Washington-based foreign policy lobby. _ No Business As Usual, which opposes the Strategic Defense Initiative, known as Star Wars. _ Disabled In Action, a group advocating better access for the handicapped, which has ties to the <PERSON> Fulani </PERSON> campaign. _ <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-Congo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friendship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which opposes the regime of President <PERSON> Mobuto </PERSON> Sese Seko of <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. _ Rep. <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> congressman from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. _ <ORGANIZATION> Castillo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> City-based performing arts group specializing in working-class history and progressive politics. _ The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, N.Y.-based pro-Fulani organization. _ People With AIDS Coalition and March on AIDS. _ <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pluribus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unum </ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> artist and activist group specializing in liberal political performances. _ Compassion Campaign ` 88, an animal rights organization. _ LEGAL, a national gay rights organization. _ Greater <ORGANIZATION> Lowell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION>, a Massachusetts-based group specializing in hazardous waste issues. _ <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, a former splinter <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> group now run by <PERSON> Fulani </PERSON> backers. _ Prisoners of War @ Missing in Action, which advocates further investigation into cases of servicemen listed as missing from the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war. _ The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, a national group that led the drive to get Ms. <PERSON> Fulani </PERSON>'s name on the ballot.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, resuming his criticism of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration ethical standards, said the nation regained `` a measure of self-respect'' through the resignation of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. But he said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s departure does not change the administration's record of ethical breaches. `` The way to clean up <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is to clean out those people who are indifferent to breaches of the public trust and the public laws,'' the Democratic presidential nominee-to-be told a friendly audience of Greek Americans on Wednesday. `` Yesterday we lost an attorney general, but we gained a measure of self-respect,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, was spending most of today in his Statehouse office before heading West for three days of campaigning. Awaiting his review was a proposed fiscal 1989 budget compromise worked out Wednesday evening by legislators. Passage of that plan would help <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at home, where budget problems have prompted questions about his ability to govern while seeking the White House. It would also make life easier for him on the campaign trail, where he has used competent fiscal management as a selling point. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ended his day Wednesday with a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ecumenical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The presumed Republican nominee, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, was to address the same group today. `` Next year, if all goes well, we're going to have a president who will insist that those who accept the privilege of public service must understand the meaning of public service,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told the group. `` If someone in my administration is caught breaking the law, we wo n't make excuses for him, we'll prosecute him.'' Before that appearance <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> met for more than an hour with 20 national civil rights leaders, including <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> executive director <ORGANIZATION> Benjamin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hooks </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>, the Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Coretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, the widow of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. Several participants described the session as positive and more substantive than a meeting the same group had recently with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` I can not recall an issue he disagreed with us on,'' <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Hugh Hefner's Former Girlfriend Alleges He Supplied Her With Drugs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>'s former girlfriend has accused the <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> founder and celebrity divorce lawyer <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchelson </PERSON> of supplying her with enough drugs to make her an addict. `` -LRB- <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> -RRB- supplied me with almost every drug that I ever took in that house. He had for about two years,'' <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON>, 24, told the television show `` Entertainment Tonight'' in a two-part interview beginning Wednesday. `` I was addicted to pills ... painkillers, sleeping pills, Quaaludes and he had them under lock and key and he supplied me with these pills every day,'' she said. Miss <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> filed a $ 35 million palimony suit against <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> earlier this year, claiming he defrauded and deceived her by allegedly abandoning promises to support her and father a child. She later dropped the lawsuit. `` As the original palimony suit proved, <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> had a very vivid imagination, and whatever she says, should be viewed with a certain amount of skepticism,'' <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` I spent the last three years of the relationship trying to curb her abuse of both drugs and alcohol, and she very well knows it,'' he said of their five-year relationship that ended earlier this year. `` Please remember that I had a stroke in March 1985 that dramatically changed the focus of my life. It ended my use of all recreational drugs.'' In Wednesday's segment, Miss <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Mitchelson </PERSON>, who represented her in the palimony lawsuit, of also supplying drugs and making a pass at her. `` At the time when I started the lawsuit, I was still addicted to some pills and he supplied me with them,'' Miss <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mitchelson </PERSON>, who handled divorces of such celebrities as <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> of `` Dynasty,'' is under investigation by the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> State Bar for alleged misconduct. `` I completely deny all of the allegations. I do n't want to attack <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Mitchelson </PERSON> told the television program. `` She told me during the case I was a wonderful lawyer. For the last 31 years, I've never heard any criticisms like these until recently,'' he said. `` I've spent my life defending women, not attacking them.''

<HEAD>Bush Pledges Hispanic Cabinet Member; Dukakis Finds Some Budget
Relief</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was finding some relief from a politically embarrassing budget crisis in his home state as Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pledged to right `` a wrong that has been out there for many years'' and appoint a Hispanic American to his Cabinet. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, was spending most of today in his Statehouse office before heading West for three days of campaigning. He was preparing to review a proposed fiscal 1989 state budget compromise. <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders agreed late Wednesday on a compromise budget of $ 11.75 billion that would increase state spending by about 4 percent. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was forced to seek emergency spending authority this week to keep government functioning. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> faces a $ 450 million deficit on an $ 11 billion budget in the just-ended fiscal year. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been highly critical of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's deficit spending, and Republicans are planning to make political hay of his troubles `` It could turn out to be the Achilles heel of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> presidential campaign,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cellucci </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> coordinator for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, for his part, continued to attack the ethical standards of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, saying the resignation of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> does not erase the administration's shoddy record. `` If someone in my administration is caught breaking the law, we wo n't make excuses for him, we'll prosecute him,'' he told a friendly audience of Greek Americans in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was traveling to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> tonight to address the same ethnic group at a Greek Orthodox diocesan dinner. Aides said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was going to talk about the importance of religion. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was traveling to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> tonight to address a convention of the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION>, the same group to whom <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised Wednesday he would make a Hispanic appointment. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said after addressing <ORGANIZATION> LULAC </ORGANIZATION>, the largest and oldest Hispanic American civic group, that he would not go around the country making the same promise to other special interest groups. `` Other groups have been represented in the Cabinet and Hispanics have not,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I will be very open-minded and broad-based in who I select to serve in my <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, but I'm addressing myself to righting a wrong that has been out there for many years,'' he said. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>, the group's president, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` attracted the attention of some voters who already decided on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' But <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON>, an influential Democrat in the group, said it was `` a little patronizing'' for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to make such a statement after serving eight years in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration without a Hispanic in the inner circle. Hispanics are a politically important group, especially in key battleground states like <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' command of Spanish gives him an advantage in competing for votes from those groups <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> met for more than an hour Wednesday with 20 national civil rights leaders, including <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> executive director <ORGANIZATION> Benjamin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hooks </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>, the Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Coretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, the widow of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` I can not recall an issue he disagreed with us on,'' <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON> said. But whether blacks will support <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> without <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on the ticket is largely up to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, meanwhile, met with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. Afterward he emphasized that the shooting down of an Iranian passenger jet by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ship in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> was `` an accident, an error.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> called for a period of mourning for the victims of the attack and urged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to pay reparations to the victims' families.

 Public television and cable channels are hoping to lure away network viewers as the lengthy writers strike wears on, delaying the fall season for the networks and the debut of new series. `` I must say, I have mixed emotions -LRB- about the strike -RRB-, because I hate to think about all those writers out of work, so it's nothing to jump up and down about On the other hand, I think it will help us quite a bit,'' said <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Weil </PERSON>, senior vice president of national programming and promotion services for the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The strike, which began March 7, has forced the three major television networks to delay the traditional fall season when they launch new series. The guild rejected the most recent management offer last month. It voted Wednesday night on a model contract for independent producers. Results were to be announced this afternoon. When the strike ends, it will take weeks for producers to prepare new shows. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> is considering buying programs from the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> or re-shooting old TV shows with different actors to avoid reruns. Its `` The Cosby Show'' will continue in production under an independent contract, and it has the Summer Olympics in September. CBS is considering buying <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> shows. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> plans to run the first 18 hours of its 30-hour miniseries `` War and Remembrance'' in November instead of February. PBS is immune from the strike because its programs are produced under a separate contract with the guild, and it also buys British programming. Cable channels that produce first-run programming are affected by the strike, though in most cases the effect has n't been noticed yet. Some first-run cable series, such as Showtime's `` Brothers,'' are at a standstill, just like network shows. Made-for-cable movies for this fall were already written and will go on as scheduled, but the strike had delayed development for next year. In the meantime, cable hopes its documentaries, musical specials and made-for-cable movies that go on this fall as scheduled will lure over some network viewers. Cable and <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION> traditionally pick up viewers during the summer when the networks are in reruns and see a possibility of the seasonal advantage continuing into the fall. For the networks, the loss of viewers this fall could mean increased audience erosion in favor of cable alternatives and videocassettes. `` I think any time the cable networks can inch away a little more viewership, some of the viewership will remain on cable in a longer term,'' said <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Orgel </PERSON>, senior vice president of programming for the <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, which hopes to lure new viewers with sophisticated programming alternatives this fall. At the end of the 1987-88 television season, most major cable channels increased viewership. <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION>, for example, increased 5 percent, while overall network audience levels dropped 9 percent. Some of the drop is attributed to a change in <PERSON> A.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON>'s ratings technology, but the networks agree there is a decrease in network viewing Public television already staggers its series to attract viewers to alternative programming when network shows are repeats. For instance, `` Alive from Off Center,'' an avant-garde variety series, starts its new season on PBS next week. <PERSON> Weil </PERSON> said PBS is not concerned about potential competition if the networks buy <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> shows. She says most Americans are unaware there is plenty of mediocre British television they do n't usually see. But she said if an infusion of foreign product helps raise the level of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television, that's fine, too. `` I never worry about somebody nibbling away at our turf, because I think we should always be moving ahead,'' she said. `` It's going to be a long time before the networks get to ` Alive from Off Center.'''

 A combination of viewers away from their televisions and writers away from their desks handed <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> its lowest prime-time rating ever last week, according to figures from the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The Fourth of July weekend is traditionally a period of low viewing for the networks, but the strike by the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> forced some programs into early reruns and that helped lower <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s average to 8.0, said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wurtzel </PERSON>, vice president for marketing and research. `` It's not only just summer doldrums, but also the fact that the writers' strike has really affected what people are able to see,'' he said. `` We went into a rerun mode earlier than we would have. We've been playing reruns now for an awful long time. `` Believe me, it's not a number anybody is happy about. It's just another reason strikes do n't benefit anybody. For the week ending July 3, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> had a rating of 8.0. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won the week with an 11.7. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> was second with a 9.6. The lowest previous rating for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> was 8.7 two weeks ago and in July 1985. The rating is a percentage of the nation's estimated 88.6 million households with televisions. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s first-run TV movie `` Nightingales'' was the top-rated show of the week and seemingly would have been off to a good start as a summer series, but there are no more episodes of the Aaron Spelling-produced show because of the strike, according to <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. The four-month-long strike has delayed the networks' fall season. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> maintains, however, that the current low viewing levels are typical of summer rerun programming and do not reflect effects of the strike, at least not yet. As a comparison of how low ratings have fallen, `` The Cosby Show,'' the No. 1 show last season, had an season-long average rating of 28.0 compared to 18.9 for `` Nightingales,'' the No. 1 show last week. The rest of the top 10 shows, all reruns, were: `` Night Court,'' `` Cheers,'' `` The Cosby Show,'' `` A Different World,'' `` <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> Law,'' `` Golden Girls'' and `` ALF,'' all <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Who's the Boss?'' on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> Family.'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s first-run summer series `` Hothouse'' premiered to a lowly 6.4 rating and was in 60th place. The lowest-rated prime-time shows of the week were: `` High Mountain Rangers,'' `` Star-Spangled Celebration,'' `` Hothouse,'' `` Sledge Hammer!'' `` CBS Summer Playhouse,'' `` Charmings Special,'' `` Hotel,'' `` Spot Marks the X,'' `` MacGyver,'' `` Rags to Riches,'' `` Supercarrier'' and `` Home Again.'' CBS remained in first place in the close news race, finishing the week ending July 1 with an average rating of 9.1 and a share of 20. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> was second with a rating of 8.8 and a 20 share. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> had an 8.4 and 19 share. The share is a percentage of sets in use.

<HEAD>Soviets Say They Crush Protest in Armenia, Deny Deaths</HEAD>

 Soviet authorities acknowledge that paratroopers crushed a protest by thousands of people who shut down a major airport in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. But they deny activists' claims that soldiers killed as many as five protesters. The activists, pushing for annexation of a predominantly Armenian region of the neighboring republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, charged Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops killed demonstrators at the airport in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the Armenian capital. The latest round of protests began Monday with a general strike and intensified Tuesday night with the airport clash, officials and Armenian activists said. On Wednesday, the situation did not appear to be stabilizing. The evening television news program `` Vremya'' said hundreds of thousands of Armenians thronged <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>'s streets as the strike continued. The government daily <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said mass transit was still shut down and the situation had worsened since Tuesday, when 26 factories and economic agencies in the southern republic were idled. Since February, <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> has been the scene of massive demonstrations by Armenians demanding annexation of the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. Until now, the protests had reportedly been peaceful. On Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Perfilyev </PERSON> told a news conference `` the rumors that Armenians were killed are groundless.'' But he acknowledged that Soviet troops late Tuesday routed about 2,000 people from in and around the Zvartnots Airport. He said 36 people `` had to seek medical assistance'' after the clash. On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said that during a Tuesday rally in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>'s Theater Square, someone began calling for a blockade of the airport and a large column of people headed toward it on foot. Pravda said planes were allowed to land, but demonstrators `` grossly disrupted order'' and prevented them from taking off again. Hundreds of passengers were stranded, it said. `` Vremya'' said 3,000 people took part in the protest and 60 flights were grounded along with 14,000 passengers. <PERSON> Perfilyev </PERSON> said about 400 people occupied the airport's terminal; another 1,500 gathered outside, according to the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency. The demonstrators impeded the sale of tickets and the collection of luggage, entered the landing strip and stopped passengers from coming into the terminal, <PERSON> Perfilyev </PERSON> said. Security troops then moved in to evict the protesters, who began hurling rocks and bottles _ and that's when the 36 casualties occurred, he said. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, Armenian activists said witnesses had telephoned them from <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> to say army troops carrying machine guns and backed by tanks had begun firing without warning on the protesters. `` All of a sudden, they started shooting,'' artist <PERSON> Kuryun </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagapetyan </PERSON> told about 50 people who gathered for a rally outside <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s red-brick Armenian church. `` They were carrying clubs, like policemen in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, and they beat people right and left.'' Three students were killed, he said, and 37 people reportedly were hospitalized. <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Mananikov </PERSON>, an editor of the unofficial <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> journal Glasnost, said at least one man was killed and as many as 40 people wounded by soldiers at the airport. Lev. <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gambaryan </PERSON>, another Armenian who lives in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, told the rally that two children, ages 6 and 10, had also died of gunshot wounds. But he and <PERSON> Nagapetyan </PERSON> said it was not certain whether the two reported deaths were new or among the three previously reported. Ethnic Armenians make up the majority in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. They have long been demanding that the mountainous region be transfered to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> supports the demand, but <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> has rejected it and the issue has gone to officials in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. In February, rioting in the Azerbaijani city of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> left dead 32 people _ 26 Armenians and six Azerbaijanis. On Tuesday, newspapers reported that a general strike began in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> following a large meeting Sunday on the city's main square. The meeting Sunday was with delegates who had attended last week's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Apparently dissatisfied with the Armenian delegation's presentation of the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> dispute, activists called a strike

 First lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> capped a busy birthday by attending `` Les Miserables'' at the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where the cast of the musical sang `` Happy Birthday'' and presented her with a cake. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, escorted by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, blew out the single candle on the large one-layer cake with white frosting as the first couple mingled with the cast during intermission. When an actress asked Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> whether `` this makes you want to get back into show business,'' the first lady replied: `` Yes. You'll save a place for us?'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> quipped that this `` is much different than `` Bedtime For Bonzo,'' one of the not-so-famous movies in which he played a leading role. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, 77, joked with the cast that when age sets in, three things happen: `` First, you start to forget things, uh, and I ca n't remember the other two. <PERSON> Claude-Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Schonberg </PERSON>, one of the adapters of the classic <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> novel about social injustice in 19th century <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, sent a telegram congratulating Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Noting he shared her birthday, he said, `` Great people are always born on the same day.'' Accompanying the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> to the theater were the president's daughter, <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and her husband, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Revell </PERSON>, along with former Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> Although there's no disputing the day, the date of Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s birthday is a sensitive subject around the White House Her official biography lists her birthdate as July 6, 1923, but her high school and college records record the year as 1921, making Wednesday her 67th birthday. Earlier Wednesday, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was treated to lunch at a country inn, <PERSON> L'Auberge </PERSON> <PERSON> Chez </PERSON> <PERSON> Francois </PERSON>, in suburban <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, where the staff presented her with a decorative ceramic teapot.

 The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> opened its season in mirthful fashion Wednesday with <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehar </PERSON>'s waltzing operetta `` The Merry Widow.'' Soprano <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> sang the title role with credit, from the poignant `` Vilia'' to her more rousing turns. Baritone <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> was splendid as Count <PERSON> Danilo </PERSON>, fond of the can-can girls at <ORGANIZATION> Maxim </ORGANIZATION>'s, fated to be landed as husband by the Merry Widow. White conveyed <PERSON> Danilo </PERSON>'s manly charm, whether his character was intending to charm or making a fool of himself with jealousy. His singing was robust without bluster and his only problem was some weak high notes. The second romantic couple in the plot were more noticed than usual because they sang so well. <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> was <PERSON> Natalie </PERSON>, wife of <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> <PERSON> Popoff </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> made his debut as <PERSON> Vicomte </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jolidon </PERSON>, her secret lover. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> does n't sing `` The Merry Widow Waltz,'' of course, but he has some of the evening's most romantic music. As he sang about the little pavilion into which he's taking <PERSON> Natalie </PERSON>, he sounded quietly romantic. Miss <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> joined in, in bittersweet tones. The audience lavished them with applause. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Billings </PERSON>, as the baron's flunky, Nisch, has the timing to make the oldest jokes funny again. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> McKee </PERSON> -LRB- Baron <PERSON> Popoff </PERSON> -RRB- had delivery nearly as good. The production was in English at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> State Theater. We did miss the kick line in Act 2 when seven men, five Marsovians and two Frenchmen, sing `` Girls, Girls, Girls.'' In the current staging, they march off. A song from another <PERSON> Lehar </PERSON> work, `` Girls Were Made To Love and Kiss,'' has been inserted and given to Count <PERSON> Danilo </PERSON>. It's in the brief third act and he is singing it _ with demonstrations _ to the can-can girls when the Merry Widow makes her entrance into Maxim's. <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pallo </PERSON> conducted. The season's second night, Thursday, moves firmly into opera territory, with `` La Boheme.''

 Opposition candidates accused the government of fraud in presidential elections Wednesday and met jointly with federal officials to protest. A journalist reported that an 8-year-old boy voted in one town. There appeared to be little doubt, however, that <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, would win a six-year term as president in an unbroken tradition dating to 1929. Official returns were not expected before Sunday. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>'s most visible opponent, <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> of the leftist coalition <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference the government `` is intending to have a fraud.'' `` We have begun to receive information nationwide that is not favorable for the government party,'' he said, before leaving for his meeting with <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibarra </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Piedra </PERSON> of the radical <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The three scheduled a news conference after their meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>. `` I want to tell you that all of these irregular acts, all of these repeated acts throughout the country, have created a situation of irregularity,'' <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> said. The party in power, known as the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>, has won every presidential election since its founding in 1929 and has controlled the congress and governorships in all 31 states. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Enriquez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>'s spokesman, said in an intervew that any incident of fraud `` has been less than one tenth of one percent of polling booths, and we're very pleased,'' `` This has been a peaceful election in which the vote has been respected,'' he said. This year, a clear deterioration of the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>'s influence was evidenced by the strong campaigns waged by <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON>. In addition to president, voters will elect 500 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> to three-year terms and 64 senators to six-year terms. All of the country's nearly 55,000 voting places closed by 6 p.m. -LRB- 8 p.m. EDT -RRB- except for those where people were still lined up to vote. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which supervises the balloting, said it received more than 50 complaints of voting irregularities, most of them minor, from political parties. Complaints ranged from missing ballots to a sailor who tried to vote repeatedly at different polls in the port of <LOCATION> Acapulco </LOCATION>. The most flagrant incidents of purported fraud were reported in <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>'s adopted home town of <LOCATION> Agualeguas </LOCATION>, about 80 miles north of <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> border. <PERSON> Petra </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, a reporter for the <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norte </ORGANIZATION>, said election officials `` let a lot of people vote for the whole family. They voted for their wife, their kids, their mom who could n't come.'' She said her paper had a picture of an 8-year-old boy who voted with his father's voting card. Although opposition parties by law are allowed to have representatives at each polling place, Ms. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said only <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> representatives were at the town's three precincts. `` The president of one precinct also was filling out ballots. I saw him get up nine times and put ballots in the boxes,'' she said. She said that when voters unfamiliar with the process would ask the president of the precinct how to vote, `` he said, ` Just take the ballots and mark where it says <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>.''' Presidents of precincts are appointed by the government and are always from <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> officials said they doubted the reports of fraud in <LOCATION> Agualeguas </LOCATION>. `` It was a very peaceful vote ... obviously with a preference for <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Enriquez </PERSON>. Almost all industry and commerce in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> closed for the day. Traffic on normally bustling city streets was light. The commission issued no immediate figures on turnout among the 38 million eligible voters. But long lines were reported at polling stations in major cities and towns. Outgoing President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> voted at a school across from the presidential residence in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. His term expires Dec. 1 and under the constitution he can not be re-elected. <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION> won 70 percent of the vote in 1982. The victory margin was not expected to be as wide for his likely successor, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>. <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON>'s conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cardenas </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> coalition </ORGANIZATION> have weakened the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>'s popular support <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ibarra </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Piedra </PERSON> signed an agreement last week to fight fraud and pledged to challenge the results if tampering was suspected. On Saturday, assassins with shotguns killed <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Ovando </PERSON>, a long-time <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> collaborator and strategist in his campaign, and an <PERSON> Ovando </PERSON> aid. Police said Tuesday the shootings were not politically motivated. They said <PERSON> Ovando </PERSON> was killed in revenge for fighting organized crime while serving as <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION> attorney general when <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> was governor of the state. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> called the slayings `` a provocation'' and said it showed how far `` some of the most reactionary sectors'' within the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> will go. He did not identify any group. The 54-year-old <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> ran on a platform of renewed nationalism and was aided by the affection Mexicans still feel for his father, the late President <PERSON> Lazaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, a 40-year-old Harvard-educated economist, was handicapped by having been de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s budget director and author of his economic austerity program. He has pledged to modernize the country's economic and political systems. <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON>, a wealthy 54-year-old rancher and businessman from northwestern <LOCATION> Sinaloa </LOCATION> state, said he would return even more state-owned companies to the private sector and ask farmers if they want the current system of cooperative farms or private property.

 A forest fire that consumed more than 4,000 acres of timber in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s Custer State Park burned to within 4 -LCB- miles of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rushmore </LOCATION> late Wednesday, forcing the evacuation of hundreds of people over 40 square miles. The evacuation, which involved 600 people earlier Wednesday, was broadened when the fire burned across the park's northern boundary Wednesday night and entered <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, site of the granite memorial to four presidents. Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mickelson </PERSON> said it was likely the fire would get worse. `` It makes you just sick to see the damage that's being done,'' he said after touring the area by helicopter. Afternoon winds hampered efforts to douse a 1,500-acre fire in the <ORGANIZATION> Bridger-Teton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, but crews in the <ORGANIZATION> Shoshone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> to the north were controlling the way a 1,650-acre fire was burning. Three other fires in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> covered about 1,900 acres of backcountry in Yellowstone National Park, while firefighters battled 850-acre blazes in both a <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> park and a <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> forest. The three other <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> fires, one of which covered 1,800 acres in the northwestern corner of the park, were set by lightning strikes. Park crews were allowing them to burn because the fires were not threatening any structures. Extremely dry conditions in <LOCATION> Custer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> were contributing to the spread of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> fire, which authorities believe was started by lightning Monday night. Firefighters had difficulty building a fire line because the blaze was burning in a very steep, rocky area, fire spokesman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagen </PERSON> said. Planes were dropping fire-retardant chemicals once an hour, but <PERSON> Hagen </PERSON> said the fire was nowhere near being contained. The fire earlier was estimated at 6,000 acres, but <PERSON> Hagen </PERSON> said thick smoke made that number faulty, and it was revised to 4,000 acres. About 125 people living around Mount Rushmore National Memorial were told to leave their homes late Wednesday night as a precaution, said <LOCATION> Custer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprague </PERSON>. Officials also advised residents of <ORGANIZATION> Keystone </ORGANIZATION>, about two miles from <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rushmore </LOCATION>, to go to a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> shelter in Rapid City or an armory in <LOCATION> Custer </LOCATION>. Although <ORGANIZATION> Keystone </ORGANIZATION> only has about 300 residents, officials said up to 2,000 people might be in the area because it's the height of the tourist season. <PERSON> Hagen </PERSON> said the 40-square-mile area area evacuated was mainly national forest land but added, `` It looks to me like there's some private land, some homes and some mining claims.'' One firefighter was hurt, but his injury was not believed serious, <PERSON> Hagen </PERSON> said. Smoke billowed thousands of feet into the air, with the plume visible in <LOCATION> Rapid </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, 25 miles away. A haze from the smoke hung over a large part of western <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and was visible from <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON>, 160 miles away. All entrances to the park were closed Wednesday and 600 people were evacuated. Authorities said no structures had burned, but buildings were not considered safe. The fire had been burning toward the northeast but switched to the northwest Wednesday and was 7-8 miles south of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rushmore </LOCATION> National Memorial. <PERSON> Mickelson </PERSON> declared an emergency, releasing state resources to fight the blaze, and planned to view the fire by helicopter, said his press secretary. In <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, gusting winds that spread the fire in the <LOCATION> Bridger-Teton </LOCATION> forest Tuesday built again Wednesday afternoon, threatening crews' hopes of containing the blaze by evening, said forest spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingwill </PERSON>. A volunteer firefighter was taken to the <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Burn Center with serious burns on his hands, arms and chest, <PERSON> Kingwill </PERSON> said. The fire, burning in sagebrush, juniper and aspen groves near the southern end of <LOCATION> Fremont </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, was sparked by Fourth of July revelers, the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. In the <ORGANIZATION> Shoshone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, fire commander `` Tut'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said, `` The fire now is responding to our management as opposed to us responding to the fire behavior.'' The blaze was touched off by lightning almost two weeks ago. In <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s Zion National Park, firefighters carved fire lines around half a blaze that blackened heavy oak and manzanita brush and Ponderosa pine, officials said. About 120 firefighters were battling the lightning-caused blaze, and another 80 were standing by, said Park Superintendent <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Grafe </PERSON>. The fire began June 19 and was allowed to burn in a small area until Sunday, when winds up to 60 mph spread the flames, said Chief Ranger <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>. Winds eased to 10 mph Wednesday and <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> said fire bosses predicted they would contain the blaze by Thursday evening. No injuries or property damage were reported. Another southern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> fire broke out and consumed about 3,000 acres by late Wednesday on <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> and private land about 3 miles north of <LOCATION> Beryl </LOCATION>, fire dispatcher <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said. The cause was undetermined. About 290 firefighters as well as air tankers battled a brush fire in <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Padres </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, authorities said. Temperatures were in the 90s, humidity was low and moderate winds of 5 mph to 15 mph fanned the blaze but no structures were threatened, said <PERSON> Juanita </PERSON> <PERSON> Freel </PERSON>, a forest spokeswoman. The cause of the blaze, which broke out Tuesday afternoon, was undetermined. In <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, state forestry officials responded to 26 fires on 567 acres Tuesday, spokesman <PERSON> Townley </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergmann </PERSON> said. At least three of the fires reported Tuesday remained burning Wednesday and 14 new fires were reported by Wednesday afternoon.

<HEAD>Nationalists Open Party Congress With Tough Talk On Communists,
Violence</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Teng-hui </PERSON> opened a key congress of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> today with a cautious promise of more democratic change and tough talk on rival Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The landmark meeting began at a suburban <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> sports stadium packed with more than 10,000 people. Behind the podium hung three huge portraits of the 94-year-old party's three previous leaders _ <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Yat-sen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON> and his son, <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching-kuo </PERSON>, who died in January. The congress, the party's 13th, is the first in which delegates were not handpicked by top party officials and in which a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> election was not restricted to candidates proposed by the party leader. It comes at a time of increasing political liberalization in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, a nation slowly emerging from its authoritarian past. The congress' 1,209 delegates are expected to elevate a new generation of party leaders to replace aging conservatives who came from the mainland with <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON> after the Communists forced the Nationalists from mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1949. An overhaul of the Cabinet also is expected after the congress, with speculation centering on the fate of 74-year-old Premier <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuo-hwa </PERSON>, who is viewed as the leading conservative. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, the acting party chairman since <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON>'s death, said in his speech that the Nationalists `` should accelerate the implementation of the reforms initiated by late Chairman <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching-kuo </PERSON> with an even more active and responsible attitude.'' But he cautioned that `` extremism and violence are the greatest enemies of democracy,'' an apparent reference to recent street demonstrations for accelerated political change. Those protests have occasionally turned violent. In his final years, <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching-kuo </PERSON> ended <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s 38-year-old martial law, tolerated the formation of opposition parties, opened the door to unofficial contact with rival Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and relaxed controls on the press. In cautiously pushing more reform, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s speech appeared tailored to placate both aging Nationalist conservatives, some of whom may step down during the congress, and younger party members who support more political, social and economic liberalization. <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang </PERSON>, a party delegate, described <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> as `` a man of tolerance'' with elements of a good party leader. Indeed, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> is expected to be named the party's permanent chairman on Friday. `` He accepts different opinions and absorbs them,'' said <PERSON> Chang </PERSON>, an illegitimate son of <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching-kuo </PERSON> who took his mother's surname <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> spent much of his 30-minute speech reiterating <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s hardline policy of no official contacts with the Chinese Communists Both the Nationalists, or Kuomintang, and Communists claim to be the rightful ruler of mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> accused <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> of having `` blind ambition to destroy'' the Nationalist government. `` We have no illusions about the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> regime and will make no compromise of any kind with them.'' The Nationalists have rejected <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s call for reunification under a `` one country, two systems'' policy in which <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> could retain its capitalist economy. Unofficial contact between the two sides has increased recently, particularly with <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching-kuo </PERSON>'s decision last year to end a ban on travel to the mainland to allow family reunions. Indirect trade also has increased and many businessmen are seeking permission to invest and trade directly with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 1 billion people. The future <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> policy of this nation of about 20 million people is expected to be a hot topic at the congress, with some delegates pushing for increased trade and exchanges.

 Swimming along a 25-mile stretch of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shore </LOCATION> was prohibited Wednesday after medical waste, including blood vials and syringes, washed ashore, officials said. State, county and town beaches were advised to forbid swimming until health inspectors determine that the waters are safe, said <PERSON> Shelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Domash </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Nassau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Beaches were closed from <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> in southwest <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> east to <LOCATION> Robert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moses </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in southwest <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, she said. The area includes the popular Jones Beach State Park. Officials were trying to determine the origin of the debris. <PERSON> Domash </PERSON> said it may have been illegally dumped by a hospital or laboratory. The discovery came just as a heat wave moved over the region, with forecasters predicting temperatures in the 90s through the weekend. Hundreds of thousands of people usually flock to the beaches on the weekends. Two syringes were spotted at <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> on Tuesday, <PERSON> Domash </PERSON> said. On Wednesday as the tide came in, a vial of blood, empty vials and a medical scrub brush were found at <LOCATION> Lido </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, then two more syringes at <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, she said. At <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, a glass container and surgical sutures washed up. Two truckloads of debris _ including a red waste bag, apparently carrying infectious hospital waste, filled and empty vials and syringes, bandages, grease balls, seaweed and firecrackers _ were removed from the beaches at <LOCATION> Lido </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Domash </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, the regional director of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parks </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Jones </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> were closed after a handful of debris, including plastic wrappers and what appeared to be parts of syringes, were found at the parks' beaches Wednesday `` It's the unknown _ you do n't know what it is or what it's carrying,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said `` We wanted to be on the safe side.''

<HEAD>Democrats Have Votes to Override Veto of Plant-Closing Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Holding enough votes this time to override a veto, Democrats are forcing a second election-year showdown with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> over giving workers advance notice of plant closings and large layoffs. On a 72-23 vote Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed a bill requiring companies to give 60 days' notice before shutting down any operation or instituting a layoff affecting more than 50 people or a third of the work force. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> cited the mandated notices as his primary reason for vetoing a massive overhaul of the nation's trade laws two months ago, saying advance notices would reduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> competitiveness and stifle new job creation. But with polls showing more than 80 percent voter support for the measure and Democrats using the issue to attack the economic policies of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 19 Republicans _ including seven up for re-election _ broke with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday's vote. Wednesday's vote was the biggest legislative victory for organized labor since it helped return the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to Democratic control in the 1986 election after Republicans held the majority the first six years of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidency. Just nine <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans supported the mandatory notices a year ago, when they were made a part of the trade bill. And only 10 broke ranks last month when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, on a 61-37 vote, fell five votes short of the necessary two-thirds for overriding <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto `` I'm certain that it's going to become law,'' lamented Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, a leading opponent of the notice bill. `` The tragedy is that we're doing this all because of politics.'' A White House official said after the vote that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has not stated definitely that he will veto it. The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the president's advisers were divided on the issue even though the administration put out a statement prior to the vote saying they would urge him to veto it. `` I do n't know what the president's going to do when he gets this bill,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., who complained earlier about labor leaders `` wielding a lot of clout in this body. Both supporters and opponents of the legislation raised the possibility that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> might allow the bill to become law after the expected <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approval without signing it. Under the Constitution, a president has only 10 working days to veto a bill after passage by both houses. `` I would hope that the president would see there are sufficient votes to override a veto and that will mean that he wo n't veto it,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, the bill's chief author. Had the measure been law the past two years, more than 800,000 workers who were laid off each year in 1986 and 1987 would have received advance notices, he said. A 1985 study by the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> showed that more than half the 2.2 million workers caught up in mass layoffs annually received one day's notice or less before losing their jobs. House Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., said the Senate-passed bill will be taken up in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> early next week, to be followed immediately by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> action on a revised trade bill that does n't include the plant-closing notices The House has never voted on the plant-closing issue itself. But its 308-113 vote in May to override <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of the trade bill is viewed as assuring veto-proof passage there as well. The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> made the layoff notices its top legislative priority the past two years and vowed to withdraw its pivotal support for any trade legislation desired by major business groups if the measure were not included or enacted separately. <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> called Wednesday's vote margin overwhelming and a `` welcome message for American workers.'' <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> opponents won a minor political skirmish along the way. They stalled the vote for two weeks, effectively denying Democrats a chance to override a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> veto before the Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. A year ago, the mandatory notices were opposed by four Democrats and 36 Republicans. The four Democrats _ <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> _ had all switched sides by the time of the vote last month on overriding <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto. So had five Republicans, three of them up for re-election this year _ <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. By Wednesday's vote, another seven Republicans switched sides _ <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Of that group, only <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> is up for election this year.

<HEAD>Decline In Dollar Helps Cut US Labor Costs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With the smallest wage increases of any industrial nation and help from a sinking dollar, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories outperformed their foreign rivals last year in reducing labor costs and making their goods more competitive on world markets. Measured in devalued American dollars, labor costs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> declined 1.5 percent in 1987, compared with increases of 7.5 percent in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, 7.7 percent in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, 13.5 percent in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and 23.9 percent in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. But even before the dramatic devaluation of the dollar against major European and <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> currencies, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> outperformed all but <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in keeping a lid on labor costs. Measured by their own currency, the yen, Japanese manufacturers reduced their labor costs by 2.5 percent. Excluding <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, labor costs rose for nine other major industrial powers. `` Clearly there's a definite improvement in out competitiveness vis-a-vis our trading partners,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> consulting house. `` But we still have a long way to go to restore the competitiveness we lost over the past decade.'' The government data showed that labor costs, measured in American dollars, rose an average 3.3 percent annually from 1979 through 1985 while falling 2.3 percent in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, 1.8 percent in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, 4.8 percent in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and 2.4 percent in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Wage increases in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> averaging 6.9 percent annually those years also outpaced the gains enjoyed by workers in all of the other countries when measured in dollars. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers, however, held hourly wage and benefit increases last year to just 1.3 percent, the lowest of any of the industrial powers, according to the government data. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was close with wage and benefit increases averaging 1.4 percent. But wages rose 4 percent in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and 4.5 percent in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> while soaring 8.2 percent in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. But with civilian unemployment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> now hovering in the range of 5 -LCB- percent, <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> noted that wage increases have been escalating rapidly the past two months. `` That suggests that our labor costs are rising at the same time that the dollar has quit falling,'' <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> said. `` This year we will not repeat the experience of last year.'' For one thing, he said, declines in the industrial sectors of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have all bottomed out and they are begining to enjoy the same rebound in manufacturing that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has experienced in the past year. The Labor Department figures, in fact, showed that manufacturing growth last year was slower in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> than in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> productivity improvements at 2.8 percent also were smaller than 4 percent gains of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, 7 percent increase in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and nearly 8 percent improvement in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. While five of the nine countries had larger 1987 productivity increases than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, only <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> exceeded the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rate of improvement over the past two years, the government said. However, only the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> experienced any employment growth in manufacturing last year. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> increase was only one-half of 1 percent, but it reversed two straight years of declines. Factory jobs remained about the same in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and fell by 1 percent to 2.5 percent in the other countries. For <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, 1987 was the 13th consecutive year of manufacturing employment declines and in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> factory jobs have been falling in number for the past 10 years.

<HEAD>DOE Advisory Board Backs Construction Of New Reactor in South
Carolina</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report favors building a new reactor in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> over converting a mothballed one in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state to ensure an adequate supply of raw materials for the nation's nuclear weapons. The department's existing production reactors are located at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> complex near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, but all of them presently are shut down. The report found that construction of a new heavy-water reactor at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> would result in a plant based on reliable technology and located in a setting with years of experience in producing and handling tritium, a key element in nuclear bombs. `` The heavy-water reactor appears to have the best chance of quickly providing the needed capacity because of existing facilities, personnel and experiences at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>,'' the report said. The report said that while conversion of the mothballed <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> nuclear plant at the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> reservation offered some `` unique opportunities,'' both legal and technical uncertainties presented serious drawbacks. Although the report conceded that conversion of the WPPSS plant may not take as long to complete or cost as much, at least initially, as other options, it cited other problems. `` There are risks because of the need to demonstrate an adequate target technology, uncertainties of public acceptance of conversion to defense purposes, and possible delays because of the legal process required to acquire the WPPSS facility,'' the report said. The commercial reactor was more than 60 percent complete when mothballed in 1982 as <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>, the construction arm of public utilities in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, ran into financial difficulties and questions were raised about whether the electricity the plant would produce would be needed. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> report was released by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, a leading opponent of converting the WPPSS plant, and other <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> congressional offices. `` I've said all along that conversion is the wrong option and should not be pursued,'' said <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. `` This report reaches the same conclusion.'' One of the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> production reactors is undergoing extensive work to fortify it against earthquakes. Another has been closed for the summer because its discharge is too warm to comply with state water quality regulations and the third is undergoing routine maintenance.

 Soviet exchange students spending the summer at picturesque <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> made their first official excursion off campus _ to a dump, a metal recycling operation and a trash incinerator. Not exactly the kind of trip you would write home about, unless you were majoring in environmental studies, which they are. So the garbage bags, piles of tires, crushed cars and discarded wood were just want they wanted to see. `` Welcome to the city of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> landfill,'' dump superintendent <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Besaw </PERSON> said Wednesday as the students gathered close to hear how his operation works. Some took notes, others took photos of news photographers taking photos of them and one consulted a Russian-American dictionary before asking a question about the trash. The 16 Soviet students have been in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> since late June, part of an exchange in which 16 Americans, mostly from <LOCATION> Dartmouth </LOCATION>, spent about six weeks at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The students major in areas including chemistry, molecular biology and biophysics. Most have completed four years of their five-year college studies and will likely be scientists, teachers and researchers in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which is trying to deal with the same environmental problems plaguing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ water and air pollution, acid rain, hazardous waste and trash disposal. The outing to the dump and Signal Environmental Systems' refuse-to-energy plant in <LOCATION> Claremont </LOCATION> was the first time the students met reporters, which meant interviews atop clay-covered mounds of trash, next to cans of discarded copper tubing or next to a garbage truck being weighed before dumping its load at the incinerator They drove from the hot, dusty dump to an adjacent hotter and dustier metal recycling area, where a shirtless <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Janci </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Janci </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metal </ORGANIZATION> and Recycling explained his business. <PERSON> Dimitrij </PERSON> <PERSON> Kavtaradze </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> State professor teaching at <LOCATION> Dartmouth </LOCATION> this year, picked up a horseshoe _ `` This is the best souvenir from <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, good luck!'' _ and asked <PERSON> Janci </PERSON> if he could keep it. <PERSON> Janci </PERSON> said yes. After seeing how trash is buried or prepared for re-use, it was off to the incinerator to learn about another way to dispose of refuse, burning _ again taking pictures and notes. Professor <PERSON> Burdin </PERSON> <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON>, also from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> State, said the main purpose of the visit is to learn how the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> deals with environmental problems. `` The main thing is to see what kinds of problems are in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and how do you solve these problems,'' <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he said, `` is on the frontier'' of dealing with environmental problems. The American experience, he said, should help Soviets struggling with the same problems, especially with questions of balancing growth with the environment and even with citizen opposition to construction projects such as a sewer proposal that prompted protest near <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. And the exchange experience may help his students understand more about <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` We should understand people. We should understand problems. We can not separate problems and people,'' he said. `` In some ways it's people diplomacy. Some of the students talked about their first impressions of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, saying they were impressed with the highways and friendly people. `` They are very friendly people,'' said <PERSON> Olga </PERSON> <PERSON> Divovich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` They often smile at us and it's very pleasant for us.''

<HEAD>President Roh Offers Plan To Ease Tensions With North</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo today announced a six-point plan to ease 40 years of bitter confrontation with communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and clear the way for peaceful reunification of the divided peninsula. In a nationally televised speech, the president called for broad trade, humanitarian, cultural and political contacts with the north to normalize relations and end the struggle for supremacy. `` I believe we have now come to a historic moment when we should be able to find a breakthrough toward a lasting peace and unification on the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula,'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said. He called for an end to international rivalry between the two <LOCATION> Koreas </LOCATION> in foreign diplomacy, saying the two nations should work together instead of competing for international backing and trying to isolate each other. `` We hope to bring an end to counterproductive diplomacy characterized by competition and confrontation between the south and the north ... We also hope that representatives of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> will contact each other freely in international forums,'' he said. The six points, most of which had already been mentioned by <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> in recent weeks, were similar or identical to proposals made by other <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> governments since 1972. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s proposals did not go as far as a call by President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> for a meeting with North Korean President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> in 1981 that never took place. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said more measures would be taken if <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> `` will positively respond to the measures outlined.'' In a separate development, the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> warned today that the north `` is inevitably expected to provoke war if the opportunity arises'' and had not given up its plans to conquer the south. A group of newspaper editors were told at a ministry briefing that the north continues to mass its forces on the border for a possible lightning strike. The ministry routinely makes such warnings, but it was not clear why the briefing was held the same day as <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s speech. South and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have no relations and technically remain at war since no peace treaty was signed at the end of the Korean War in 1953. The border is closed, there are no communications or transport links and both governments refuse to recognize each other. The pro-Western capitalist south is emerging as a major economic power, while the communist north is one of the world's most repressive and isolated nations. There was no immediate response from the north, but unification is not seen as possible under existing conditions with both Koreas refusing to abandon their rival political systems. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s main opposition parties, which have been pressing the government to move ahead on unification, cautiously welcomed <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s proposal as a `` forward looking step.'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said the south would no longer try to stop nations it has ties with from trading with the north `` provided that it does not involve military goods.'' He also said <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> would help the north establish relations with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s allies, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> would continue to seek relations with the north's allies, principally the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, he said. South and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have been bitter opponents since their creations in 1948 after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet troops divided the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula at the end of World War II. The communist north invaded the south in 1950 to start the Korean War. Unification has become a major issue in the south in recent months with radical and dissident groups pushing for quick action to reunite the peninsula. The <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government, caught off guard on the issue, has been trying to recapture the political iniative. Past attempts at improving relations between the two countries resulted in a few exchange and cultural visits and talks on a variety of issues. But the talks always collapsed before making substantial progress. The last talks between the two Koreas collapsed in 1986 after the north protested joint South Korean-U.S. military exercises. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has about 42,000 troops in the south under a mutual defense treaty.

<TEXT>
 A lawsuit accusing a top defense contractor of charging the government for everything from building a private plane to typing the Bible into a computer could open the way for fraud investigations into top-secret projects, a watchdog group says. `` What we have is a little wedge into the ` black' world,'' projects so secret they often do n't appear on the defense budget, said <PERSON> Dina </PERSON> <PERSON> Rasor </PERSON>, head of the Washington-based Project on Military Procurement. `` -LRB- It shows -RRB- you can expose fraud and waste in a black program'' without divulging sensitive information, she said. <PERSON> Rasor </PERSON> spoke at a news conference Wednesday to unseal the lawsuit alleging fraud and overcharging against <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missiles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the leading defense contractor in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s high-tech <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. The lawsuit, filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> by a former and a current employee, claims <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> workers, while waiting months for security clearances, goofed off, ran profitable businesses, ran a football pool and even built a private plane _ all at government expense. If proved, the charges could result in suspension of defense contracts. The alleged violations at one <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> plant cost the government more than $ 10 million, but that figure could go higher, the plaintiffs' attorney said. `` We expect additional people are going to step forward and describe additional examples of fraud at <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Saperstein </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>, the plaintiffs also charged, told employees to bill various government contracts for 40 hours even if they worked less and to charge their time to contracts on which they had not worked. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> denied the accusations. `` We very vigorously deny that false claims have been or are made or condoned by the company,'' said company spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulhern </PERSON>. `` In fact, we've had a very strong program over the past several years to make sure all employees know any form of mischarging is wrong and can lead to disciplinary action, including dismissal, if warranted.'' <PERSON> Mulhern </PERSON> said the company would wait until it receives a copy of the suit before responding to specific allegations. `` -LRB- But -RRB- we are also very confident the suit, if it goes to trial, will show the company has not engaged in any improper practices,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missiles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Space, with 23,700 employees in <LOCATION> Sunnyvale </LOCATION>, develops spacecraft, satellite systems and submarine-launched missiles. It is a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The suit was filed under a federal whistle-blower law by <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Newsham </PERSON>, 45, a former <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> analyst, and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Overbeek </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloem </PERSON>, 34, an engineer who works for the company. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also is a plaintiff. The law protects whistle-blowers from retaliation and allows them to keep some of the judgments against companies convicted of cheating the government. The complaint, which seeks damages and a jury trial, is one of the first false claims suits involving a classified `` black'' project for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, a surveillance branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Newsham </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bloem </PERSON>, who both held security clearances from the <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION>, worked at <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> on the project from 1981 to 1984. They allege that `` a huge amount'' of time was wasted at <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> in the `` ice box,'' a period ranging from a year to 18 months during which employees could not work on sensitive projects until they received security clearance. `` Rather than being given non-classified work, their time was wasted,'' <PERSON> Saperstein </PERSON> said. `` When the end of the week rolled around, they billed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government for 40 hours for no work, essentially.'' Employees allegedly found ways to keep busy, including selling real estate, honey and belt buckles or working on their cars or playing computer games. One senior manager, the suit says, had <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> machinists build him an airplane and was allowed to retire and take the plane with him when the project was discovered. `` One <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> employee wrote out the entire Bible onto a <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> computer, charging government contracts for his time,'' the suit says. <PERSON> Newsham </PERSON> was fired in 1984. She said the company refused to give a reason. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contract </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> substantiated the allegations after <PERSON> Newsham </PERSON> called a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` hot line'' in 1984, <PERSON> Saperstein </PERSON> said. Reports from the agency, which has no enforcement power, were filed with the suit.

The Chicago-based bank, then the seventh largest in the nation, in 1984 ceived $ 4.5 billion _ $ 3.5 billion of it borrowed from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> _ in an unprecendented move by the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>. As part of the rescue, the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> took over many of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>' problem loans and acquired ownership of the bank's stock. It expects to recoup all but $ 1.7 billion of the bailout money by selling the loans and the stock. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> insures accounts in commercial banks up to $ 100,000.

 Black-clad mourners shook fists in anger as they marched behind Iranian flag-draped coffins, vowing to avenge the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s downing of an <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> passenger jet with 290 people aboard. The mourners waved banners and shouted `` Revenge, Revenge'' and `` Down with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'' as 24 of the victims were buried on Wednesday. A team of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military experts, meanwhile, arrived in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> and began their inquiry into the attack by questioning senior officers of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> cruiser that fired the fatal missiles, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources said. In <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the manager of the airport where the <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> A300 originated was quoted as saying the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> failed to use the proper frequency when it issued a warning before firing two missiles at the plane. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said 200 bodies had been recovered from the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> since the USS Vincennes destroyed the plane Sunday. All but 38 of those aboard were Iranians. Fourteen were buried Wednesday in <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> and ten others were buried at <LOCATION> Zahedan </LOCATION>, in southeastern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, Iranian television reported. The television broadcast 15 minutes of scenes from the funerals. In <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, women clad in black chadors marched behind coffins and carried banners, some of which read: `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>: You fight with weapons and we with our belief in God, and your defeat is imminent.'' Men waved their fists, shouting `` Death to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>!'' Coffins were draped with the green, white and red Iranian flag. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> intentionally shot down the <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> over the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, gateway to the gulf. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> fired because the vessel's combat information center identified the approaching aircraft as an F-14 fighter on an attack bearing The aircraft, on a scheduled flight to <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> from <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, was shot down while the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ship was engaged in battle with Iranian gunboats, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. A six-member military investigating team arrived from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> late Tuesday and began probing the tragedy. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military sources said the team planned to interview Capt. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, skipper of the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, and other officers present during the crisis. The <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> airport manager, <PERSON> Hossein </PERSON> <PERSON> Peroussi </PERSON>, was quoted in today's <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> as saying he was in the control tower when the plane left for <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> on Sunday. `` The situation was quite normal. The airplane was right on course.'' he was quoted as saying. The Iranian government let more than 100 foreign correspondents into <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> Wednesday to interview airport personnel and view bodies of victims. <PERSON> Peroussi </PERSON> was quoted as denying <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> claims the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> sent warnings to the plane on both ultra-high frequency and very-high frequency radio channels. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> uses only UHF channels to warn approaching aircraft. `` That is useless for the <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION>, because he is on VHF,'' he said. `` We heard the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> every day; they did not announce a warning on VHF.'' <PERSON> Peroussi </PERSON> said transponders on the plane emitted signals `` only in a civilian mode, not a military mode.''' The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> received both types of signals from the plane. A plane carrying the remains of 71 of the victims had to abort its takeoff on Wednesday when some of the coffins toppled over inside the plane, the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> reported. It said about 12 Western reporters were aboard. The pilot of the C-130 braked to a halt just before takeoff, the newspaper said. The plane was en route to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, it said. Iranian officials showed the bodies of the victims to reporters, including cutting open one body bag and displaying a woman holding a baby in her arms, the paper said.

 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> destroyer aimed its weapons at a helicopter chartered by a television news crew after two warnings to keep clear apparently were lost in the din of <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> radio traffic. The incident occurred Wednesday, three days after the American cruiser <ORGANIZATION> Vincennes </ORGANIZATION> shot down an <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> Air Airbus A300, killing all 290 people aboard. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, which had just finished a skirmish with Iranian gunboats, mistook the jetliner for an Iranian F-14 fighter. On Wednesday, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> destroyer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> had a routine radio exchange with an Iranian jet fighter but did not contanct an <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> passenger jet flying a few miles away. An <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> spokesman confirmed the arrival in <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> of Flight 657 on a scheduled flight late Wednesday morning from <LOCATION> Shiraz </LOCATION>, and said it returned to the central Iranian city after refueling and taking on passengers. It flew within several miles of the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON>, which was off the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> and in radio contact with many commercial aircraft in the <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> air corridor. Monitoring of radio traffic showed <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> air controllers in constant touch with an <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> jet as it approached for landing, but the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> made no attempt to establish contact. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> crewmen were, however, wary of some other aircraft, including an Iranian warplane whose type was unclear in the noisy radio chatter. The <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> asked politely for its name and intention, and the Iranian pilot responded in English that he was `` making routine daily check flight.'' A tense moment came when the destroyer challenged a helicopter approaching from the direction of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> through the haze of a sandstorm that reduced visibility to a few miles. Its request for identification went unanswered and the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> assumed a heightened state of readiness, ordering other aircraft in the area away and locking its weapons on the helicopter, which approached to within five miles. Radio contact finally was established with the chopper, which was chartered by an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> news </ORGANIZATION> team. An officer of the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> was heard saying: `` Be advised, sir, we did pass two warnings to you. The direction of your approach and the flight profile you exhibited did cause us to lock you up with weapons. Request you guard this frequency more closely in future.'' The pilot, who has flown the gulf for more than a year, replied: `` I am on this frequency from the time I leave <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> and never take it off. I am afraid your transmissions were n't heard.''

<HEAD>Shiite Group Threatens U.S. Hostages Over Iran Jet Downing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A shadowy Shiite Moslem group implied today that it will use two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hostages it holds to avenge a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship's downing of an Iranian airliner. In a typewritten statement in Arabic, the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> said the hostages will `` be part of a comprehensive response that will make the killers and their partners pay the price.'' The statement said `` everybody knows that all the strong cards are still in our hands, including the hostages' issue.'' On Sunday, the <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vincennes </ORGANIZATION> shot down an <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> jet over the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said all 290 aboard were killed and vowed to avenge the deaths. The Pentagon said the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>' crew mistook the Airbus A300 for an F-14 jet fighter. Today's statement was delivered to the offices of a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> news agency in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> accompanied by a photocopy of one of the pages of American hostage <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>'s passport, apparently to prove its authenticity. The photocopy was of a page that includes <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>'s photograph. The group, which apparently comprises pro-Iranian extremists, has claimed the abduction of <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, 58, a writer of children's books, and another <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>, 57, acting controller at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> Both were abducted in the fall of 1986. <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, are among nine Americans and nine other foreigners held hostage by various groups in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

The relationship between the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is unclear. The organization has threatened <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> before.

<TEXT>
 Southern farmers sent more than 1,500 bales of hay to the drought-stricken <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, saying they had n't forgotten their `` Yankee friends,'' while marijuana growers in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> dug water pits to keep their million-dollar weeds wet. Farmers of legal crops in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> hoped to receive 1,000 bales of hay today, courtesy of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> farmers returning a favor paid to them two years ago. And for the first time in weeks, barges were not stalled on the drought-shoaled <LOCATION> Mississppi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. `` We're glad to show our <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> friends we have n't forgotten them,'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s commissioner of agriculture, said Wednesday after he threw a bale of hay onto a tractor-trailer. `` This is a good will effort on our part to reciprocate for what they did for us two years ago,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said. `` We're paying them back.'' <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> was one of several Midwestern states that came to the aid of Southern farmers during the drought of 1986. This year, the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> has been suffering from what has been called the worst drought in 50 years. Also on Wednesday, a livestock truck loaded with about 450 bales of hay donated by <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, farmers departed for <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> from the <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livestock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, six <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> rail cars filled with 172 tons of donated hay left for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. Organizer <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said the hay should arrive July 13, and that more was being shipped from <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Wednesday was another scorcher for the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, where dozens of record high temperatures were set, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. International Falls, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, sometimes called the nation's icebox, tied its all-time record high with 98 degrees. <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, reached 101 degrees, the second time this year the all-time record _ set on the Aug. 24, 1947 _ was tied. In the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> area, thousands of people bought bottled drinking water because the drought has allowed salt water to push up the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> from the gulf. `` I have a dog that refuses to drink it. It's salty, very salty,'' <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellard </PERSON> said of water drawn at Port Sulphur, about midway between the mouth of the river and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. On the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, the drought has lowered water levels, forcing barge traffic into the man-made 243-mile-long Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway, which ends at Mobile. In <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, barges and tows were moving through the channel near the confluence of the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> rivers. On the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> team surveyed the shallow channel in <LOCATION> Ballard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> on Wednesday to determine whether it should be closed again for dredging, said Petty Officer 3rd Class <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. `` It may be necessary to close the channel for one or two days later this week,'' <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> said., there was no backlog of tow boats and barges waiting to pass through the channel near the confluence of the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> rivers, <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> said. It marked the first time since the channel reopened Sunday that the boats did not have to wait in line. Meanwhile, the drought was showing no favoritism among <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> crops _ wilting corn and soybeans as well as young Christmas trees and marijuana plants. The drought killed all 2,500 Christmas tree seedlings in <LOCATION> Clinton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafin </PERSON> planted this year at his farm in southwest <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. In nearby <LOCATION> Ross </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, Sheriff <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamman </PERSON> said marijuana needs as much water as other crops, and growers `` are going to have to water it by hand,'' or create an irrigation system. `` The people that grow the million-dollar crop will take a lot more care of their plants,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> attorney general's office. Some growers have dug water pits, usually lined with plastic, and haul water from the pits to the illegal plants, he said. Authorities are n't offering any relief to the pot growers, however. Officers began their marijuana eradication program earlier than usual this year because of the drought.

 Prices fell on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> today and the dollar slipped. Dealers attributed the yen's rise to fears that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit may grow and Japanese official statements against letting the dollar appreciate further. The dollar closed at 132.40 yen, down 1.13 yen from Wednesday's close Its high for the day was 132.98 yen and its low was 131.65. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 225 </ORGANIZATION> selected issues lost 38.47 points or 0.13 percent to move to 27,728.13. It had gained 189.43 points Wednesday on near-record trading volume of 2.8 billion. Today's volume was 2 billion shares. A broker for Vickers da Costa, who spoke on condition he not be identified, said concerns about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures to be released next week put pressure on the dollar. He also said there was more confidence in the market after Japanese officials said they would n't let the dollar appreciate much more. `` If the dollar gets much stronger, you could well see intervention,'' he said. An exchange dealer at the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> said the market's mood was bearish toward the dollar amid relatively quiet trading. `` The exchange rates are moving toward adjustment,'' said the dealer, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The dollar hit 134.85 yen Monday, its highest closing rate since Nov. 24. It had risen rapidly by nearly 10 yen in the previous three weeks.

 Baby, the eight-foot Burmese python missing for three months, has been found, much to the shock of a new tenant in the apartment that <PERSON> Baby </PERSON>'s owner had vacated. `` I guess -LRB- she -RRB- opened up the drawer to do something and thereal control officer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranes </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Ranes </PERSON> answered the call and was greeted by two shaken women. <PERSON> Baby </PERSON> was a bit more calm. `` It just looked at me,'' <PERSON> Ranes </PERSON> said. `` It did n't do anything.'' It took police several hours to track down <PERSON> Baby </PERSON>'s owner, <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>. It all began in April, shortly after <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>'s boyfriend gave her the python as an Easter gift. The snake was given the run of the apartment while <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> arranged to have a 100-gallon custom tank built for the snake. But Baby vanished. Animal experts scoured the apartment, but they found no trace of the 60-pound snake. They guessed that <PERSON> Baby </PERSON> had slithered down the toilet or found her way under some cupboards and into the walls. For days, police answered calls from mothers who were afraid to let their children outside. Officer <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Forsyth </PERSON> said the mothers had little to fear because anything larger than a poodle is probably not on a python's menu. After a while, <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> gave up <PERSON> Baby </PERSON> for lost and moved out of the complex in early May. Police said Wednesday the python had not eaten in four or five months. <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> finally retrieved her pet, but the reunion was subdued. <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> remarked that <PERSON> Baby </PERSON> was thin and told reporters that she might try to sell her to a breeder.

 Officials from the towns of <LOCATION> Ashford </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Willington </PERSON> could n't see the boundary markers for the trees, but are still hoping to `` walk the line'' to settle a longstanding border dispute once fall arrives.

The officials did locate one of the key markers during their abbreviated walk Wednesday night. They expect to continue the exercise in September or October, said <PERSON> Willington </PERSON> First Selectman <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Csiki </PERSON>. `` It's a country problem, we're country people and we'll most likely resolve it in a country fashion,'' he said.

 The governing party claimed today that its candidate won <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s presidency, despite a computer breakdown at election headquarters and opposition charges that the government rigged the vote. Neither the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> nor any of the parties had released any results when <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> <PERSON> Dominguez </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, announced `` a crushing, legal and incontestable victory'' for <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> de Gortari shortly after 1:30 a.m. The party has ruled <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> since 1929. Moments after the victory claim, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> went on national television to reject allegations of vote fraud. A few hours earlier, the three leading opposition presidential candidates met with federal officials and issued a statement accusing the government of rigging the election. One witness to the voting Wednesday said she saw an 8-year-old boy cast a ballot. People were also seen voting for their whole families and election workers were said to be stuffing ballot boxes. `` The election day that just ended represented a civic awakening of the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> people'' that the government has quashed by rigging the vote, the opposition candidates said. The statement accuses the government of stuffing ballot boxes, eliminating citizens from voting rolls, paying people to vote and multiple voting. It says the irregularities `` seriously affect the cleanliness of today's balloting'' and `` could annul the results unless the problems are satisfactorily resolved.'' <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibarra </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Piedra </PERSON> of the radical <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> read the statement, as fellow candidates <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> stood by. Most polls closed at 6 p.m. -LRB- 8 p.m. EDT -RRB- Wednesday and the election commission had said partial returns would be available four hours later. By early today, however, no results or turnout had been released and officials said computer trouble was to blame. The election Wednesday was not only for president. Voters also elected a new 500-member Chamber of Deputies and a 64-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Opposition parties were expected to gain in the congress, which over the last few years has begun to shed its image of being a rubberstamp to the executive. Since its founding 1929, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s governing party, known as the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>, has won every presidential election and has controlled the national congress and the governorships of all 31 states. But this year, a clear deterioration of the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>'s influence was evidenced by the strong campaigns waged by <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON>. In 1982, President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON> won 70 percent of the vote. This year, the victory margin was not expected to be as wide for <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>. De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s six-year term expires Dec. 1 and under the constitution he can not be re-elected. Fraud was reportedly widespread in <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>'s adopted home town of <LOCATION> Agualeguas </LOCATION>, about 80 miles north of <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> border. <PERSON> Petra </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, a report an 8-year-old boy who voted with his father's voting card. She said election officials `` let a lot of people vote for the whole family. They voted for their wife, their kids, their mom who could n't come.'' `` The president of one precinct also was filling out ballots. I saw him get up nine times and put ballots in the boxes,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> officials denied the reports of fraud in <LOCATION> Agualeguas </LOCATION>. The campaign has not been without bloodshed. Gunmen on Saturday killed <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Ovando </PERSON>, a long-time <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> collaborator and strategistion but to <PERSON> Ovando </PERSON>'s tenure as <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION> attorney general. During that time, <PERSON> Ovando </PERSON> fought organized crime. But <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> called the slayings `` a provocation.'' In recent months, <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON>'s conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>' left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> coalition </ORGANIZATION> have weakened the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>'s popular support. For the first time, nearly the entire left unified behind one candidate, the 54-year-old <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>. Late in the campaign, <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Heberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> left the race and threw <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> his support. Only Mrs. <PERSON> Piedra </PERSON>'s party declined to join. <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON>, a wealthy 54-year-old rancher and businessman, ran on a free-enteed support among a middle class whose aspirations have been dashed by the country's 6-year economic crisis.

 Because an important witness failed to appear, a court today adjourned until next week the trial of a Lebanese man charged with the 1985 <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacking and murder of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver. Less than an hour after the trial of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> resumed today, chief judge <PERSON> Heiner </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueckenberger </PERSON> recessed the proceedings until Wednesday. The trial, under heavy security in a specially constructed prison courtroom, began Tuesday. Both of the trial's first two sessions have been cut short, raising prospects the proceedings could extend into next year. Already, officials have scheduled court days into December and say more could be added. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is on trial for murder and air piracy in the June 1985 <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacking. During the ordeal, 39 Americans were held hostage 17 days and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Waldorf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, was murdered after gunmen forced the <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> flight to land in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mueckenberger </PERSON> said he was adjourning the trial because a witness who knew <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> during his previous stay in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was unable to come to today's session. The man, a social worker, originally had been scheduled to testify next Wednesday but was later asked by the court to appear today. Tuesday's opening session was also quickly suspended after <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> refused to participate in the proceedings. Before adjourning today, the court heard a document from a court in the southern West German state of <LOCATION> Saarland </LOCATION>, which convicted <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> of theft and causing bodily injury and gave him a suspended nine-month sentence in 1983. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> lived in <LOCATION> Saarland </LOCATION> from 1982 to 1984. The document listed <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s date of birth as June 13, 1964. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> also has claimed he was born in 1966. The issue of age is important because it will determine the length of any sentence <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> receives if convicted. The range is from 15 years to life. Before hearing evidence on the chrgaes, the court must first determine whether <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> should be tried as a juvenile, young adult or adult. Under West German law, a juvenile is under 18, an adult is 21 and older, and a young adult is between 18 and 21. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> tried unsuccessfully to have <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> extradited to stand trial on its soil. Tuesday's hearing was recessed three times because of various legal disputes and <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s objection to the choice of an entepreter. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, in his only statements to the court, gave his name and asked for a new interpreter and replacement of one of his defense lawyers. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> said the interpreter was not qualified in his Arabic dialect. The murdered diver's parents, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> and Pir son's brutal murder was read. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was arrested at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport on Jan. 13, 1987, after he was found to be carrying liquid explosives. A <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> court sentenced his older brother, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, to 13 years in prison last April for kidnapping two West Germans in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in an attempt to gain freedom for his brother. One was later released, but the second is still being held in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> by a radical Shiite group.

<TEXT>
 Disasters have been a fixture in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> since its oil boom began in the 1960s, and oilmen regard the shallow, storm-swept waters as among the world's most hazardous petroleum fields. Explosions, structural defects on rigs and bad weather all have contributed to the regular tragedies that plague the region. The worst <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil field disaster was in 1980, when 137 crewmen on the accommodation platform <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kielland </PERSON> died as it capsized in storms in the Norwegian Ekofisk area. Most of the dead were Norwegians. Five years earlier, a ruptured pipeline on the same rig caused an explosion that killed three men. The first <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> spill was in April 1977, when at least 5.8 million gallons of oil escaped into the sea from the oil rig <LOCATION> Bravo </LOCATION> in the Ekofisk field run by <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilman <PERSON> Red </PERSON> <PERSON> Adair </PERSON> was brought in to cap the fracture. It took him and his team five attempts to cap the rig, but not before a slick covered 1,500 square miles. In November 1965, three people died and 11 others were injured when an explosion ripped the bottom out of a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil drilling barge at <LOCATION> Teesport </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Middlesbrough </LOCATION> in northeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. In December 1965, 13 men died when the Sea Gem rig collapsed and sank. In November 1981, the <ORGANIZATION> Transworld </ORGANIZATION> 58 platform was torn from its moorings and drifted for several hours in hurricane winds. Forty-four men were evacuated but another 20 remained trapped aboard the platform for several hours before being rescued. There were no casualties. In 1982, one man was killed on the same <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> platform involved in Wednesday's disaster when a walkway collapsed. In 1984, a fire on the production platform Brent Bravo killed three workers when they were trapped in a shaft. In 1985, two maintenance workers died in an explosion in the semi-submersible rig Glomar Arctic II. Last March, a total of 40 workers were winched by helicopter from two rigs that got into trouble in gales. The same night, another rig drifted off the Norwegian coast with 77 men aboard. Last Friday, an explosion occurred at British Petroleum's Sullom Voe <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil terminal on the <LOCATION> Shetland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, but no injuries were reported. On Tuesday, fire broke out on the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> Brent Alpha platform. Again, no injuries were reported. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> said a total of 123 fixed installations, including the <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> platform involved in Wednesday night's disaster, are currently in the British sector of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil field. The department said there are additionally about 40 semi-submersible rigs and jack-up rigs in the British sector. Semi-submersible rigs float and can travel under their own power, while four-legged jack-up rigs stand on the sea bottom and are generally used for exploration in shallower waters.

The converted oil-rig supply ship Encounter Bay was towed into <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter <PERSON> Boutwell </PERSON> and placed under tight security Wednesday. The street value of the cargo was estimated by the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> at $ 280 million. The Encounter Bay seemed to be heading for the Strait of <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuca </PERSON>, the entry to Puget Sound and the main channel to <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Allison </PERSON>, captain of the <PERSON> Boutwell </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Boutwell </PERSON>'s crew could read the word <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in obscured letters, and a few hours later, those aboard the 378-foot cutter had permission from the Panamanian embassy to board the Encounter Bay, <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> said. The Encounter Bay's crew yielded to a boarding party only after the <PERSON> Boutwell </PERSON> fired machine guns at its rudder and engine room and threatened to use cannon fire, <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> said. `` In my opinion,'' he said, the Encounter Bay captain `` was just trying to prolong the engagement so he could destroy all the records he could. `` It was a very organized operation, from the packaging all the way through to the control of the ship and the cleaning out of the boat's records.'' <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> said they found no records indicating the origin or destination of the vessel or who was in charge of the operation. The 180-foot Encounter Bay was not flying a flag when it was spotted late last week about 600 miles offshore. The owner of the Encounter Bay was listed as <ORGANIZATION> Countess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and the 18-member crew included three Americans, one from <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, one from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and 13 from <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. Sixteen appeared Wednesday before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON> and were advised of their rights and possible charges against them, and two others were to appear for the same purpose today when a <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> interpreter would be available. All are held in custody pending a detention hearing on Monday, when bail, if any, will be set, said deputy clerk <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamborn </PERSON>. The magistrate at that time would try to determine whether there was probable cause to send the case to a grand jury, she said. If it can be proved the ship was headed for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, crew members could prison terms of a few years to life, said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Liming </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> special agent-in-charge. The Encounter Bay's crew was cooperative but not talkative, <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> said. He estimated there was 72 tons of high-grade marijuana on board in about 8,000 `` bales'' packed into four large shipping containers. Each `` bale,'' in a blue nylon sack, contained eight packets of marijuana vacuum-sealed in double plastic wrappings.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls, Gold Rises In Europe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar fell against major currencies in moderate trading in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> today. Gold prices were higher. Foreign exchange dealers said hectic dealings in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> had calmed down before European markets opened and had not affected dollar exchange levels. Investors in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> were switching to Japanese yen in a flurry of buying, dealers said. With the dollar trading in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> at 1.80 West German marks to 1.83 West German marks, dealers said they did not expect much to happen as the American currency was comfortable at that level. But they said if the dollar moved higher than that, the central banks were likely to intervene and sell dollars to bring exchange rates back down. Italian markets reported currency dealing was very active with many large commercial orders. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar fell to a closing 132.40 Japanese yen from 133.53 yen at Wednesday's close. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> later, the dollar was trading lower at 131.75 yen. Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Wednesday: _ 1.8162 West German marks, down from 1.8217 _ 1.5090 Sw5135 _ 6.1135 French francs, down from 6.1315 _ 2.0481 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0515 _ 1,347.00 Italian lire, down from 1,351.75 _ 1.2050 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2168 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound cost $ 1.7190, more expensive for buyers than Wednesday's late $ 1.7130. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at $ 438.75 an ounce, up from $ 436.75 bid late Wednesday. At mid-morning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 439.15. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> bullion dealers described trading as moribund, blaming uncertainty about inflation and the unlikelihood of much change in dollar exchange rates. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold opened at $ 438.50 bid, up from Wednesday's late $ 437.50. At noon the price had moved higher to $ 438.90 bid. Earlier in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold closed higher at $ 441.62 bid, up from $ 441.05 late Wednesday. Silver bullion rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a bid $ 6.94 a troy ounce, up from $ 6.77 late Wednesday.

<TEXT>
 A former secretary to Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> today joined the list of top political aides who reportedly made questionable stock dealings in a scandal spreading through the ranks of business and politics. In related developments, the president of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s leading economic newspaper and the chairman of the company whose stock was involved in the dealings resigned because of the scandal. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> told reporters today that one of his former secretaries, <PERSON> Ihei </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON>, earned profits by trading the shares of the real estate company Recruit-Cosmoined shares from the company then sold them shortly after it went public in 1986, when <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> was finance minister. The dealings were not illegal, but the revelations were on the front pages of almost all Japanese newspapers today and critics said the case highlights questionable ethics in the links between <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s politicians and businessmen. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> did not elaborate on the number of shares <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON> traded or his profits from the deal, but acknowledged that the scandal would seriously affect the upcoming session of the Diet, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s parliament He said he would not take responsibility for his aide's action. The controversy surfaced last month as a bribery case in a local government, but has entered a new dimension with a series of revelations that aides to leaders of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> profited with <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> stock. According to reports in the Japanese press, <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> gave stock or sold it at an artificially low price to high-ranking politicians. In some instances, the company reportedly lent money to politicians to buy the shares. When the company went public and the stock price soared, the politicians were able to reap large profits from a neglible initial investment. It was not clear what, if anything, the politicians did for <PERSON> Recruit-Cosmos </PERSON> in return. Not only politicians are involved in the scandal. The president of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s leading economic daily, <ORGANIZATION> Nihon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Keizai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, resigned Wednesday after it was revealed that he, <PERSON> Ko </PERSON> <PERSON> Morita </PERSON>, had dealt in <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> shares, violating the rules of his newspaper. <PERSON> Hiromasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> and its parent company <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a giant information service company, announced that he will resign the two chairmanships. The president of Recruit, <PERSON> Naotaka </PERSON> <PERSON> Ida </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON> will also withdraw from the government's tax commission. So far, the scandal has touched aides to Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON>; former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>; <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General and former Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Abe </PERSON>; former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> Director General <PERSON> Koichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kato </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Michio </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON>, the former minister of international trade and industry. Of them, only <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> has denied knowing of the stock deals, while the others said they had become aware their aides had received the stock and made profits. <PERSON> Saburo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsukamoto </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the third largest opposition party, was also found in the list of people who gained about $ 200,000 through the transactions. `` Whether they are politicians or company heads, those who have responsibilities must behave prudently not to be criticized by the general public,'' Chief Cabinet Secretary <PERSON> Keizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Obuchi </PERSON> told a press conference today in the only official comment from the government on the matter. Critics jumped on the case as an example of loose ethics in Japanese political life. `` Politicians want as much money as they can get, and businessmen always look for connections with politicians,'' said <PERSON> Shinji </PERSON> <PERSON> Otsuki </PERSON>, an editorial writer for <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, a major Japanese daily. He said the scandal will fuel public opposition to the tax reform package that the <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> government hopes to get through the special Diet session later this month. `` The Japanese public wo n't tolerate watching politicians earn huge profits by taking favors from businessmen in tricky ways very close to insider trading,'' <PERSON> Otsuki </PERSON> said. Legislation to ban insider trading took effect only in 1987, but is not retroactive. giving politicians stock shares that are guaranteed to rise. `` The only problem in this case, if there is any, is that the amount of money involved was unusually substantive and people who profited by the dealings were in positions where they are not supposed to be involved in such actions for ethical reasons,'' he said.

 A blind woman who was removed from an airplane in a dispute over seating and safety instructions says she wral rules may not prevent other blind people from being harassed. `` When I walk in an airport, I do n't know what's going to happen, but I know that it's likely to be demeaning and humiliating,'' <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinder </PERSON>, an officer of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blind </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday at the federation's annual meeting. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has proposed nine rules to end airline discrimination against disabled people. The rules were outlined at the conference by <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Scocozza </PERSON>, the department's assistant secretary for policy But Ms. <PERSON> Pinder </PERSON> challenged <PERSON> Scocozza </PERSON>, saying a clause in one of the rules could make it possible for airlines to continue barring blind passengers from sitting in emergency exit rows _ a practice the federation has criticized as discriminatory. Under one proposed rule, no passenger could be required to sit in a certain area of the plane, `` except where required by an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- safety rule,'' <PERSON> Scocozza </PERSON> told a predominantly blind audience of more than 1,000. <PERSON> Scocozza </PERSON> said in a speech to the convention that he agreed with the federation's position that many blind people are capable of sitting in an exit row and handling an emergency situation. But <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said his airline does not seat blind passengers in an exit row because of fears they could not assess an emergency situation as well as a sighted person. `` Let's say there's a fire on the other side -LRB- of the door -RRB-, a blind person would n't be able to see that,'' <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said. In April, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gashel </PERSON>, an officer of the federation, was taken into custody on a charge of criminal trespass after he refused to leave his seat in an emergency exit row of an <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> flight. Ms. <PERSON> Pinder </PERSON> said she was removed from a <ORGANIZATION> Midway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> plane on March 31 and arrested because she refused to move from a seat in the smoking section to the front of the plane. But <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for Midway, said Ms. <PERSON> Pinder </PERSON> was arrested because she refused to listen to a special safety briefing the airline requires for all disabled passengers. The federation's executive director, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Jernigan </PERSON>, told the convention that, `` no blind person anywhere in the country can board a plane without fear of harassment, public humiliation and possibly arrest and bodily injury.'' <PERSON> Scocozza </PERSON> said the department's new rules may help to change that situation. `` If nothing else, it's a start that's 30 years too late,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Mayor <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> said today that the first firebomb attack in Jewish west <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> since the Arab uprising began signals a dangerous escalation of anti-Israeli violence. Arab assailants hurled two firebombs Wednesday at an Israeli bus in west <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s busy commercial district. Police said there were no casualties. Although stone throwing and firebomb attacks have escalated recently in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, where 135,000 Arabs live, the attack Wednesday was the first time the violence has spread into Jewish west <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said the firebombing showed that the Arab uprising is a serious threat. `` This is additional evidence that all this struggle, this uprising, is not about territorial issues but is about the very existence of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. Also Wednesday, a brick was dropped from the roof of a commercial building in one of the most crowded areas of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, striking the roof of a car on the street below. <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> described the firebombing as `` a terrible danger for the present and the future.'' `` I think the assailants wanted to prove that in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, where life is relatively good compared with the territories, especially here they are in control,'' <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. Deputy Police Chief Rahamin Comfort told the radio the attack `` was a very severe incident. It has great importance because until now we did not have such a case.'' After the attack at about 10:30 p.m. on <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Street </PERSON>, a busy thoroughfare packed witIsraeli passersby drew their guns and chased the suspects. Police rushed to the scene, stopped Arabs to check their identification cards and rounded up 10 suspects for questioning. Witnesses told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the firebombs were hurled from the top of a building under construction and the gasoline-filled bottles struck the top of a passing bus before igniting on the street. The firebomb incident marked only the second time the downtown area of an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> city was targeted for unrest since the uprising began in December. On June 12, Palestinians hurled three firebombs from the roof of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>'s main shopping plaza. The attack did not cause injuries or damage. Police detained several Arab suspects. In east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, police closed two schools after <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> students burned tires and hurled rocks at riot police, said police spokesman <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapidot </PERSON>. One officer was slightly injured by a stone and one youth was detained, <PERSON> Lapidot </PERSON> said. Protesters also stoned two buses, and police arrested 11 Arab suspects, <PERSON> Lapidot </PERSON> said. In one attack, three Arabs fled into east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s central bus station, and police fired tear gas into the crowded terminal before capturing the assailants. In other developments Wednesday, the army extended for three days a closure order against all 800 Arabs schools in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Army officials have said the schools, which now will reopen Monday, are hotbeds of anti-Israeli violence. The <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s military government ordered Palestinian-run government hospitals to stop treating casualties of the uprising free of charge, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> doctors said Wednesday. The hospitals, funded by taxes paid by Palestinians, were ordered to charge all patients $ 175 a night and demand payment in advance for three nights, newspaper reports said.

 Benzene gas leaked from a factory in a residential part of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> and sickened more than 190 people, including nine who had to be hospitalized, an official report said Thursday. Most complained of feeling dizzy, weak and short of breath after the toxic gas spread Wednesday over <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Shenjiadu </LOCATION> neighborhood, the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Daily said. Doctors said the nine taken to the <LOCATION> Putuo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> were not seriously ill, the paper said. About 300 families live in the neighborhood, which is surrounded by half a dozen chemical factories. The report said a preliminary investigation pinpointed the <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> No. 9 <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fibre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Factory </ORGANIZATION> as the likely culprit. It said <PERSON> Shenjiadu </PERSON> residents have been complaining about air pollution for a long time, and the city has agreed to move them from the area. However, construction of new housing has been slowed by lack of money, the paper said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s cities are among the most seriously polluted in the world due to an intermingling of factories and apartment buildings, frequent lack of emission controls and heavy reliance on coal for home heating and to run machinery.

<HEAD>Construction Worker Unearths Valuable Medieval Treasure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A construction worker in a southwestern Polish town uncovered a medieval treasure pot, and other residents found out and scooped up some of the gold coins, Polish television reported. The 14th century treasure found in <LOCATION> Sroda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Slaska </LOCATION> is worth an estimated $ 6.9 million and consists of more than 1,000 gold coins minted in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> as well as a gold crown encrusted with precious stones, the report said. The valuables apparently were hidden in the 1340s when the black plague ravaged <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, according to the national evening TV news Wednesday. `` What was found in <LOCATION> Sroda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Slaska </LOCATION> could possibly be called the treasure of the millenium,'' said <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaletyn </PERSON>, director of the provincial archaeological and renovation center in nearby <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION>, in an interview with <PERSON> Dziennik </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludowy </PERSON>, the peasant party daily newspaper. When the unidentified construction worker's spade struck metal, he had no idea of the wealth buried beneath him. `` At first I thought those were just milk-bottle caps when I turned them over with my spade,'' the worker said on television. The public scramble to pocket the scattered coins caused police to move in to protect the find, the TV reported. Dozens of coins were recovered during a house-to-house search by police. One person was arrested and two youngsters with precious coins on them were detained outside a jewelery store in the nearby city of <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION>. Police believe that the public still has many pieces of gold and prosecutors are continuing an investigation to help recover the valuables for the state treasury, although the most valuable items have been recovered, <PERSON> Dziennik </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludowy </PERSON> said. Authorities say they will reward those who turn in their cache.

 Republican Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> asserted Thursday that tens of thousands of `` refugees'' are fleeing neighboring <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> each year to escape the policies of Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` You ought to stand at the border and talk to them when they come into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, who is active in Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential campaign, said in remarks at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. `` The state of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> in fact has the reality of between 50,000 and 100,000 leaving the state in the last five or six years. We in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> in fact get 10,000 to 20,000 refugees a year who escape with their families,'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said people are leaving <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, where the likely Democratic presidential nominee is governor, because `` they have perceived mismanagement, they have perceived a propensity to tax, they're not happy with the quality of service they receive.'' The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> governor has been speaking around the country on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' record as <LOCATION> Massachsuetts </LOCATION> governor as part of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s surrogate speaker program `` If <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> fulfills his promise to do for the rest of the nation what he did for <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, then we are in serious trouble,'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> asserted, saying <LOCATION> Massachsetts </LOCATION> ranks low in job creation. `` <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> is also the stolen-car capital of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. I would n't run around bragging about that,'' he said. On another matter, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said in response to a question that `` there would be a plus to considering a woman'' for the No. 2 spot on the Republican ticket. He contended that the Democrats have excluded women from consideration this year on their ticket. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said Sen. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON>, R-Kan., former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Ambassador <PERSON> Jeane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> as three Republican women who would make outstanding vice presidents At the same time, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said `` there would be a plus'' to considering a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential choice from a particular region of the country _ <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Asked if he were seeking the vice presidential post, or a Cabinet job in a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said: `` I have a very short horizon.

<TEXT>
 A nuclear weapons test rocked the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> desert today, registering 5.6 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale and causing a swaying motion in high-rise buildings here, 100 miles from ground zero. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Minsch </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earthquake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, said the reading indicated the test was one of the larger ones conducted at the desert site. The device was detonated 40 miles from Mercury, a tiny town on the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Test Site where Soviet nuclear scientists are based while preparing for a joint U.S.-Soviet test next month. A controller in the tower at <LOCATION> McCarran </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> said the tower rocked slightly seconds after the blast, at 8:05 a.m.. A telephone switchboard operator at <ORGANIZATION> Fitzgerald </ORGANIZATION>'s Hotel in downtown Las Vegas said a guest on the 29th floor called to ask why she felt ground motion And a receptionist at the Lionel, <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> law firm, atop a high-rise office building downtown, said she felt a `` dizzy, swirling feeling'' at the time of the blast. She said a hanging plant in the office began swaying. All three declined to give their names. Motion was recorded on <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> seismographs atop several hotel-casinos on the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and downtown. Motion was also recorded at Scotty's Castle in <LOCATION> Death </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, west of the test site. The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. An earthquake or explosion of 3.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale can cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe The test was delayed five minutes while controllers checked out a malfunctioning signal. <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON> said the test appeared to be normal, with no indications of any problems. West, who was in a control center 25 miles from ground zero, said monitors at the site indicated no radiation had escaped the ground. He said slight ground motion was felt in the control center. Today's test was the eighth conducted this year, and the sixth conducted with Soviet scientists on site. The Soviet scientists arrived earlier this year to begin preparing for next month's joint verification experiment. The Soviet scientists will monitor a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> test in mid-August and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> scientists will monitor a Soviet test a month later. The experiments are designed to determine the ability of each country to monitor the size of the other's tests. Such monitoring capabilities are critical in test limitation treaties. The DOE had issued a warning to managers of high-rise buildings in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> not to have workers in precarious positions at the time of today's detonation. Such warnings are issued only when the test is near 150 kilotons, the upper limits allowable under U.S.-Soviet treaties. The nuclear device was buried 2,000 feet beneath the surface of <LOCATION> Pahute </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, about 100 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. The most recent previous test was June 22, when two nuclear devices were detonated simultaneously in a rare experiment.

 Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> said today that drought-stricken counties no longer will have to get <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> clearance before approving emergency feed programs for livestock producers. <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> said he was told by <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> that an official announcement would be made soon. <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> disclosed the action to reporters after meeting with <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>. `` The -LRB- drought -RRB- counties will not have to make application to get approval here in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the emergency feed and emergency feed assistance program,'' <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> said. `` They can just notify <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> that they will be providing that -LRB- assistance -RRB- on an individual farmer-by farmer basis.'' <PERSON> Branstand </PERSON> said that to qualify, a farmer will have to show the county office of the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> that he has endured at least a 40 percent loss in normal feed stocks. `` This is going to avoid a lot of confusion and a lot of questions in the country, that are hurting the livestock producers,'' he said. `` And I think it is a very positive development.'' Under the emergency feed program, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> pays eligible livestock owners a portion of the cost of feed bought to replace that which is normally produced on the farm. The emergency feed assistance program allows the sale of USDA-owned grain at reduced prices _ 75 percent of the basic county price support loan rate. As of July 6, the feed programs were approved by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> for 474 counties in 22 states.

 A court Thursday agreed to hear arguments that <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> had scorned <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s judicial system in the cases stemming from the <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> gas disaster, according to a news report. A two-judge panel of the <ORGANIZATION> Madhya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pradesh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> accepted a petition accusing the <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, Conn.-based company of contempt of court, the <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. A hearing was ordered on the petition, but no date was announced, the news agency said. Union Carbide spokesman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Den </PERSON> <PERSON> Amelle </PERSON> said the company had no comment since it had not seen the report. The petition is the latest legal entanglement stemming from the 1984 <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> gas disaster in which nearly 3,000 people died. It alleges that <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> showed contempt for <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s court system by asking District Judge M.W. <PERSON> Deo </PERSON> to excuse himself from hearing a $ 3 billion damage suit filed by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> against the company, the news agency said. The company had argued that <PERSON> Deo </PERSON> showed bias in December when he ordered <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> to make relief payments to gas victims before a final decision had been made in the case. <PERSON> Deo </PERSON> rejected <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabide </ORGANIZATION>'s request June 16. Preliminary hearings in the damage case are under way in <PERSON> Deo </PERSON>'s court in <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Madhya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> The contempt of court petition was filed last month by <ORGANIZATION> Madhya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pradesh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advocate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A.M. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mathur </ORGANIZATION> and accepted Thursday by two judges in the city of <LOCATION> Jabalpur </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Number of Teacher Strikes Unchanged at 87, Group Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Public school teachers staged 87 strikes in 14 states in 1987-88, the same number as the year before, a group opposed to public employee unions said Thursday. But there were more teachers involved in the 876 walkouts and almost three times as many students missed classes, the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> said. It said 66,043 teachers went out on strike at some point during the school year that just ended, and 945,793 students missed classes. It said in 1986-87, there were 87 strikes in a dozen states, affecting 49,546 teachers and 326,431 students. The foundation, part of an organization that opposes collective bargaining for public employees, published the figures in its fortnightly newsletter, The Government Union Critique. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Katsirubas </PERSON>, editor of the newsletter, said that if a school district kept schools open with substitute or non-striking teachers, students were not counted as missing classes. The biggest strike last year was the 19-day walkout by 24,000 teachers in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, affecting 400,000 students. It was the ninth <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> strike in the past 19 years. The board of education had sought to freeze teachers' wages. <PERSON> Katsirubas </PERSON> said he tallied 71 teacher strikes in 1985-86 and 100 in 1984-85. Teacher union leaders contend there are fewer strikes these days and many of those that do occur are defensive ones. Teacher salaries have risen faster than inflation for the past seven years and the average teacher now earns more than $ 28,000, the highest ever in real dollars.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he will not promise to put blacks, women and other minorities in his Cabinet if elected president, even though he has made that commitment to Hispanic Americans. `` I feel strongly there should be an Hispanic in a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabinet </PERSON>,'' the vice president said Wednesday after addressing a Hispanic convention in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. `` Other groups have been represented in the Cabinet and Hispanics have not,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, certain to be the Republican presidential nominee. He said his promise to Hispanics was a one-shot pledge and that he would not go around the country making promises to special interest groups. On Capitol Hill, a group of <ORGANIZATION> Hispanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members today denounced <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s promise to name a Hispanic to his cabinet. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is making a last-ditch effort to make up for eight years of Republican neglect,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hispanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, D-Calif., said he had no confidence in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> making a meaningful appointment, saying the problem with the current administration is who they name to visible government posts `` They are tokens, people who they're able to manipulate and control. They do not believe in civil rights,'' he said. <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> said likely Democratic nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who also has promised to name Hispanics to high government posts, `` can back up his statement with his record.'' Today, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> invades <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' backyard to woo an ethnic group close to the heart of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor. The vice president will speak in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> tonight before a Greek Orthodox diocesean dinner. Aides said he would talk about the importance of religion. Underscoring the political importance of Hispanics, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> before the convention of the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> LULAC </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, the largest and oldest Hispanic civic group. Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does not speak Spanish, he arranged for his son, <PERSON> Jeb </PERSON>, to fly in from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to make a pitch for him. <PERSON> Jeb </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who speaks Spanish and is married to a woman from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, is popular with Hispanic groups. Pledging to put a Hispanic in his Cabinet, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, it was `` good to acknowledge that some things are, at this point, owed.'' He said his promise was something `` I have never made before, to anyone, to any group.'' However, he said, `` It is time. It is time and it's long overdue, and that is a solemn pledge.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vow to name a Hispanic to the Cabinet was `` about a year too late.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made the same pledge in June 1987 to the LULAC convention, held last year in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was to address the group on Thursday, followed by <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on Friday. At a news conference, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would not make similar promises to other groups. `` I will be very open-minded and broad-based in who I select to serve in my <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, but I'm addressing myself to righting a wrong that has been out there for many years.'' Asked if he would make a similar promise to Asian Americans, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I'd have to go back there and research that out.'' <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>, the Hispanic group's president, said of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, `` He attracted the attention of some voters who already decided on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Now they will pay attention to him.'' But <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON>, an influential Democrat whom <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> singled out by name as a person he had tried to recruit for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>, was unmoved by the vice president's promise to put a Hispanic in the Cabinet. <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON> said it was `` a little patronizing'' for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to make such a statement after serving eight years in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration without a Hispanic in the inner circle. `` The vice president needs to say to the president right now, ` We have goofed. We have not reciprocated to the Hispanic community''' for their support, said <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON>, a former chairman of <ORGANIZATION> LULAC </ORGANIZATION> and the head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hispanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had discussed the idea of a Hispanic in the Cabinet with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, but he added, `` I'm not president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' His commitment was a measure of the political importance of Hispanics, particularly in key battleground states like <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> which have a large Spanish-speaking population. Since 1980, the number of Hispanics in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has increased 30 percent, to 19 million, accounting for about 7.9 percent of the nation's population. Urging Hispanics to switch to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I think you belong with us. And do n't let anyone take you, or your support, for granted.'' Many people in the audience did not applaud, an indication they were not swayed by his appeal.

<TEXT>
 Last year's mild <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nino </ORGANIZATION>, a puzzling phenomenon in which global weather disruptions follow a warming of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, was predicted by three different climate models, according to scientists who hope they can now serve distant warning of future recurrences. `` Looking at the results ... we feel there is a good chance of being able to assess these things as much as a year ahead. And over time we expect to get better,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Zebiak </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Lamont-Doherty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>. `` Time will show how much value these kinds of models and predictions can have. Until there is a consensus on that, we do n't expect to see governments taking action readily based on them, although I do think that eventually that will happen,'' <PERSON> Zebiak </PERSON> said Thursday in a telephone interview `` It's a new kind of game, really, a lot of people are still quite skeptical about it.'' The successful predictions of the 1986-87 <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nino </ORGANIZATION> are being formally reported in Friday's edition of Science magazine. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Ninos </PERSON>, still not fully understood, are events that appear to affect weather around the world. One that occurred in 1982-83, described as the strongest in this century, was blamed for an estimated 1,500 deaths and damage of $ 2 billion to $ 8 billion worldwide. The 1986-87 El Nino had much less impact, although some unusual weather was reported, including heavy rains in coastal <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and drought in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The events are preceded by unusually warm water temperatures in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and changes in barometric pressure over that ocean. <PERSON> Zebiak </PERSON> said the climate studies currently show cooler than normal <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> temperatures _ the opposite of an <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nino </LOCATION> _ for at least the balance of this year. These cold events do not seem to have the climate impact of the warmer <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ninos </ORGANIZATION>, he added. <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ninos </ORGANIZATION> take their name from the Spanish word for child, a reference to the Christ Child. This was coined by Peruvian fishermen to refer to the recurring phenomenon, which sharply reduced their fish supply and was often first noticed at Christmas time. Scientists, combining that name with a reference to changes in <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> air pressure, usually use the term <ORGANIZATION> ENSO </ORGANIZATION>, for El Nino-Southern Oscillation. The three different climate models that predicted the 1986-87 <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nino </LOCATION> were: _ The Lamont-Doherty model developed by <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Cane </PERSON>, <PERSON> Zebiak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON> This model uses a computer to calculate changes in the ocean and atmosphere, and their relations with one another. Termed a `` dynamic'' model, meaning it uses mathematical formulas to calculate changes, it predicted the <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nino </ORGANIZATION> more than a year ahead of time. _ A model based primarily on changing ocean conditions, coupled with unusual wind currents, developed by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> and <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Legler </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> This combined dynamic and statistical information and can issue predictions a few months in advance, <PERSON> Zebiak </PERSON> explained. _ A statistical model using wind patterns and sea-level air pressure readings over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and Indian oceans, which can give predictions with lead times of 3 to 9 months This pair or related models was developed by <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanography </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jolla </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. In the case of the 1986-87 <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nino </ORGANIZATION>, all three models wound up making the same prediction, just at different times, <PERSON> Zebiak </PERSON> said. `` It is interesting that different models, which are based on quite different kinds of approaches, are showing consistency. I think it is basically encouraging, another piece of evidence that there really is a robust kind of signal here, which we are capturing in different ways.'' `` The fact is that these kind of forecasts are a reality now, they will continue. We and the other people are doing it sort of routinely now. What remains to be assessed is the kind of feeling for exactly how reliable they are going to be in the situations that nature throws our way,'' <PERSON> Zebiak </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Seattle Opera Won't Revive Ring Cycle Before 1991</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Seattle Opera is putting off its next mounting of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s four-opera Ring Cycle for at least two more years, company officials have announced. `` Der Ring des Niebelungen,'' a staple of the company since 1975, wo n't be revived before 1991, general director <PERSON> Speight </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said Wednesday. Instead, the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> will mount a production of <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s `` Die Meistersinger'' next year and <PERSON> Prokofiev </PERSON>'s `` War and Peace'' in 1990, he said He also announced the company balanced its 1987-88 budget `` with a slight surplus.'' <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> had planned to revive the Ring Cycle _ `` Das Rheingold,'' `` Die Walkure,'' `` Siegfried,'' and `` Gotterdammerung'' _ next summer after a one-year break in annual productions that had made the Opera House a mecca for <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> devotees from around the world. The Kennedy Center in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, is in the final stages of negotiation to host the Deutsche Oper <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s production of the operas next June. In May, the Metropolitan Opera of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> will present its new Ring. As a result, <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> fans would be drawn east next year. In 1990 the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> plans to revive its highly successful 1985 production of the operas. `` We will do the ` Ring' in 1991, unless a cataclysm strikes me or this company,'' <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> pledged. The production of the rarely heard `` War and Peace'' is planned in a collaboration with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in conjunction with the Goodwill Games. Negotiations for that production have yet to be concluded. An extended absence of the Wagnerian retelling of Teutonic legend wo n't mean the loss of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>'s reputation as a center for <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, but the expensive production ca n't be taken for granted, either, <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said. `` The Ring is not just going to be there, like <PERSON> Mount </PERSON> <PERSON> Rainier </PERSON>,'' he said. `` You have to work to earn and fund a Ring.'' He said it would be twice as expensive to revive the Ring cycle as to produce `` Meistersinger,'' which is expected to have a budget of about $ 1.2 million. The last new production of the opera in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was in 1977. To open its 25th season, the company is giving four performances this month of `` Satyagraha,'' an account of <PERSON> Mohandas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s years as a young lawyer in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> by the minimalist composer <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Glass </PERSON>.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> are `` in an untenable position'' and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s policy in the region needs to be reassessed following the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s downing of an Iranian airliner with 290 people on board, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said today. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> and other members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> attending a series of closed-door <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> briefings appear convinced that the captain of the USS Vincennes acted responsibly in launching the missile that destroyed an Iranian airliner with 290 people on board. In a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor speech, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said he is not advocating a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> withdrawal from the gulf, where American ships have operated for 40 years. He added: `` It's one thing to maintain our presence there. But it's another thing to go day to day in a volatile environment ... They are placed in an untenable position.'' He said he had asked <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> on Wednesday to `` give us a new assessment'' of threats to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in the shallow, crowded gulf. He said the new review is needed `` so we wo n't be going from day to day with the likelihood of this occurring again.'' <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, meanwhile, said after a closed meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was `` of course'' prepared for any Iranian reprisals. Declining to be specific, he said: `` We already have in place a very effective counter-intelligence strategy around the world, and it's being utilized. The one thing you do n't do in situations like this is panic and run to put the sand trucks up in place. `` Our government has procedures in place to protect our citizens and our officials who would be likely targets. And they are being utilized.'' House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, meanwhile, called Sunday's incident `` a very straightforward error of misidentification'' but said the Iranian government `` must assume some serious responsibility for this kind of an error'' because of the attacks by its gunboats on the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> just before the A-300 Airbus was shot down. Lawmakers said several factors _ the skirmish with Iranian patrol boats, electronic data that made the approaching plane appear to be military and intelligence information that indicated heightened chance of a major attack _ combined to justify the decision of the captain of the USS Vincennes to fire two missiles at an unseen target. `` The ship's captain had every reason in the world to feel threatened,'' Rep. <PERSON> Ike </PERSON> <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON>, D-Mo., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said after one briefing on Wednesday `` I do n't think he had any choice but to shoot it down. `` Every precaution the ship's commander could take was taken,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., noting that radar told the ship the approaching plane was descending from about 9,000 feet and gaining speed That information was at odds with data gathered by another ship in the area, the USS John H. Sides, which put the altitude as 12,000 feet and steady. That and other conflicts remain to be cleared up by a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigative team sifting through recorded information in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. Other unanswered questions included why the Airbus 300 passenger jet apparently was emitting electronic `` signatures'' for both a commercial plane and for a military craft. <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., said he believed the most likely explanation was that the code for a military plane was actually emitted by a second aircraft in the area, but was confused with the signal from the commercial plane by the sophisticated gear on board the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, an Aegis-class cruiser <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., said he believed it was too early to explain the dual civilian and military signals that seemed to be coming from the plane If a second plane were involved, `` suffice it to say that the captain could not have known that based on the information he had,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said. Little new information emerged from the three <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> briefings by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and a phalanx of subordinates. The Pentagon did back off from its earlier assertion that the Iranian airliner was flying outside the prescribed commercial air corridor, conceding that while the plane had deviated from the corridor's center, it had never actully left the designated airspace. Several lawmakers also said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces' nervousness had been heightened by specific intelligence warnings in the days before that a major attack on them was likely over the July Fourth weekend. <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said intelligence received in the days before the incident indicated that two Iranian F-14s had been moved from a military airfield elsewhere in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to the joint military-civilian airfield at <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s coastline. <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> also said the electronic `` signature'' picked up by the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> just before the shootdown bore the identical digital code that had been associated with F-14s flying in the area in the days before the incident. The failure to identify the jumbo jet shows that identifying aircraft electronically remains `` an art, not a science,'' he added. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday quoted military sources as saying Iranian commercial airliners have been used to carry soldiers from <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> _ the point of origin for <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> flight 655 _ to the front with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The sources said troop transports often have carried both civilian and military transponders, the radar-activated devices that broadcast a plane's identification signal. <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said lawmakers were told the plane was warned to identify itself at least a dozen times on both civilian and military frequencies, beginning within two or three minutes after it took off from <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> and before it turned to make a course correction, heading it toward the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>. In other developments: _ Lawmakers continued to be generally supportive of the idea of paying compensation to families of victims, which was being studied by administration officials `` I do not believe it would constitute any admission of guilt,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa. `` To have compensation awarded would be an act of generosity ... and would be very appropriate in this case. _ A <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-ABC </ORGANIZATION> poll published today found that 71 percent of the respondents believed shooting down the plane was justified while 23 percent disagreed The telephone survey of 524 randomly selected adults in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was conducted Tuesday and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. _ Soviet military staff chief Marshal <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> said at a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> news conference that he had discussed the incident with his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> counterpart, Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> said he had concluded that destruction of the Iranian jetliner differed from the Soviet shootdown of a <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> commercial flight over the Sea of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in 1983. `` I would not draw any similarities,'' he said.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s public security minister told the nation's police chiefs that counterrevolutionary activity, foreign-instigated sabotage and ordinary crime are increasing, it was reported Thursday. According to the official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, Minister <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> warned that `` sabotage instigated from abroad has been intensified recently.'' <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> did not elaborate, and it was not clear whether he was referring to sabotage against the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government or to last month's short-lived terrorist threat against Americans in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. He urged police to stay on their guard and recommended stiffer penalties for lawbreakers. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> already imposes the death penalty for numerous crimes, ranging from theft to panda poaching to murder. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> made his comments to more than 200 public security directors at the end of a national conference Wednesday. A day earlier, Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> told the gathering that public security must be tightened to control `` social upheavals'' that will inevitably result from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s ongoing economic reforms. Discontent with price increases, widening income gaps between poor and rich and student pressure for political freedom to match the new economic freedom all have contributed to growing tensions in Chinese society. Peasant raids on fertilizer warehouses, short-lived strikes over wages and other illegal and sometimes violent protests that would have been unheard of a decade ago have become more frequent. Three large illegal protests are known to have occured in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in June. About 1,000 <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students marched to Public Security headquarters on June 3 to protest the murder of a fellow student. A second planned march was thwarted by a police show of force. Several dozen students from the northeastern city of <LOCATION> Changchun </LOCATION> tried to hold a sit-in outside <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> headquarters a week later complaining that their study program was not accredited. More than 1,500 peasants in a village on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s outskirts clashed with police to try to halt the release of contaminated water into their drinking and irrigation water supply. Both the <LOCATION> Changchun </LOCATION> students and the peasants were dispersed forcibly. A series of statements by top officials during the month made it clear they have no intention of allowing the authority of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to be challenged. White collar and violent crime also have increased, partly because of the new social tensions and partly because <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economic reforms have increased temptations to steal The <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said crimes resulting in serious injury or death rose 31 percent in the first four months of the year, compared with the same period last year. Officials have said cases of gambling, prostitution and publishing pornography are increasing, and they have blamed <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s greater openness to the outside world <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> last month had its first known case of a terrorist threat against foreigners. Officials said nationals from an undisclosed third country plotted an attack on Americans in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, but were thwarted. No details were released.

<HEAD>Cuban Human Rights Activist Allowed to Visit United States</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In an unusual gesture, the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government has allowed a human rights activist and former political prisoner to make a monthlong visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Elizardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Cuban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reconciliation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said that he believes he is the first dissident to be given permission to leave <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> for purposes other than emigration since the start of the revolution 29 years ago. The main purpose of <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visit is to meet with his wife and children, who came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> aboard the Mariel boat lift in 1980. He plans to return to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in August. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> discussed the human rights situation in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in measured terms because he believes that strong language could jeopardize his hopes for positive changes on the island. `` We do n't want to corner the government,'' he said. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> spoke to a reporter Thursday shortly after his arrival in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, 44, is a former professor of philosophy and the history of philosophy who was stripped of his job in 1968 because of his unorthodox political views. Since then, he has spent seven years in prison because of his activities as a dissident. He now works in a municipal library in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>, although for many years the only jobs he could find were as a mechanic and a laundry employee, he said. He was last imprisoned in the fall of 1986 after speaking with reporters from two West European news agencies. The reporters were expelled from the country, and <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said he spent eight months in solitary confinement before his release last summer. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said he had applied repeatedly for permission to leave the country over the past eight years but his requests were ignored. In April, he finally got the go-ahead after he sent a telegram to President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> seeking his assistance. Asked if he is grateful for <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s help, <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said that permission to leave one's homeland is a right specified in the <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Declaration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> and that an expression of gratitude would therefore not be appropriate. `` It's a right that all should have,'' he said. During his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visit, <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said he expects to meet with representatives of the human rights groups, including <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Americas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION>, but he added that he is not seeking publicity. He described the human rights situation in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> as `` precarious'' and said the lack of individual freedoms is the most difficult problem. `` The current administration -LRB- in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> -RRB- has a lot to do to improve the situation,'' he said. Asked why he does n't plan to remain in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said there are enough Cubans outside the island who call attention to human rights practices there. `` The most important thing -LRB- for me -RRB- is to remain inside <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 With the tough competition of the `` Olympics of barbershop singing'' only a day away, hundreds of vocalists found harmony in hotel lobbies and halls as they belted out familiar tunes. But all bets were off today, when more than 1,000 barbershop quartet and chorus singers compete at the 50th International Convention of the Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barbershop Quartet Singing in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Fifty-one quartets will battle for five finalist positions, while 16 choruses of at least 50 men each vie for five spots. The finals are set for Saturday, with one gold, one silver and three bronze medals up for grabs in each category. The gold medal winners are the international champions. `` This is the Olympics of barbershop singing and all of them have had to battle on the local level to get here,'' international president <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, a lawyer from <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, said Wednesday. `` It will be a tough competition because there is a lot of prestige that goes with the medals.'' The competition may be fierce, but in virtually every corner of the <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and hotels Wednesday, many unfamiliar foursomes gathered like old chums and stretched their vocal chords. Barbershop quartets, which cropped up mainly on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> at the turn of the century and became popular during the vaudeville era, use four-part harmonies to carry tunes. The lead singer carries the melody. A tenor harmonizes and a baritone and a bass handle the lower chords. Barbershop quartets began fading when vaudeville was replaced by other forms of music and motion pictures in the aftermath of World War I. But in 1938, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cash </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, tax attorney, and <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, another <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> businessman, formed the barbershop quartet society to preserve the music. Today, there are 2,000 quartets and 800 choruses divided into 16 regions in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, as well as other groups in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. The organization, based in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, helped spawn two women barbershop singing groups, the <ORGANIZATION> Sweet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adelines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Harmony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` I think we are gaining some respect again across the country,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We are developing programs for young men in some high schools and it's found increasing acceptance,'' he said. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Zinke </PERSON>, 27, began singing in a quartet after being around his father's group. <PERSON> Zinke </PERSON>, who works in a tool and die shop in <LOCATION> High </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said he opted for barbershop quartet singing instead of rock' n' roll because of the selection of clean, simple old songs `` Just about anybody that has some kind of ear for music can do this; you do n't have to be a professional,'' <PERSON> Zinke </PERSON> said. `` You do n't have to be a fantastic singer to do this. I think that's what makes it so nice for the guy off the street who admires the music. He can come sing it, too,'' he said. `` It's easy to sing and it's portable,'' said 35-year-old <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` All you have to have is your pitch pipe and three other guys and you do n't have to call anybody to move your piano. It interacts with the audience in a real entertainment-kind of way.''

 Wildfires crackled through the country's parched forests, including a 10,000-acre blaze that threatened Mount Rushmore National Memorial and an 118,000-acre fire that burned within 10 miles of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline. More than 1,000 people had been evacuated by early today from the <LOCATION> Custer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> fire in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> near the granite monument to four presidents. In <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, hundreds of firefighters battled three of the state's more serious wildfires as weather forecasts continued to offer scant hope for rain The fire burning near the pipeline on the <ORGANIZATION> Yukon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> grew from 110,000 acres on Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. About 80 firefighters were assigned to the fire that is one of three the <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> either manned or monitored on the refuge. `` What they're trying to do is stop it from getting any closer to the pipeline,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. The pipeline is made of heavy-gauge steel and `` is not susceptible to serious damage from a fire of that nature,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. But, he said, `` We would rather not have it in the area of a pump station, because those are manned, for one thing.'' Firefighters in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> finished cutting fire lines today around an 850-acre blaze that has blackened oak, brush and <PERSON> Ponderosa </PERSON> pine in Zion National Park. They expected to have the fire contained by tonight, officials said. The fire began June 19 and was allowed to burn in a small `` conditional area'' in accordance with park policy allowing natural fires to take their course, said Chief Ranger <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>. On Sunday, however, winds gusting to 60 mph fanned the flames out of the conditional area, and up to 200 firefighters were brought in. In southern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, 45 firefighters battled a 3,500-acre fire that broke out late Wednesday on <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> and private land about three miles north of <LOCATION> Beryl </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> border. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Eulail </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> said the fire was 85 percent contained and crews anticipated full containment later today. Another fire in wilderness area that also began June 19, was being held in check at 3,400 acres in south-central <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. The lightning-caused fire was allowed to burn in the <ORGANIZATION> Absaroka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beartooth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> until it flared up over the Independence Day weekend and burned more than 1,600 acres. Smokejumpers worked the north face of the fire Wednesday while four helicopters dropped water and foam, said information officer <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnier </PERSON> in the Billings Interagency Fire Center. <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> firefighters, aided by cooler temperatures and a drop in winds overnight, contained a 1,300-acre fire in the <ORGANIZATION> Bridger-Teton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> at 6 a.m. today, forest officials said. Two volunteer firefighters were injured, one seriously, battling the blaze, said forest spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingwill </PERSON>. `` We still have a ways to go before we'll call it controlled,'' he said, adding that the wind in the next few days will determine the future of the fire. Officials originally said the fire had burned up 1,500 acres but downgraded the acreage to 1,300 after fire lines were dug and the blaze could be reassessed. In Yellowstone National Park, three fires covering nearly 1,900 acres of backcountry still were burning Wednesday. The fires, one covering 1,800 acres in the northwestern corner of the park and two others near <LOCATION> Shoshone </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> lakes in the southern part of the park, were not threatening any structures and were being allowed to burn themselves out. Farther east, six small forest fires burned on in northeast <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. Three of the fires were caused by weekend fireworks and three by arson, said <LOCATION> Lackawanna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> Forester <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Santoli </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Scranton </LOCATION>. The largest fire burned more than 75 acres of woodland on Montage Mountain, near <LOCATION> Moosic </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Santoli </PERSON> said. The other large fire charred about 60 acres at <LOCATION> Campbells </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ledge </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Duryea </LOCATION>.

 Workers at the Point Defiance Zoo and Aquarium are trying to keep alive a newborn harbor porpoise orphaned on a beach. The pup, named `` Indy'' because it was discovered on Independence Day, is believed to be only the second immature harbor porpoise kept alive in captivity, said <PERSON> Lily </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, zoo information officer. A pup found last year at Point Defiance died within four months, and zoo officials said chances for the new baby porpoise's survival also are slim. Two young girls playing on the beach at the <LOCATION> Necanicum </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> estuary near <LOCATION> Seaside </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, found the pup. The umbilicus _ the navel which quickly disappears _ was evident and the pup's dorsal fin was flaccid, which indicates a young age, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. `` It's in very good shape, considering all that it's been through,'' she said. `` It conceivably could have been born on the day the girls found it.'' The porpoise arrived at the zoo Tuesday afternoon, measuring 33 inches long and weighing 16 pounds. Harbor porpoises will grow to about 5 feet long, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. Visitors ca n't see the harbor porpoise because officials are trying to minimize stress on it.

 An 11-year-old boy accompanied by a retired <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pilot ace today flew off on his quest to retrace <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindbergh </PERSON>'s historic flight to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, a 7,000-mile journey. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oceano </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>, 46, departed from <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> at 8:32 a.m. today on the first leg of their trip to <LOCATION> Kerrville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The two, flying the first leg in a borrowed plane, will trade it for a new <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON> 252 aircraft built for the trans-Atlantic journey. Takeoff was originally scheduled for Monday, but was delayed by storms in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. In 1927, <PERSON> Lindbergh </PERSON> flew from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, then to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> before completing his 33 -LCB- - hour non-stop solo flight across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Because <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> is limiting the boy's flying time to less than eight hours at a time, the trip will stretch out over five days and include stops in <LOCATION> Kernville </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>.; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>; Sondestrom, <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>. According to <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>, the flight to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> would make him the world's youngest trans-Atlantic pilot. `` I'm very happy,'' he said shortly before takeoff. `` I am an ambassador to the youth of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and I want to show all the youth that if I can do my dreams, anyone can.'' He said `` trying to stay awake'' would probably be the most difficult part, `` but I will.'' `` I'm not going to touch the controls unless there's an emergency. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>' aviation skills are phenomenal,'' <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> said. The youngster has logged 200 hours, compared to <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>'s more than 7,000 miles <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>, the son of a commercial air pilot, gained fame last August when at age 10 he became the youngest aviator to fly across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In April, however, a 9-year-old from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Capistrano </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Aliengena </PERSON>, broke the record by making a California-Massachusetts round trip. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> and his mother, <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, who live about 15 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, recruited <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> for this trip after meeting him at an air show last year. <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>, a retired <LOCATION> Miramar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, commander, was the only <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pilot ace in the Vietnam War and is the most-decorated <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pilot, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> said.

Starting off the 10-week conference session, <PERSON> Theorin </PERSON> said the U.S.-Soviet treaty eliminating intermediate-range nuclear missiles `` a major breakthrough for nuclear disarmament.'' She expressed hope the two superpowers will agree soon on halving their long-range nuclear arsenals. But indications that additional countries have stockpiled chemical weapons and their increasing sophistication give rise to `` grave concern,'' she told delegates to the world's only multilateral arms negotiating body. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> have failed to agree on a deadline or any concrete commitment to speed the conference's 20-year negotiations on a comprehensive chemical weapons ban, she said. Several outstanding issues, including details of verification, could be settled `` if good will persists,'' she said. `` Time is not on our side.'' On nuclear testing, she said a comprehensive ban `` is as urgent as ever.'' She noted more than 1,600 atomic test explosions were set off by the end of last year and all five nuclear weapons states carried out tests in 1987. The U.S.-Soviet talks on nuclear testing should focus on limiting the number of tests as a step toward a comprehensive ban, <PERSON> Theorin </PERSON> said.

 It's enough to make you swear off water. <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON> <PERSON> Forney </PERSON> was in her kitchen six years ago, with her hand on the faucet when lightning struck just outside. `` I guess it went through the pipes or something, but it threw me all over the kitchen, into the refrigerator and the table and onto the floor.''

<HEAD>Heat Blamed for 15 Deaths, Sends More Than 400 to Hospital</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A five-day heat wave blamed for 15 deaths combined with heavy smog in the <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> basin Thursday to send more than 500 people to hospitals, most with heart and breathing problems. Hospitals around the country were place on alert. Temperatures in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> reached 106 degrees Fahrenheit at 2:45 p.m. for the second straight day. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s northern neighbor, reported at least 26 people dead in a heat wave that has gripped <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> for a week. The temperature soared to 104 degrees Wednesday. The Greek national weather service said temperatures were not expected to drop until Sunday. `` The smog of <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> sent 496 people to hospital with cardiac and respiratory problems as pollution reached murderous levels,'' said a statemment by the <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ecologic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. A report from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Help </ORGANIZATION> said 404 people were treated as outpatients for heart or breathing difficulties and 92 were hospitalized. It said hospitals admitted 25 people suffering from heat stroke. <PERSON> Nikos </PERSON> <PERSON> Benardis </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> coroner, said the heat contributed to the deaths of 15 elderly people. `` Most of them had previous heart conditions and were on medication,'' he said. `` The heat certainly aggravated the condition of those with cardiac problems that caused their deaths.'' Soaring temperature have caused a shortage of electric fans and hundreds of people lined up at appliance stores for the few that remained. `` We had 60 fans in the store and sold them all within minutes of opening. There are people who have been waiting two or three days to buy one,'' said <PERSON> Efthimios </PERSON> <PERSON> Arevas </PERSON>, sales manager of a large appliance stores. He reported receiving orders from `` hospitals and even the army for 30 fans that we do n't have. It's worse than last year.'' One year ago, more than 900 people died in a 10-day heat wave. Lack of air conditioning in city hospitals was blamed for many of the deaths. <PERSON> Sismanogleion </PERSON> <PERSON> Hospital </PERSON> said crews were installing more air-conditioning units and the medical staff was on 24-hour alert. The environmental study center said smoke, nitrogen dioxide and total suspended particles in the <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> atmosphere were four to five times danger levels. No figures were available from the government <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pollution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> because a bomb wrecked its offices early Wednesday. The leftist group <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Struggle </ORGANIZATION> said it planted the bomb to protest environmental pollution. <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> has been plagued for years by the brown mass of pollutants that forms in the lower atmosphere on warm, still days and is known as the nefos, the Greek word for cloud. Government anti-pollution measures introduced in January have failed to eliminate it.

<HEAD>House Republicans Introduce Family Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 House Republican leaders unveiled an `` American Family Act'' on Thursday, saying they hoped the bill would win Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s backing and influence issues ranging from child care to gang-busting. `` It is not enough for Republicans to deride the failures of the Great Society programs. We must provide a framework for change,'' House Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, R-Ill., said at a news conference The $ 2 billion package would provide federal support for promising state, local and private programs designed to strengthen the American family. Though they'll introduce the legislation in August, sponsors are really shooting for action in the next <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ind </LOCATION>., the principal author of the bill Sponsors also want to make the bill part of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> platform and are hoping <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the all-but-certain GOP presidential nominee, will endorse it in whole or in part. One of the sponsors is Rep. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, R-Calif., co-chairman of the Republican Convention Platform Committee Specifically, the bill contains the following initiatives: _ Up to $ 50 million to states for experiments in school-based management, in which teachers play a major management role and districts have greater budget and curriculum flexibility _ $ 50 million to promote unrestricted school enrollment policies aimed at forcing schools to compete. _ Up to $ 450 million for `` bootstrap schools'' which have predominantly minority or low-income students _ $ 600,000 for `` character education'' pilot programs and promotion. Grants would be available only to schools that require the Pledge of Allegiance daily. _ College savings bonds, with tax-exempt interest if proceeds were used for tuition and other costs associated with higher education of the taxpayer, spouse, child or dependent Such legislation has already been introduced with the backing of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. _ A $ 1.3 billion proposal targeting aid to low-income working families, already introduced by Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, _ A multimillion-dollar program to fight gang warfare, including $ 5 million to encourage states to adopt restitution laws, $ 7 million to states with laws allowing courts to find parents liable for restitution, $ 3.5 million for law enforcement areas that want to set up a tracking system for juvenile Also, there would be grants for community reclamation and other projects. _ Child support enforcement initiatives, including mandatory automatic wage withholding and a requirement that at least 17 percent of a non-custodial parent's income go to support one child _ Allowing public housing authorities to charge no more than fair-market rent for housing Currently, families pay 30 percent of their gross incomes. _ $ 10 million in start-up money for projects that coordinate services to high risk children. The Republicans said they are planning a second family package to address the issues of housing, work and family, and possibly health. It is unclear, they said, whether the next bill will include a provision guaranteeing new parents job-protected leave. `` There's a lot of controversy about it,'' Coats said of such a requirement for parental leave, an idea promoted by Democrats and some Republicans but strongly opposed by business. `` We've resisted the temptation to pick up a politically charged issue and throw something out there that we're not 100 percent comfortable with.''

<HEAD>U.S. Company To Buy Hi-Tech From China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company announced Thursday it will buy advanced technology from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, an unusual agreement that reverses the roles of the two countries in most high technology transfers. The company, <ORGANIZATION> EG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, will buy technological know-how and components for developing a helium magnetometer used for geophysical mapping and minerals exploration, said <ORGANIZATION> EG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; G Chairman and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kucharski </PERSON>. The technology will be provided by the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Import </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, under the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geology </ORGANIZATION> and Mineral Resources. `` This is the first time for the ministry to cooperate with an American company to export technical products to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>,'' said Vice-Minister <PERSON> Xia </PERSON> <PERSON> Guozhi </PERSON>. EG & amp; G, a Massachusetts-based high technology company with an 18-year history in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, previously had sold technology to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but this is its first time on the buying end. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has shared scientific and technological knowledge, especially in the areas of agriculture, with African countries. It just signed an agreement with <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> to develop and launch two scientific satellites in a joint venture. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last fall briefly froze further liberalization of high technology transfers to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to protest alleged sales of Chinese Silkworm missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Bilateral trade last year reached $ 10.4 billion, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> statistics. Under the six-year agreement, <ORGANIZATION> EG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; G will use Chinese know-how to develop the helium magnetometer, which will be produced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and sold on the international market. The instrument can be used on airborne, marine and portable land-based systems for mapping the Earth's magnetic field. EG & amp; G made no payments on the technology. Instead, the Chinese company will be paid on a royalty-basis. Neither side would reveal the amount. <PERSON> Kucharski </PERSON> told reporters that sales of the magnetometer are expected to exceed $ 10 million. <PERSON> Bian </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhaohao </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Import </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said the amount of money his company will earn is small, but added that the significance of technology transfer from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was far more important than the profits. `` In this way, we would like to create various forms of cooperation not only with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> but with other countries as well,'' he said, adding the agreement reflects <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s policy of encouraging transfers and cooperation with other countries in the development of technology.

 An armada of rescue ships and helicopters scoured the chilly <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> today for 150 people missing after a fire engulfed an oil platform in possibly the worst oil rig disaster ever. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> the owner of the rig, said in a statement that a gas leak was apparently to blame. <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON>, a survivor, described hearing a gas leak `` screaming like a banshee'' seconds before an explosion ripped through the <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> platform. Flames continued to leap into the air above the burning wreck of twisted metal. Two explosions triggered Wednesday night's inferno on the <LOCATION> Piper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alpha </LOCATION> rig, 120 miles off the Scottish coast. Police said there was little hope of finding any more survivors. Energy Secretary <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> that 229 people had been on the oil platform. He said 65 survived and 16 bodies were found, leaving 148 missing. In addition, two of three rescuers who disappeared still were missing. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> said 66 men survived and police said 67. The discrepancies were not immediately explained. Police said most workers on the rig were Scottish, but <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the domestic news agency, said workers from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, continental <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> were aboard. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> headquarters had no immediate information on how many Americans were aboard the rig, said spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>. <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement: `` I wish to extend my deepest personal sympathy to the families of the men who have been injured or who have lost their lives in this tragic accident in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. We will continue to do everything we can to assist the injured and their families.'' If those missing are confirmed dead, the accident will be the world's worst oil rig disaster. The Guinness Book of Records lists the worst as the capsizing of the <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kielland </PERSON> platform in Norwegian waters in March 1980, when 123 people died. `` It was a case of fry and die or jump and try,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON>, 45, who managed to leap off the <LOCATION> Piper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alpha </LOCATION> into the 57-degree water after he was choked by smoke. Towering flames lit up the night, and smoke blackened the sky today. `` With the passage of time, hopes are fading of finding any other survivors,'' said a police statement. Six <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> warships diverted from maneuvers to join the search that filled the skies with helicopters and the waters with more than two dozen boats. Sleeping workers died when flames raced through the <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION>'s living quarters. Others leaped 150 feet into the water. The <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> guard </ORGANIZATION> said rescuers from a rescue vessel, the <LOCATION> Sandhaven </LOCATION>, disappeared into the flames as they headed to the rig in a small boat and a second explosion occurred. Police said two were missing. Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> sent a message of sympathy and Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> expressed deep shock. <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION> hospital spokesman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> told reporters 21 people were hospitalized, 13 of them in serious condition. <PERSON> Carey </PERSON>, an instrument technician, lay in a hospital bed with his arm in a sling and his eyes closed by burns. He said he was choked by smoke after hearing the first of two explosions. `` It was over the side or nothing. I just dived. It may have been 60 feet. I was totally enveloped,'' he said. A second explosion sent bits of lifeboat raining into the water, he said. `` There was a lot of debris floating around and the flames were billowing above us. I found my head was being cooked. I had to keep ducking down to get it cool.'' He saw bodies float past and then was rescued. Dr. <PERSON> Alistair </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheson </PERSON> of the Royal Infirmary, who treated injured aboard a rescue ship close to the rig, said, `` There was a strange silence about the place. I could feel the heat of the flames in my face. I knew this was a disaster of major proportions.'' <PERSON> Matheson </PERSON> said survivors told of taking refuge in a cool area of the rig, and, when the flames approached, finding nowhere to jump where the sea was clear of flames. Two who jumped survived. `` Those who were lucky and able to escape were up and at work at the time and were able to jump straight into the sea and get into rescue vessels,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brading </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president, told a news conference. He announced an urgent inquiry into why lifeboats with room for 300 people failed to get off the platform. Witnesses said the flames engulfed the rig and towered over the horizon. `` When we went on late last night, we certainly could see the fire raging from 60 to 70 miles away and the flames at that time were, we'd estimate, 300 or 400 feet,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION> Leader <PERSON> Garfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, who was involved in the rescue. It was the third accident at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil installations in the past week. On Friday, a blast rocked <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION>'s Sullom Voe onshore terminal on the <LOCATION> Shetland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, a fire broke out on the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> Brent Alpha platform. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> is one of the major oil companies operating in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. It has been concentrating recently on developing new fields there. Serious incidents have regularly occurred on <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> drilling, production and accommodation platforms since the start of the off-shore exploration boom in the 1960s. Structural defects, explosions or bad weather have all been to blame.

 Government regulators more than doubled their estimate today of how much it will cost to bail out <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' ailing savings and loans institutions, telling a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee that it now appears the bill will be $ 15.2 billion. Chairman <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that to help pay for the bailouts, his agency will raise an additional $ 12.3 billion, mostly by extending the special assessment the thrifts now pay on their deposits. Panel chairman <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, asked Wall if he envisioned needing taxpayers' help in footing the bill `` in the not too distant future''. Wall responded, `` No, when you added ` not too distant future'.'' The bank board had been saying that it expects the costs of merging, selling or liquidating thrifts in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to be $ 7 billion. Wall also said he expected his agency to be able to raise $ 42.5 billion over the next decade for bailouts across the country, an increase from earlier projections of $ 30.2 billion.

 A new test to quickly estimate blood cholesterol levels won approval Thursday from the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The new device, quicker and easier to use than current tests, uses a drop of blood on a chemically treated card that changes color according to the amount of cholesterol in the blood. The test, to be available for use by physicians, is intended only as a preliminary screening technique to identify people with elevated cholesterol levels who may need treatment. People with high readings on the screening test should receive further evaluation with conventional lab tests, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. The new test does not give a count, but indicates whether the sample tested falls within three ranges: below 200 milligrams per deciliter, from 200 to 300 milligrams or over 300 milligrams. Federal officials health officials urge further evaluation for anyone with a level above 200 milligrams per deciliter. The new test, called `` Clinicard,'' is made by <ORGANIZATION> Chem-Elec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Webster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, and will be available on a limited basis in about a month, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said.

 A runaway forest fire that swept near <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rushmore </LOCATION> before turning aside today charred more than 10,000 acres and prompted evacuation of up to 1,000 residents and tourists near the national memorial, authorities said. `` When we told them -LRB- residents and campers -RRB- it was burning 1,000 acres per hour ... and it was three miles away, they kind of believed us,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Pennington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, who helped evacuate the town of <ORGANIZATION> Keystone </ORGANIZATION> late Wednesday. Visitors returned to <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rushmore </LOCATION> this morning, but it was accessible only from the west. Superintendent <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wenk </PERSON> said smoke was visible in the distance today, but there was no smoke at the memorial itself. The blaze, which shot billows of smoke so high its pall was visible 160 miles away Wednesday, also threatened the park's Game Lodge, summer White House for two presidents. No structures have been destroyed. `` It's a very serious situation,'' <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagen </PERSON>, fire information officer with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said early today. The fire in <LOCATION> Custer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> was within three miles of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rushmore </LOCATION> before switching directions and heading south, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hohmann </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state division of forestry. `` The fire behavior was so extreme and erratic that the fire line was lost several times'' during the night, forcing firefighters to retreat, <PERSON> Hohmann </PERSON> said. Since there are fewer buildings in the southern end of the park, firefighters can now spend more time battling the blaze and less time protecting structures, <PERSON> Hohman </PERSON> said. An estimated 1,000 firefighters, pilots and rescue personnel are battling the blaze, <PERSON> Hohmann </PERSON> said. A three-mile-long fire line has been cleared, but 20 more miles are needed to surround the blaze. He estimated the line would be completed Sunday night. Cooler temperatures and lighter winds were forecast today, which could help the fire-fighting effort, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Farver </PERSON>, fire information officer. Two firefighters suffered minor injuries, <PERSON> Hagen </PERSON> said. All entrances to the park were closed Wednesday. The fire was fueled by a continuing drought that has created extremely dry timber. Smoke was billowing thousands of feet into the air and the plume was visible from <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> 25 miles away. A haze from the smoke hung over a large part of western <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and was visible from <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON>, 160 miles away. <LOCATION> Pennington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's officials knocked on doors in the tourist town of <ORGANIZATION> Keystone </ORGANIZATION> and at the memorial asking people to leave early today, <PERSON> Hagen </PERSON> said. He estimated between 300 and 400 people were being evacuated; 600 were evacuated earlier from <LOCATION> Custer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. `` There was a continuous line of cars from <ORGANIZATION> Keystone </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION>, but from all reports it went smoothly,'' <PERSON> Hagen </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Keystone </ORGANIZATION>, about two miles from <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rushmore </LOCATION>, has only about 300 residents, but it attracts thousands of tourists. A National Guard official in <LOCATION> Custer </LOCATION> estimated Wednesday night that 1,500 to 2,000 people would have to leave the area because it is the height of the tourist season. Neither the town nor the monument was in immediate danger this morning, but the evacuation was a precaution in case the fire expands in their direction, said a dispatcher at the fire center who refused to give his name. Employees who work at <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rushmore </LOCATION> and park officials also were asked to leave, <PERSON> Hagen </PERSON> said. Evacuees fled to a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> shelter in <LOCATION> Rapid </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> or to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> armory in <LOCATION> Custer </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Menashe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abigail </PERSON> <PERSON> Barzilai </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Winnipeg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, their month-old baby and two other children were five of the approximately 170 people who spent the night at the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> shelter. The Barzilais, who had been staying at a <ORGANIZATION> Keystone </ORGANIZATION> motel, were evacuated from <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rushmore </LOCATION> during the evening lighting ceremony, in which the granite faces are illuminated by floodlights. `` We left all of our things in a motel, including the passports,'' <PERSON> Barzilai </PERSON> said today. `` Now we ca n't go back,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Barzilai </PERSON> said. `` About the fire, I was n't worried, but about the passports I was and I do n't have anything for the baby.'' Authorities believe lightning started the fire in the north-central part of the 73,000-acre park Monday night. It was not spotted until Tuesday afternoon. The fire burned across the park's northern boundary and entered <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> land Wednesday night. `` It makes you just sick to see the damage that's being done,'' said Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mickelson </PERSON>, who toured the area by helicopter Wednesday night. Firefighters brought in bulldozers to build a line around the park's State Game Lodge and sprayed water on it to save it. The 66-year-old lodge was the summer White House for presidents <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Coolidge </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Custer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> is the second-largest state park in the nation. It includes the world's largest publicly owned bison herd at 1,500 animals. The bison graze mostly in the southern part of the park, away from the fire, but the blaze is burning in some of the prime habitat for the rare big horn sheep.

 Statehood did n't immunize <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> from hard times _ oil prices are down and there is no more boom in the economy _ but a leader in the campaign for a 49th star on the flag has no regrets. `` Statehood has done everything Alaskans said it would do for them,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statehood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said as the state marked one of its 30th birthdays. It was on July 7, 1958, that President <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> signed the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> statehood bill into law. Some consider the anniversary to be June 30, the date in 1958 that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed the bill to admit the huge territory into the union. Still others cite Jan. 3, 1959, when <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> signed the proclamation admitting <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. None of the dates is drawing much attention this year. The list of official <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> holidays notes instead Seward's Day in March and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Day in October. Seward's Day marks the 1867 signing of the treaty by which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> purchased <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> from the Russians. Alaska Day recognizes the formal transfer of the territory and the raising of the flag at <LOCATION> Sitka </LOCATION> in 1867. The struggle for statehood spanned 10 years, said <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON>, publisher of the <ORGANIZATION> Anchorage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` We had our issues over statehood in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>: Would it be good for <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and Alaskans,'' he said. `` But <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wanted to know would statehood be good for the nation. They did n't give a hoot about what would be good for <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>.'' Politically, <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON> said, trying to gather votes among the nation's lawmakers was `` like trying to line up 1,000 dominoes so that when you knock one down, they all fall.'' Representatives from some of the Southern states worried <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> would send <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> liberal congressmen who would bolster the civil-rights movement, he said. `` <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> did n't want to lose the title of the biggest state,'' remembered <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON>, who moved to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> in 1935. `` They joked about it, but it was a real concern to them.'' He said opposition within <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> came from the canned salmon industry. `` They controlled the economics and the politics of the territory,'' he said. With statehood accomplished, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> went through governmental changes that <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON> believes helped lure investors north. Previously, he said, companies with money to stake were held back by concerns about the amount of power exerted in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> by the Secretary of the Interior. Before statehood, <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON> said, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> was a colony run out of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told Southeast Asian leaders Thursday they do not stand alone in dealing with the tide of refugees still fleeing <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> 13 years after the end of the war. `` The commitment of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to resolve the Indochinese refugee problem is as strong today as it has been in the past,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` We have come a long way ... Now we solemnly recommit ourselves to stay the course.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> admitted a long-standing policy by Southeast Asians to grant temporary asylum to the refugees was in jeopardy and proposed a mix of strategies, including a Bangkok-based working group that would `` craft new approaches.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> spoke at the opening session of a three-day `` dialogue'' among the foreign ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and close partners <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He arrived Wednesday at the start of a nine-country tour of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> amid tight security. <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> officials reinforced police and military security personnel in the wake of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> downing of an Iranian airliner in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> on Sunday. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told reporters traveling with him that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was concerned and alert to the possibility of a response from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which he accused of supporting terrorism. Focusing on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remained `` unalterably opposed'' to the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> returning to power in that country. He urged strong support for resistance leader Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, with whom he confers Friday, and non-communist groups fighting the Vietnamese in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. `` They represent the political alternative to the Vietnamese occupation and the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and are key to a <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> settlement,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. He said continued pressure had to be exerted on <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to withdraw all its forces from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, but added: `` We look forward to the time when <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> will rejoin the community of nations.'' In a closed session, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> expressed `` cautious optimism'' about the results of talks this month in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> among the warring sides in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION> also are to take part in the talks beginning July 25. `` We do not have an independent plan,'' the spokesman told reporters. `` Our position is supportive of <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remains unalterably opposed to the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> ever again taking control in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, and we believe it is essential that any settlement have adequate safeguards to prevent this,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sosuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> called for an international peacekeeping force in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and said his country would consider funding and manning such a force. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s forces invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978, driving the murderous <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> from power and into the jungles where they and two non-communist groups continue to battle the Vietnamese and the pro-Hanoi government in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> leads the three-party resistance. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> regards normalization of relations with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in context of a solution in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> must realize that our commitment to a free and independent <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> is unswerving,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. The secretary stressed that the issue of nearly 1,800 Americans still listed as missing in action in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> also continues `` to divide our two peoples.'' `` We believe it is critical for <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to move on this issue this year,'' he said. `` You do not stand alone,'' he said, referring to nations in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> providing first asylum to refugees from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Communist forces triumphed in those countries in 1975. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s proposal for a refugee working group, which would include <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION>, the dialogue partners and the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees, received favorable comments from some of the delegates. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should discourage clandestine flights from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, continue to resettle refugees and get <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to expand a U.N.-sponsored Orderly Departure Program. Facing a fresh surge of Vietnamese boat people, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> are adopting tougher measures. They claim that most of the new arrivals are economic migrants rather than people fleeing political persecution. In 1986 the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accepted about 36,000 Indochinese refugees who had sought temporary asylum in other parts of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. This fiscal year, the number is about 29,500. Since 1975, more than 900,000 Indochinese refugees have settled in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>House Chairman Assails Proposed Alaska Land Swap</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A House subcommittee chairman accused the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday of trying to muster political support for oil exploration in an <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> wildlife refuge through a swap of its potential oil-bearing tracts for land in other refuges. Such a swap could kill any chance that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would approve exploration, said Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> water and power resources subcommittee <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> held hearings on a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report released Wednesday that said the land swap, as agreed to by the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and six native corporations, should be abandoned. The analysts from <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said the service had valued the swap at six times the appraised value of the refuge tracts, $ 539 million vs. $ 90 million, and would get much land already protected from development or without much wildlife value. The swap would transfer 896,000 acres of surface rights to native holdings in seven refuges to the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in exchange for mineral rights to 160,000 acres in the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> on the state's northeastern coast. The department claims it would still hold about two-thirds the value of the oil, if any is there. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has defended the exchange in a 20-page technical critique, calling the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report full of errors and misunderstandings, and has promised an even more detailed response. But <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> wrote <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last month he had decided not to proceed with the required environmental impact statement, which requires public hearings, for the moment. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> regional director of the <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> when the exchange was negotiated last year and now assistant to the director in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, told the subcommittee among other things that the appraised values suffer from `` a fatal flaw:'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> forbade the use of condemnation proceedings. `` I feel the taxpayers are getting an excellent bargain, considering the fact there's no assurance there's oil'' under the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, commented, `` That means -LRB- the native corporations -RRB- have got an 81 percent chance of not getting anything.'' The department has estimated there is a 19 percent chance of finding oil, and if any is there, there is a 50 percent chance that the field would total 3.2 billion barrels and a 5 percent chance of 9 billion barrels, as large as the <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> field about 100 miles away. `` This never was designed to be a resource management system,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said at the close of <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON>'s testimony. `` This was designed to be a lobbying system ... to generate support for opening up'' the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> to drilling. `` That's why the economics stink. It's a very, very cynical approach to this issue,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> continued. `` If there's an insistence that this is part of the bargain, then it is fatal to those deliberations. This is so far outside the realm of the public interest that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ca n't possibly accept it.'' Asked in the hallway if he wanted to respond, <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> said, `` Since he did n't give me the opportunity to, I do n't choose to now.'' He said he was `` a little frazzled'' by <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s attacks. Asked if the trade were part of a plan to generate lobbying support, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> said, `` It's not.

 The mother of a girl born prematurely aboard a cruise ship in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> said Thursday she'll take another cruise _ but she wo n't get pregnant again. `` This is the last one. This is enough,'' agreed husband <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON>, as he and his wife told reporters they have named their daughter <PERSON> Emera </PERSON> <PERSON> Cay </PERSON> to note the circumstances of her birth. The 2-pound, 11-ounce baby was born Wednesday, seven weeks premature, in the infirmary of the Emerald Seas as the ship made its stop at <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stirrup </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cay </LOCATION> after leaving <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. Hence the name, Emera Cay. The baby was in serious but stable condition Thursday at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Childrens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Ava </PERSON> <PERSON> Osle </PERSON>, who said it was too early to predict how long the baby will be hospitalized The mother, <PERSON> Wylene </PERSON> <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON>, said she wants to leave <ORGANIZATION> Broward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Lheri </PERSON> <PERSON> Domond </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON> probably will be released Friday. `` Everything is going great.

A cruise line spokesman said the McCollums will get another cruise, free of charge, when they're ready. The <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> couple also has a 2-year-old daughter. The Emerald Seas, which makes regular runs from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, was anchored off <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stirrup </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cay </LOCATION> on Wednesday morning when Mrs. <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON> gave birth.

 A rocket blasted into space today carrying an unmanned probe on a six-month mission to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> that is designed to help prepare for a manned voyage to the planet. Soviet television broke into its evening news program `` Vremya'' for a live broadcast of the 9:38 p.m. launch from the Baikonur space center in the Soviet Central Asian republic of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>. A 180-foot-tall Proton rocket capped by the probe, Phobos I, erupted in white and gray smoke and orange and blue flames. The newscast switched to the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, which reported the spacecraft's flight was normal. More than a dozen nations are participating in the mission to swoop close to the surface of Mars' moon, Phobos, and drop probes onto the small, potato-shaped moon that scientists say may hold clues to how the universe was formed. A second satellite, <PERSON> Phobos </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, is scheduled to blast off July 12. The satellites will enter Mars' gravity in January and begin a three-month remote study of the surface and atmosphere of Mars. After that, scientists said, they will draw closer to Phobos and drop descent vehicles carrying laser, ionic and radar equipment to help determine the internal structure and composition of the moon. The probes are expected to be sent to <LOCATION> Phobos </LOCATION> in about April of next year, according to <PERSON> Roald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagdeyev </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. Soviet space scientists said <PERSON> Phobos </PERSON> is an important step toward a manned flight to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>, which they hope can take place in the early 21st century. Officials including Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> have proposed that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> take part in the mission. `` First, it is necessary to draw up a more accurate map of the Mars surface in order to choose a place for the future landing,'' said <PERSON> Vyacheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Balebanov </PERSON>, a deputy to <LOCATION> Sagdeyev </LOCATION>. `` Then, it is necessary to study the climate and soil characteristics and find out whether oxygen should be taken from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, or whther it can be gotten directly on the planet. The study of Mars renewed under the Phobos program should provide answers to those questions,'' he said in an interview with the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION>. Also participating in the project are <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said today it was extremely unlikely that a second Iranian airplane was near <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> Air flight 655 when it was shot down by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship Sunday. The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., had said after briefings by <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials that the presence of a second plane would explain why the officers aboard the USS Vincennes mistook the Iranian A300 <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> for an F-14 fighter <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>'s comment raised speculation that an Iranian fighter might have been flying behind the <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION>, hoping to sneak up on the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> told reporters that `` the realm of possibility is fairly small on a phantom aircraft, on a second aircraft.'' An Iranian P-3 <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> patrol plane was far to the north of the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, along the northern shore of <LOCATION> Qeshm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, and two Iranian F-4 fighters took off from <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> after the Airbus was shot down, he said, but they played no role in the incident. Previously, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials had mentioned the P-3 and one of the F-4's, but they had not mentioned the second F-4. The Aegis radar and tracking system aboard the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> is sophisticated enough to have detected any aircraft flying in tandem with the Iranian jetliner, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. The equipment sends out a radar signal that would have been three miles high and wide and one mile deep at the point when the <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> was nine miles away, the point at which the Vicennes fired SM-2 Standard missiles at it and knocked it down. It would have been almost impossible for any other aircraft to have been within that area, he said. The plane was mistaken for an F-14, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said, because the <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> was transmitting an identification signal on a frequency normally reserved for military aircraft. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> also said that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> should share some responsibility for the downing of the plane because it took off from the joint military and civilian airfield at <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> during an exchange of fire between the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> and Iranian gunboats and was headed straight at the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> when it was shot down. `` The Iranians are the ones who bear the resonsibility for ensuring that if they are the ones who provoke the hostilities, they are the ones who began the shooting in this incident, that they ensure the safety of their civilian aircraft by not sending them into harm's way,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> launched an unmanned probe Thursday night on a six-month trip to Mars' moon, Phobos, for a mission designed to pave the way for a manned voyage to the red planet. The 180-foot-tall booster rocket spewed orange and blue flames as it illuminated the nighttime sky at the Baikonur space center in the Soviet Central Asian republic of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>. The launch of the Proton rocket carrying the probe, <PERSON> Phobos </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON>, was carried live on Soviet television, which reported that the spacecraft's flight was proceeding normally. More than a dozen nations are participating in the mission to swoop close to the surface of Phobos and drop probes onto the little, potato-shaped <PERSON> Martian </PERSON> moon that scientists say may hold clues to how the universe was formed. Delegations from around the world gathered at Baikonur for the launch of Phobos I, a joint East-West project to study the moon and Mars itself. A companion probe, <PERSON> Phobos </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, is scheduled for launch on July 12. If all goes well, the two spacecraft will enter the gravitational pull of Mars in January 1989 and fall into orbit just behind Phobos for a three-month remote study of the surface and atmosphere of the planet. In April, the craft will drop out of their orbit and swoop to within 30 yards of the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION>'s surface, where they will release two small landers. The Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that in one experiment, a laser beam will be used to split a tiny piece of Phobos' rocky surface and trap a specimen for close examination. One of the landers is expected to operate for about a year in stationary position, sending back data. Another is designed to leap around the little moon in 20-yard hops gathering soil samples and analyzing them. This is the most sophisticated and ambitious of 18 Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unmanned missions to study Mars. Soviet space scientists have characterized the Phobos mission as an important step toward a manned flight to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>, which they hope will be possible in the early 21st century. The Phobos probes will help map the surface of the planet `` in order to choose a place for the future landing,'' said <PERSON> Vyacheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Balebanov </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` Then, it is necessary to study the climate and soil characteristics and find out whether oxygen should be taken from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, or whether it can be gotten directly on the planet.'' Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has proposed that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> join in the prospective manned mission, but <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials have been cool to the idea, saying it would be very expensive and would require solutions to many difficult problems, one of which is the problem of astronauts' physical deterioration during long periods of weightlessness. Soviet space officials have put the cost of the Phobos mission at $ 480 million. In addition to the Soviets, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> are participating in the flight. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a late entry, will provide tracking data with its Deep Space Network that can determine distances within yards and the velocity of objects billions of miles from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. The Phobos craft also will carry a plaque commemorating the moon's discovery by an American astronomer.

 A radical Shiite Moslem group that holds two American hostages said Thursday their fate will be part of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s revenge for the shooting down of an Iranian airliner in which 290 people were killed. `` Everybody knows that all the strong cards are still in our hand, including the hostages issue, which will be part of a comprehensive response that will make the killers and their partners pay the price,'' said a statement from the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. It was not more specific. Missiles fired by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missile cruiser <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> destroyed the airliner Sunday over the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The typewritten statement in Arabic was delivered to a Western news agency in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> with a photocopy of a page from hostage <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> passport. Revolutionary Justice says it is holding <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> and another <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>. `` We have monitored all the positions denouncing or supporting the American crime,'' the statement said. `` We consider whoever has denounced it a friend to the peoples of the area and whoever has supported it a partner.'' In threats directed at President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, it said: `` We will fight you. We will torture you with our hands. You will not know where, when and how torture and death will face you.'' On Oct. 21, 1986, the group calling itself the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for kidnapping <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, 57, a writer from <LOCATION> Rutland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>, 58, acting comptroller at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION>, was abducted Sept. 12, 1986 He is from Valley Forge, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>.

The photocopy, apparently intended to authenticate Thursday's statement, showed the passport page bearing <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>'s photograph, name and date of birth It said the shooting down of the <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> jetliner `` was not the first time <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> killed children, women and other innocent civilians and will not be the last one.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> stresses that the presence of these -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- fleets and their crimes will certainly reflect on the safety of the American presence all over the world.'' the statement said. Revolutionary Justice, <PERSON> Islamic </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> groups holding hostages are believed to be affiliated with the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. A telephone caller who said he spoke for Islamic Jihad threatened on Tuesday to kill one of the two American captives it holds and dump the body in a west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> neighborhood.

<HEAD>Defiant Arabs Turn in Identity Cards To Protest Tax Raid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN IZENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIT SAHOUR, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hundreds of Palestinians turned in their army-issued identity cards Thursday to protest a pre-dawn raid by Israeli tax collectors. The Palestinian action was an unprecedented gesture of defiance by Arabs toward military authorities in the occupied lands. Non-payment of taxes has become one of the chief civil disobedience tactics used by Palestinians in the uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> that began Dec. 8. In <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahour </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, Israeli tax collectors accompanied by about 300 troops entered the homes of 50 residents at 5 a.m., seized their identity cards, and said they would n't be returned until the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> paid their back taxes. Troops also impounded the cars of some Arabs, apparently for nonpayment of vehicle licensing and other fees. The move prompted about 250 other Arab residents to hand in their identity cards in protest. Palestinians are required to carry identity papers at all times and face immediate arrest if caught without them. The cards also must be presented when requesting permits to travel abroad or other government services. An official of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> military government said there had been no previous incidents of large numbers of Palestinians returning identity cards in protest even though a number of underground leaflets have called for such action. An army official said there was a large gathering outside city hall which dispersed without military intervention. He declined further comment. Dozens of <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahour </LOCATION> residents streamed into town hall to turn over the orange-colored cards, which filled a large drawer. At one point, Palestinians broke into loud cheers and applause when <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousta </PERSON>, the mukhtar or leading town elder, handed over his papers. In their latest leaflet, uprising leaders ordered Palestinians not to pay taxes to `` escalate the uprising and bring us closer to total civil disobedience.'' On Thursday, <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahour </LOCATION> residents were told to report to a girls' high school where departments were set up for collecting back income taxes, value-added taxes and vehicle licensing fees. Few residents turned up to settle their bills. Some said they could not afford to pay what they owed, and others said they refused to pay out of defiance. `` The Israelis are asking the impossible,'' said a Palestinian who would only give his first name, <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON>. `` We ca n't afford it. We live in very difficult conditions.'' <PERSON> Narri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kheir </PERSON>, a carpenter, said the army ordered him to pay $ 2,000 in taxes although he had not worked for three months. A woman, who refused to be identified, said many residents were no longer afraid of Israeli punishments. `` We have nothing to lose any more,'' she said. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, meanwhile, said the first firebomb attack in Jewish west <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> since the uprising began showed that Arabs were intent on destroying <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. There were no casualties in the Wednesday night attack on an Israeli passenger bus in the central commercial district of Jewish west <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. `` The uprising is not about the question of territory ... but about our very existence,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. `` This shows the growing nerve of hostile elements who dare to do such a thing in the center of the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' Mayor <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> described the firebombing as `` a terrible danger for the present and the future.'' Although stone-throwing and firebomb attacks have escalated recently in <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, where 135,000 Arabs live, the attack marked the first time violence has spread to west <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, where about 340,000 Jews live. Also Wednesday, assailants threw a rock from the roof of the largest commercial center in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, damaging the roof of a car. Police spokeswoman <PERSON> Dalia </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilad </PERSON> said police blamed Arabs and rounded up five residents of the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> for questioning. Four were later released. The trial of <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON>, editor of the pro-Palestine <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> daily, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Fajr </PERSON>, began Thursday in a <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON> was charged with violating censorship laws last year for publishing an interview with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> without first submitting it to the military censor. <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON> has advocated an Arab civil disobedience campaign.

 The second car bomb in two days went off Thursday in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s capital, killing one person, <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> radio reported. Six died in the explosion a day earlier. In a late report about a guerrilla rocket attack on the city Wednesday, Western diplomats said a West German free-lance journalist was among the wounded. The diplomats, who spoke on condtiion of anonymity, did not give his name. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> radio said seven people were killed in the rocket attack Wednesday afternoon. The car bomb that killed six people exploded earlier in the day near the building that houses the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Western diplomats and leaders of Moslem guerrillas fighting the Communist government say security around <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> has deteriorated since the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> began pulling its troops out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> under an agreement mediated by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. Diplomats said Thursday they had confirmation of reports that guerrillas captured <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Agha </PERSON>, a district capital 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Labul </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Logar </LOCATION> province. It is astride the <LOCATION> Logar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>, which the sources described as the only remaining secure route south from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> envoy <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>, who negotiated the withdrawal agreement in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, met in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on Thursday with Afghan leader <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, who uses only one name. <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> is due in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> on Friday. The agreement was signed April 14 by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as guarantors. The insurgents, who are supported by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, were left out of the negotiations and have said they will ignore the resulting accord. Afghan guerrillas began fighting after a Communist coup in April 1978, and Soviet military forces entered the country in December 1979. More than 5 million Afghans have fled the country, and at least 3 million live along the border in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. An estimated 115,000 Soviet soldiers were in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> when the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement was signed. They began withdrawing May 15 and all are to be gone by Feb. 15, 1989.

 More hospital waste, including intravenous tubing and vials of blood, washed ashore today on a <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> beach, and officials declared it off-limits for swimmers just a few hours after it was reopened. Swimming bans were lifted today on other beaches along a 25-mile stretch of the island's south shore, facing the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, but officials warned that winds and tides could bring more debris and force more closings. There was no word on where the material came from. Meanwhile in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, officials said Wednesday that five of the 104 blood-filled vials that washed up on its shores last weekend contained AIDS-contaminated blood. Another two dozen vials were found Wednesday. The waves of debris that washed up today at <LOCATION> Robert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moses </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, the easternmost of the affected beaches, were brought in by a combination of high tide and southwesterly winds, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Asheroff </PERSON>, deputy regional director of the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The waste was taken to the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> for testing to determine its source. <PERSON> Asheroff </PERSON> said the popular <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> <PERSON> Beach </PERSON> and the other beaches closed Wednesday and then reopened may see waste washing ashore later this afternoon or by high tide Friday morning. Health inspectors, after finding no new debris on beaches this morning, had decided to reopen them. They also tested the water quality and found it to be safe, <PERSON> Asheroff </PERSON> said. Inspectors from the <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION> health departments and the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> were in patrol boats looking for clues to the origin of the debris. On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Nassau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> recommended that the state, county and town beaches remain closed to swimming until the water was determined safe, said <PERSON> Shelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Domash </PERSON>, a department spokeswoman. `` It's the unknown _ you do n't know what it is or what it's carrying,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, regional director of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parks </LOCATION> `` We wanted to be on the safe side.'' On a typical weekday, 50,000 to 60,000 people visit <LOCATION> Jones </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> state parks, with up to 15 percent swimming, he said. On weekends, as many as 200,000 go to <LOCATION> Jones </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and about 40,000 to <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Moses </PERSON>, which is 10 miles east. A heat wave has just begun, with forecasters predicting temperatures in the 90s through the weekend. <PERSON> Domash </PERSON> said officials were trying to figure out where the debris came from and whether it was related to the debris that washed up in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. The last time the parks' beaches were closed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was 1976 when sewage washed up, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday that five vials discovered last weekend in <LOCATION> Bayonne </LOCATION> showed evidence of the AIDS antibody. It was the second time in a month that vials had washed ashore in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. The presence of the antibody `` does not necessarily indicate that there is live virus in the blood,'' said Deputy Health Commissioner <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>. Early last month, two of five vials found in <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> were contaminated with AIDS. A third tested positive for hepatitis, which is substantially more infectious than AIDS. Police also said Wednesday they have discovered another two dozen vials on the <LOCATION> Bayonne </LOCATION> beach which have been turned over to the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for analysis. <LOCATION> Bayonne </LOCATION> is on a bay that feeds into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>.

 Syrian-backed Palestinian guerrillas overran most of a refugee camp Thursday in an assault aimed at driving loyalists of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> out of their last stronghold in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, police said. At least 14 people died and 36 others were wounded in the five-hour assault on the <PERSON> Bourj </PERSON> el-Barajneh refugee camp, police said. According to police count, 174 people have been killed and 665 wounded since the fighting broke out May 1. A police spokesman, who can not be named under standing regulations, said the dissident <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Uprising </ORGANIZATION> faction backed by a fierce mortar and rocket barrage moved into western and southern sectors of the camp. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s fighters were cornered on the eastern side of the devastated camp. Fighting died down about midday. Reporters who visited the camp saw <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON>'s jubilant guerrillas cleaning debris from the main street. The commander of <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> in the camp, <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON> <PERSON> Abul-Ainen </PERSON>, asked leftist Lebanese militia leaders to `` guarantee the safe evacuation'' of his men, estimated at about 100, police said. The police spokesman said leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Druse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Syrian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> have `` agreed to sponsor the evacuation.'' No timetable has been announced yet, he said. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has been trying for three years to rebuild the power base he lost after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s invaded <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1982. His fighters pushed <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON>'s faction out of <PERSON> Bourj </PERSON> el-Barajneh and a nearby camp, <LOCATION> Chatilla </LOCATION>, in early May. But the dissidents regrouped and began shelling the camps with artillery, rockets and heavy mortars from Syrian-held positions in the mountains surrounding <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The camps already were devastated by attacks from Israelis, Lebanese Christians and Syrian-backed Shiite Moslem militiamen in the last six years. <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Uprising </ORGANIZATION> fighters, led by Col. <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON>, forced <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> loyalists out of <LOCATION> Chatilla </LOCATION> on June 27. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s guerrillas had repulsed at least 21 major attacks since Monday, when fighting flared after a weeklong lull in the power struggle for control of the camps. But <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s fighters lacked the heavy weapons to retaliate for the daily shelling. The police spokesman said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s guerrillas would probably be driven in police buses to the port city of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> has bases. Syrian soldiers would escort the guerrillas to the <LOCATION> Awali </LOCATION> bridge just north of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, he added. The bridge is the Syrian army's southernmost position in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> The camp, which once housed more than 40,000 refugees, was in ruins. Not a single shack has escaped the shellfire. The four-story <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, the camp's only medical center, has been shelled repeatedly. All its doors and windows were blown out. Hospital beds and other equipment were scattered in the street, apparently hurled there by the blast of exploding shells. The hospital was evacuated Tuesday. The few civilians who remained in <LOCATION> Bourj </LOCATION> el-Barajneh were seen packing up what was left of their households and fleeing through the smoking rubble. `` We're proud Palestinians. We do n't want to live with traitors. We will go wherever the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> can take care of us,'' said a woman who identified herself only as <PERSON> Fawziyeh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON> and other radical factions broke away from the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in a 1983 Syrian-backed mutiny and established headquarters in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>. The power struggle between Fatah and <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON>'s guerrillas erupted less than a week after <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> for a reconciliation with President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to end a 5-year-old feud over control of the Palestinian movement. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has claimed that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> was behind the latest fighting to drive <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s forces out of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s men have regrouped in bases in Palestinian camps in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, which is dominated by Shiite Moslems, raising the specter of more violence.

<HEAD>GOP Consultant: Bush's Gender Gap Problem Could Beat Him In
November</HEAD>

 A Republican political consultant said Thursday that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will lose in November if he does n't get the support of more women, and that even a woman running mate would not help substantially. The problem of `` gender gap'' is so serious that overcoming it is probably the most important demographic key to a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> victory, said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, a respected <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> consultant. `` If he does n't bridge the gender gap he will not win ... There are not enough white men available for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to win this election,'' <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> predicted that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the likely <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee, will win, however, by making changes in his campaign strategy to make him more appealing to women voters. He said the campaign's emphasis on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s past government and military experience does not appeal to women, whose primary concerns tend to be economic issues affecting work and family. `` There's nothing wrong with playing baseball at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>, and there surely is nothing wrong with serving your country and being a genuine war hero and there's nothing wrong with being director of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said. `` But frankly, that is a biography that links up dramatically with male instincts, and male interests and male priorities. It says nothing positive about linking up that agenda of issues ... of highest priority to women voters,'' he said. He recommended that the vice president concentrate on making his own family more visible at campaign appearances, and make a more forceful commitment to issues like long-term health care, job security and education. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> spoke at a news conference called by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> and Professional Women's Clubs, which released an analysis on the gender gap, a term used to describe differences in men and women's political preferences and behavior. The study looked at recent polls which have shown that women are more pessimistic than men about the economy and thus more likely to vote against the current administration, as represented by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Polls show male voters generally split between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and likely Democratic nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, while women voters are more likely to lean toward <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` The perception is that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is respectful of women and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is not,'' she said. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> acknowledged that the `` gender gap numbers over the first six months of this year have been disaster for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' Asked about the impact of the selection of a women vice presidential candidate on the Republican ticket, <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said that it could be negative if it is perceived as a symbolic act done because of the polls. `` Frankly, I do not think that the selection of a woman for vice president would do more than a marginal job,'' <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, a political science professor at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who prepared the analysis, noted that polls in recent weeks have shown more women undecided and that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' support among women had eroded somewhat. Much of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' support comes from anti-Bush sentiment, and substantial numbers of both men and women are `` not sure at this time that either of these men are suited to be president,'' she said. In any case, women's votes will be crucial in November `` if this presidential election is as close as many analysts are predicting,'' she said.

<HEAD>Many Goals For Infant, Maternal Health Not Being Met</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For release 6:30 p.m. EDT</NOTE>

 Most of the nation's top goals for babies and pregnant women _ including a hoped-for reduction in the infant mortality rate _ will not be met by the 1990 target date, federal health officials said Thursday. `` It's certainly sobering and concerning,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Koontz </PERSON>, a specialist with the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, Md. `` This indicates that we have some significant problems relating to maternal and infant health.'' The government in 1979 published its 1990 health objectives for the nation, including 13 top-priority goals relating to pregnancy and infant health. Only three of those 13 goals are likely to be met, the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday in its weekly report. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>, using <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> data, projects that the nation's infant mortality rate _ infants dying before age 1 _ will be 9.1 per 1,000 live births. That's a drop from the 10.6 rate in 1985, but still short of the 9.0 rate in the 1990 objectives. Based on data from 1970-81, health officials had projected a 1990 infant mortality rate of 7.8, but `` the decline in the infant mortality rate has slowed,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. The reasons are not known, Ms. <PERSON> Koontz </PERSON> said. `` It's a very complex field,'' she said. `` We'd all like to see improvements, but there's not been a simple solution.'' Another objective says that no racial or ethnic group should have an infant mortality rate worse than 12 per 1,000. Among black Americans, the rate stood at 18.2 in 1985 and is projected to decline only to 15.9 by 1990, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. The infant mortality rate among whites stood at 9.3 per 1,000 in 1985 and is projected to fall to 7.9 by 1990, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> noted. Although economics may play a part in the discrepancy between blacks' and whites' infant mortality rates _ `` We know that poor economic circumstances are distributed disproportionately among minority populations,'' Ms. <PERSON> Koontz </PERSON> said _ the complete reason is not clear, she added. Previous studies have shown that among college-educated mothers, black infants still have nearly twice the mortality rate of comparable white infants, she noted. `` A lot of attention is being given to try to discern what's accounting for the differences,'' she said `` Those answers are n't readily available. One of the goals that is likely to be met concerns the nation's neonatal mortality rate _ babies dying in the first 28 days of life That rate is projected to be 5.7 per 1,000 in 1990, below the target of 6.5. The other two objectives likely to be met are having most babies leave the hospital in car safety seats _ a 1987 survey put the figure at 75 percent _ and putting into place programs to screen newborns for metabolic disorders, which all states now have, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. Among the other goals not likely to be met: _ Reducing the perinatal death rate _ deaths between 28 weeks' gestation and the first seven days after birth _ to less than 5.5 per 1,000 The 1990 projection: 8.5. _ No county, racial or ethnic group should have a maternal death rate above five per 100,000 live births. The 1990 national rate is projected at 7.0, with black mothers at 20.5. _ No more than 5 percent of babies should be born under 2,500 grams, or 5.5 pounds. The 1990 projection: 6.7 percent. _ No county, racial or ethnic group should have a low-birth-weight rate over 9 percent. For blacks, the 1990 projection is 12.3 percent. _ No more than 10 percent of pregnant women in any county, racial or ethnic group should go without prenatal care in the first three months of pregnancy. The 1990 national projection: 23.6 percent, 38.5 percent for blacks. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said insufficient information is available to ascertain the progress toward the other three priority goals: making 85 percent of the nation's childbearing-age women aware of the hazards of smoking, drinking and drugs; serving all women and infants in a regionalized system of perinatal care; and having comprehensive primary health care available to all infants.

 A sophisticated test that allows detection of minute amounts of the AIDS virus in people who by conventional tests appear uninfected is being offered commercially by two <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> laboratories. The test uses a technique called polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, in which extremely small amounts of genetic material can be picked out and quickly copied to provide enough material for analysis. It has been used in rare cases to identify people carrying small amounts of the AIDS virus but who tested negative on conventional tests. The PCR test does not detect only AIDS, but any tiny amounts of genetic material. It has previously been available only for research. <ORGANIZATION> Cetus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which developed the technique, on Wednesday announced it has licensed the <ORGANIZATION> Pathology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Specialty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> to use the test. Physicians or laboratories will be able to send them blood samples for testing, which takes five days and costs about $ 145. The PCR technique is not intended to replace the standard ELISA test, which detects antibodies to the acquired immune deficiency syndrom virus. In many cases, the AIDS virus does not trigger production of antibodies for six months or more after the infection has occurred.

<TEXT>
 As <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> looks over his list of potential running mates _ seven names by all indications _ no one of them stands out as an unencumbered choice. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor is expected to announce his choice next week, before the opening of the Democratic National Convention where he will be named the party's presidential nominee. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was on a Western campaign swing on Thursday, scheduled to return to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> on Sunday. Aides said he was taking Monday off, but the expectation was he would use that time to go over the material gathered by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>, the close friend and lawyer who has been heading the veep search. The following names are understood to be on the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> list: <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, Sens. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, and Reps. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. Three other names were on the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> list _ Sens. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. All three said no thanks. It's always possible that the buttoned-down <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> could surprise everyone and choose someone whose name has made no lists. But the known universe is the above-named seven. Each has been asked for detailed personal and financial information and each has met privately with the governor. While strong cases can be made for each, it often is the negatives that play a key role in determining the choice. In other words, it often is as much a process of elimination as of selection. Here's a look at the downside of the seven: _ <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Despite a campaign in which he was widely praised for moving into the mainstream of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and addressing issues of primary concern to white as well as non-white voters, every national survey has said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would hurt the Democratic ticket far more than he would help it. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a highly disciplined individual and would expect his running mate to be equally controlled, an expectation that would be impossible with the volatile <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. _ <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>. The former astronaut and <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> pilot is a genuine national hero who would give the ticket an image of strength on defense. Polls indicate <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> helps the ticket in nearly every section of the country. But <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> has always done better in the polls than at the ballot box. He ran a disastrous campaign for president in 1984 and still owes more than $ 2 million. Another rap against him was best expressed by <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in 1976. After meeting <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> reportedly told aides, `` He's the most boring man I've ever met.'' _ <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. No Democrat has been elected president this century without carrying <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s home state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which has the third largest number of electoral votes _ 29. But <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> also is <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s home state and there is no guarantee <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> would carry the state for the Democratic ticket. In addition, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is up for re-election. The old <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> law remains in effect _ legislation passed in 1960 to permit <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> to run for re-election to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> while he also was running for vice president. But times have changed and an effort to go for a double could cost <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat. _ <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> would probably give the Democratic ticket <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s 21 electoral votes. But he's little known outside his home state and is only in his second year in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. If <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is looking for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> experience to balance the ticket, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> seems an unlikely choice. _ <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. `` Damaged goods'' is the phrase some <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> advisers use to describe the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator, a reference to his failed presidential campaign. A major argument <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> used during his campaign earlier this year was that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> represented the Mondale-McGovern wing of the party. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> share the distinction of having lost 49 states as Democratic presidential nominees. It was a comparison that did n't sit well with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. Another failed challenger for the presidential nomination, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> ran well in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and creditably in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, but then bombed out. His Japan-bashing rhetoric on trade was sharply different from the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> approach. He also was seen as too willing to play special interest politics. _ <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>. `` Well respected'' is the term often used to describe this senior member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` Boring'' is another. Virtually unknown outside his district, <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> could n't even guarantee <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> <PERSON> Indiana </PERSON>'s 12 electoral votes.

 An 88-year-old woman who sat on her porch for a month, waiting to die, has been taken by her stepchildren for a bath and a checkup. <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON>, who can not walk, was spending Thursday at a neighbor's home. `` Older people are going to be defiant but from what I've seen here, she's not fine,'' said a stepdaughter, <PERSON> Roxie </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` She did have some objections but we decided to go on in and take her away from the house.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said she and two other stepchildren have tried for years to get Mrs. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> to live with them. `` We've been very concerned about her, but she would n't let us do anything, would n't let us take her back We were here last year to clean up the house or either to buy a mobile home to put on the lot, but she was determined that we would n't do that.'' Then, Mrs. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> could walk and seemed able to care for herself, Mrs. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. `` What I've seen here is a totally different individual.'' The stepchildren, all of whom live in other states, were contacted by neighbors concerned about Mrs. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON>'s physical condition, rundown house and cluttered yard. While Mrs. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> sat on the rotted porch, neighbors took her food each day and tried to persuade her to leave. She now has seen a doctor and taken a bath, but no decision has been made on where she will go when her stepchildren leave. `` I feel so much better. I can sleep now,'' said the Rev. A.L. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Montevallo </LOCATION>, who tried to get help for her. He said that since she did not want to leave her home, he could do little besides checking on her condition.

<TEXT>
 Federal health officials reported Thursday the nation's first case of human anthrax since 1984 _ in a textile worker believed infected by contaminated cashmere. A 42-year-old maintenance man at a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> mill became ill last July with a small red lesion on his arm, and developed pain, fever and chills over the following week, the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> reported. He was diagnosed with a cutaneous form of anthrax, a severe and potentially fatal disease most common in cattle and sheep. Only nine human cases have occurred in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the last decade, none since 1984, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. The patient, who recovered, had n't recently been out of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> or been exposed to animals or animal materials. However, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> noted, his mill uses wool imported from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, cashmere goat hair from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and camel hair from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>. Eight of 59 textile samples tested at the mill _ including five samples of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> cashmere _ showed contamination with anthrax bacteria, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said in its weekly report. `` The West Asian cashmere was probably the contaminant,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` Western <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> is an endemic area for anthrax.'' The other three contaminated samples were either debris or Australian wool which may have been cross-contaminated while stored near the cashmere, the Atlanta-based agency said. `` This case demonstrates that the potential for occupational transmission of -LRB- anthrax -RRB- ... still exists,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. Vaccination programs were recommended for workers at the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> plant and at a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> plant where the cashmere was washed, said the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>, which, as is its custom, did not identify the locations involved.

The monumental visages of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, can be seen for 60 miles. <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rushmore </LOCATION> is the No. 1 tourist attraction in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, with more than 2 million visitors a year.

 A shower a day helps keep the drought at bay, and a little soap in hand does n't hurt. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON> has rigged up a portable shower on his front lawn. Several mornings a week, he trots outside in his swimsuit, connects the garden hose and lathers up with biodegradable soap. `` I feel sorry for my lawn,'' said <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON>, 41, a corporate lawyer. `` I think my lawn needs the water more than the city sewer system does.'' <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> has no restrictions on outside water use, but <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON> is doing his bit for conservation with his shower. `` I've been using it for a shower and lawn-waterer intermittently for about three weeks now,'' he said. <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON> moves the shower to a different spot each day but the dousings are n't enough to water his entire lawn. He limits the watering to specific flowers and trees. `` Any other water the lawn gets is from whatever spray or overflow it happens to get from what little plant watering we do,'' he said.

 The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration on Thursday offered $ 5 million for land designated for a prison, but the owners demanded nearly twice as much money and vowed a court fight if the state acquires the property by eminent domain. `` This bid is simply too low for us to seriously consider,'' co-owner <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Striar </PERSON> said after a brief meeting with state officials. `` We feel confident that the property has a market value of over $ 9 million.'' The controversy over the planned medium-security prison on 782 acres in rural <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Braintree </LOCATION> has become a political embarrassment for all-but-certain <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is conducting a preliminary inquiry into allegations by prison opponents that <PERSON> Striar </PERSON> and co-owner <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> bought the land after receiving a tip about the state's interest. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and the owners have dismissed the charges. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor also has continued to back the proposal for the 500-bed prison. `` If negotiations are not successful, we will move to take the property by eminent domain,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Striar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> stood by the $ 9.6 million price they asked for when they first offered the land to the state in 1986, less than a year after they bought it for $ 3 million. On the property is a building that once served as a religious academy, 20 homes and more than 700 acres of farmland. A preliminary state appraisal estimated the land's value at $ 8.7 million. Opponents of the prison, led by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Braintree </LOCATION> selectwoman <PERSON> Dorothea </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas-Vitrac </PERSON>, cited those figures to support claims that the state sought out the developers as middlemen in the land deal and would reward them with a whopping profit. Three subsequent, more detailed appraisals that were commissioned by the state, placed the value of the land at about $ 5 million. Two appraisals put its worth at exactly $ 5 million; the third at $ 4.98 million. The state's offering price was based on those appraisals, which took into account an environmental impact study that said the state would have to build a sewage treatment plant on the land if it located a prison there. If negotiations for the property do not resume and the state seeks to claim the land through eminent domain, the owners can contest the state's offering price in court. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Striar </PERSON>, said the owners would take legal action.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, seeking to limit public disagreements, directed their chiefs of staff Thursday to coordinate campaign policy pronouncements and strategy. `` I think everyone agrees that the main issue is, ` No surprises,''' presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said in describing a luncheon that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and aides had in the White house residence. `` Keeping them informed of our policy moves and vice versa would be a key element,'' he said. `` We did n't talk about specific issues.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s policy decisions would not be driven by consideration of how they would affect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s prospects. `` The president makes his decisions on the merits, on what he thinks is best for the country,'' he said. `` On the other hand, it's also important to know what the vice president's positions are, how the campaign is framing certain actions and so forth.'' At the luncheon, he said, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> reiterated that he expects <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to `` present his own approach to the problems'' of the 1990s. And he said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> acknowledged `` their previously reached understanding that the vice president will want to take positions during the campaign that may differ from the president and administration policy.'' But the spokesman also said that beginning Monday, a coordinating team headed by <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chief of staff <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chief of staff <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> will meet at least once weekly. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> has been sitting in on White House staff meetings.

He said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> may take part in some campaign activities for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> during the president's summer vacation in August. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at a news conference in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> that joint Reagan-Bush appearances were not discussed at the meeting, `` but I would think there would be some.''

 Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> met with six farm-state governors Thursday and emerged saying the need for legislative action to provide drought relief has now become urgent. `` There's a need to do something, it would probably take legislation to do that and there's a need to do it with some urgency,'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> told a news conference following the session with governors and key lawmakers. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>'s call for swift action was in marked contrast to past remarks that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should hold off on fashioning a drought relief package until it is certain of the extent of the damage wrought by sizzling temperatures and a shortage of rainfall in the Farm Belt. Since he made those remarks several weeks ago, however, the drought has become more ominous. Spring wheat, oats and barley already are hard hit in the Grain Belt and authorities forecast drastic reductions in corn yields unless there is substantial rain in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> within a week. `` It's a critical time when the corn is tasseling and we're in the pollinating stage,'' said <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> said after the meeting. `` Every day that goes by we see a substantial reduction in yields.'' Participants in the meeting at offices of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said they reached broad agreement on almost all fronts. They said farmers need more assurance that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will act this year and that therefore bill drafting should begin quickly. `` The decision to act I think is uniform among the people who were present,'' said <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinner </PERSON>, chairman of the association's committee on agriculture and rural development. `` There also was a uniform decision that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> probably should address this.'' Bill-drafting sessions could start as early as next week in both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Agriculture committees, said the chairmen of those panels, Rep. E. `` Kika'' de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt. Also on hand were Govs <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mickelson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. Seven other states were represented at the session by their lieutenant governors. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said there were good prospects that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would sign relief legislation if it is a measure `` that is reasonable and compassionate and will help farmers.'' Officials said a consensus was forming around a few key proposals that could well be included in relief legislation. They said the measure most likely would allow farmers to keep all of the so-called deficiency payments that they have received in advance. Deficiency payments are income-support subsidies. They represent the difference between the market price of the crop and a target price set by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and adjusted by the secretary of agriculture. As the drought has intensified, crop prices have been rising in anticipation of scarcity later. Thus the gap between market prices and target prices has shrunk, leaving farmers with smaller payments at the same time that their crops have been wiped out. Forty percent of the deficiency payments, however, already were parceled out in advance to producers. `` I think it would be very difficult to collect advance deficiency payments from farmers who have no income,'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> told reporters. The officials also said that producers of `` non-program'' crops should also receive relief under the legislation. Soybeans constitute the largest of these crops, whose producers do not receive deficiency payments. Various other fruits and vegetables also are non-program crops. The officials were less clear on exactly how much the measure would cost. De la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> and others emphasized that the cost of the drought bill would not be able to push the cost of farm subsidies over their budgeted $ 17 billion limit. Lawmakers are expecting to save a considerable sum as a result of the smaller size of deficiency payments to many farmers. This amount in turn could be recycled and paid out in the form of drought relief, but that still would not take in aid to growers of non-program crops. `` That was discussed in there,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stenholm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. He said it was unsure where the money would come from. Governors made clear, however, that some form of relief was needed. `` Farmers in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> would face a a real economic disaster from which they would not recover if we failed to get relief,'' said <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON>. `` We will get relief.''

 Standing in front of a run-down motel where the government pays for the lodging of homeless families, three <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers on Thursday called for a $ 15 billion-a-year program to create new low-income housing. `` We have a responsibility,'' Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., told reporters and homeless activists at the <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inn </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> motel where the government provides room and board for the homeless at an estimated cost of $ 3,000 a month per family Under <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s bill, about $ 75 billion would be spent over five years for construction of new housing, renovation of existing buildings, upgrading of public housing and the acquisition of additional units. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, joined by Reps. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Flake </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said the legislation is not aimed at this year, but for 1989 and the new administration. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said he has not discussed the proposal with <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democrat's expected presidential nominee. The lawmakers criticized the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's cuts in housing programs and the increasing government reliance on vouchers, designed to be used by the poor to go towards paying for rents in privately owned apartments. They said the vouchers do not work in cities such as <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> where there are few available low-cost housing units. The legislative program would be self-financing through a doubling of the cigarette tax, limiting deductions for business meals and entertainment expenses and other tax adjustments, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said. `` We can not afford not to build more affordable housing,'' said <PERSON> Flake </PERSON>. `` Homeless are human beings and they have rights too.'' The legislation was embraced by homeless activists. `` This bill can eliminate this place,'' said <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, pointing to the motel where he said families with four and five children live in a single room. Windows in the rooms do not open, forcing residents to leave doors open at night and making them more vulnerable to crime, <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said. Organizers from the Community for Creative Non-Violence said parents or older children must stay awake through the night to protect infants from rats. Officials at the motel, apparently upset by the publicity, instructed security guards to prevent <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> and the congressmen from touring the complex with reporters and TV camera crews in tow. `` Tell him to have me arrested,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> snapped at the guard. The tour continued without incident. The group did not go inside any rooms, but walked through a darkened corridor littered with food and other trash to the back where <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> described living conditions. Motel manager <PERSON> Fadru </PERSON> <PERSON> Haji </PERSON> declined comment. `` Let them say what they want to say,'' he said. `` It's a one-sided story.'' Meanwhile, homeless organizers announced plans for demonstrations in more than 60 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities and towns next Thursday to protest the plight of the homeless. Activists plan to occupy abandoned government-owned buildings as an act of civil disobedience to focus attention on structures that go unused while some poor have no place to live. The Community for Creative Non-Violence said activists also plan 24-hour vigils, rallies and marches.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, grappling with one of its most sensitive political issues, sidestepped a decision Thursday on whether to let the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> shut down unneeded military bases. The chamber was considering a pair of plans setting up complex mechanisms and procedures for closing some of the 3,800 military installations around the nation. Pentagon officials estimate that between $ 2 billion and $ 5 billion annually could be saved by shutting unneeded bases. But after a preliminary test vote, the chamber dropped the bill, in part because the debate had run longer than scheduled. House members generally do not work past Thursday afternoons, permitting members from Western states to return home for election-year campaigning. For the past 11 years, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has blocked any base closings because closings mean lost jobs, and lawmakers have been loath to see payrolls cut. But the federal budget deficit has forced Congess to take another look at the closings. And Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ala </LOCATION>., noted that this is also a politically opportune time to act `` Many things have come together to make this possible,'' <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said. `` We have a window of opportunity. We have a lame-duck <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, we have a lame-duck administration, a lame-duck secretary of defense.'' <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> has appointed a nine-member commission to review the nation's military facilities and decide by the end of the year which can be closed. That commission has been meeting for the past two months. Under the two plans considered Thursday, the commission would send its report to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> next Dec. 31, who would then have until shortly before he leaves office next Jan. 20 to either accept or reject the entire list. The president could not pick or choose from among the bases. Then, under a plan proposed by Rep. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Armey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, the bases would be closed starting Jan. 1, 1990, unless both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted against the list. But under the second plan, the closings could not go forward unless both chambers voted in favor of the plan. The second plan was backed by three committees, which jointly agreed to overhaul the original <PERSON> Armey </PERSON> plan. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, in what <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., called a key test of views on the issue, voted 250-138 in support of an amendment providing that the base closures would go ahead unless both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote to block them That provision, by Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasich </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, is similar to the plan proposed by <PERSON> Armey </PERSON>. The amendment was added to the committee-backed bill. Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of one of the three panels, the <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should have to vote to approve any closings. The <PERSON> Armey </PERSON> plan `` is designed to circumvent the political process,'' <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> told his colleagues. But Rep. <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Morella </PERSON>, R-Md., said the <PERSON> Armey </PERSON> proposal `` is the only way we can get this done. In addition to requiring an affirmative, rather than a negative vote, the committee-backed plan would also require the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to come up with plans to restore the environment at each outdated base, along with new studies about the economic impact of the closings. Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, noted that <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budgets `` are declining The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ought to take every opportunity we can to make sure the money we spend on defense is spent wisely.'' In the decades after World War II, when the nation was winding down from a large-scale military structure, the Pentagon was generally allowed to do what it wanted on the issue with the exception of a handful of bases protected by key, powerful members. Between 1961 and 1977, the Pentagon closed 3,600 installations. But in 1975, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> proposed shutting down <ORGANIZATION> Loring </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in northern <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. That state's legislators blocked the procedure by requiring lengthy _ and costly _ environmental impact studies for the <PERSON> Loring </PERSON> closing and all future closings. Since 1977, no major facilities have been shut. <PERSON> Armey </PERSON>'s proposal was defeated last year, 199-192, but he decided to try again because circumstances were different. House approval would send the plan to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which voted for its own base-closing plan two months ago. That proposal, creating a 15-member commission, was attached to a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget bill, but was later dropped by the <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee called to resolve differences between the two chambers over the defense budget.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, hoping to steal thunder from <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, is likely to break with tradition and go on the road stumping for votes and media attention during the Democratic National Convention. The plan, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, is to `` get a little bit of ink'' while the spotlight is on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his nomination as the Democrats' presidential candidate Traditionally, presidential candidates keep a low profile during the nominating conventions of their rivals. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, still playing by those rules although he is not running this year, will be at his mountaintop ranch in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> when the Democrats meet in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> July 18-21. On another campaign matter, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, seeking to limit public disagreements, directed their chiefs of staff Thursday to coordinate campaign policy pronouncements. `` I think everyone agrees that the main issue is, ` No surprises,''' presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and aides met over lunch at the White House. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said recently he was debating whether to travel during the Democratic convention. `` I think probably some but _ you know, I do n't know, I do n't know what's the right thing to do.'' On the one hand, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, he'd get news coverage by being on the road. On the other hand, he said, `` you do n't want to look like you're trying to frantically elbow your way into the news cycle. Tentatively, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s planners are looking at events on Monday and Tuesday and Friday and Saturday of Democratic convention week _ the opening two days of the convention and the two days after it ends. Republicans already are planning to send a team of surrogates to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to make sure the media hears their point of view. <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, the vice president's press secretary, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s schedulers were looking `` mainly at fund-raisers, nuts and bolts work that's got to get done, and it's a good time to do it. She said that Wednesday and Thursday `` are the big, big days -LRB- for the Democrats -RRB- and you keep them open.'' Wednesday night at the convention is reserved for the presidential nomination and presidential roll call, while Thursday night is set aside for the vice presidential nomination, roll call and acceptance speeches. At this point, most polls show the Dukakis-Bush race fairly close. Some surveys show <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ahead by about four points, while others indicate it is even. With all the attention on the Democratic convention, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is expected to move ahead of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and come away from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> with a hefty lead over the vice president, perhaps as much as 10 to 15 points, according to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirthlin </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s pollster. `` The Republicans need some kind of major event, giving <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the focus, the play, the visibility'' after <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wirthlin </PERSON> said. He said an obvious thing for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to do would be to name his vice presidential nominee right after the Democratic convention, robbing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of the opportunity to bask alone in the limelight. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he has not begun to focus on his running mate yet. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, talking with reporters on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> II Wednesday night as he returned from <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, said he would not be idle after he claims the Republican nomination at the party's convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> Aug. 15-18. He said he is thinking about having meetings in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> on campaign strategy and with surrogates. He acknowledged that the general election phase of the campaign will begin ahead of the traditional Labor Day opening and talked about the demands that will pose. `` The physical thing _ I do n't want to get too tired. I'd like to get some time -LRB- off -RRB- before this last rush to judgment. But I know physically I can do this.'' He said he was still jogging, `` getting tired but I still feel up to it. `` So physically, I'm not too worried about it. I do n't want to get tired and make a lot of mistakes,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added. `` And if you do -LRB- get tired -RRB-, as I've found out, you can make mistakes.'' Referring to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who is 54, the 64-year-old vice president said, `` He will not outwork me. Might do other things more, better, but he's not going to outwork me. He will not be in better shape than I am to do the physical part of this thing.''

<HEAD>Feds Hand Counties New Authority On Drought Aid</HEAD>

 Drought-stricken counties no longer will have to get <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s approval before approving emergency feed programs for livestock producers, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hertz </PERSON>, administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> ASCS </ORGANIZATION>, said each county committee will have the authority to make the declaration based on a determination of substantial feed loss in the county. Previously, the procedure required the agency's county committees to submit requests for emergency feed help to the state office for review. If approved, the state committee would then forward the request to <ORGANIZATION> ASCS </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. The aid involves the Emergency Feed Program and the Emergency Feed Assistance Program. Under the Emergency Feed Program, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> pays eligible livestock owners a portion of the cost of feed bought to replace that which is normally produced on the farm. The Emergency Feed Assistance Program allows the sale of USDA-owned grain at reduced prices _ 75 percent of the basic county price support loan rate. Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> told reporters of the change in program approval earlier in the day after meeting at <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>. `` The -LRB- drought -RRB- counties will not have to make application to get approval here in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the emergency feed and emergency feed assistance program,'' <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> said. `` They can just notify <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> that they will be providing that -LRB- assistance -RRB- on an individual farmer-by farmer basis.'' <PERSON> Branstand </PERSON> said that to qualify, a farmer will have to show the county office of the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> that he has endured at least a 40 percent loss in normal feed stocks. `` This is going to avoid a lot of confusion and a lot of questions in the country, that are hurting the livestock producers,'' he said. `` And I think it is a very positive development.'' As of July 6, the feed programs were approved by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> for 474 counties in 22 states. Overall, 1,844 counties in 37 states are on the department's drought list. The emergency feed programs will now be available in all the remaining designated counties at the discretion of county committees. -

 Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said Thursday he wants to be reimbursed for his legal fees from the independent counsel's investigation and acknowledged that he would have handled the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> matter differently if he had known `` that this was a gang of crooks.'' `` Obviously, ... if you had total knowledge of what was going to be revealed later ... then there might be things you do differently,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said in an interview with reporters. `` For example, in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> matter, which was handled like I would any other ..., if I had known or anybody had known ... that this was a gang of crooks, there would have been quite different handling of the situation, obviously. But nobody did know that,'' said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, who announced Tuesday he will leave government in late July or early August. His reference to `` crooks'' apparently was directed at four former <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> executives who pleaded guilty to criminal charges and are cooperating in the government's prosecution of Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and other politicians and businessmen in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal. On the matter of his legal fees, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> confirmed that he would seek reimbursement from the taxpayers for his expenses in defending himself during the investigation by independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>. The independent counsel submitted his report on the investigation on Tuesday. Although the contents of the report have not been not been made public, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has said he was vindicated because <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> did not seek an indictment. On his 1987 financial disclosure form issued this week, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> estimated his legal fees for the first 7 -LCB- months of the investigation at $ 100,000 to $ 250,000. The Ethics in Government Act, under which the investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was conducted, provides for reimbursement of fees incurred by public officials who are n't indicted. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> will apply for payment of the fees to the three-member federal appeals court panel that appointed McKay. Also during the interview with reporters, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> insisted that he has lived up to the promise he made 3 -LCB- years ago to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that he would avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest or even a situation in which someone might unfairly interpret something as a conflict of interest. `` I've adhered to that standard throughout,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said. He added that `` obviously there have been things that ... I did n't know about'' at the time, but said that based on `` everything I knew at the time, I've upheld that standard throughout the time that I've been in office.'' As White House counselor in 1981, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, at the behest of longtime friend <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, interceded on behalf of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, defense contractor. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has acknowledged directing his staff to ensure that the firm got a fair hearing from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in the company's effort to win a $ 32 million no-bid engine-building contract. <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> ended up getting the job and <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s involvement with the company has been a major focus of the just-completed 14-month criminal investigation of his activities. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said in the interview that `` I did handle many other similar matters in the White House when there were complaints made or concerns expressed about the treatment being afforded by government departments.'' While <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> wo n't be indicted, he could face an examination of his ethics by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsibility </ORGANIZATION> or the Office of Government Ethics. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> is under indictment for alleged racketeering in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal, and his close relationship with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> formed the basis for <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s criminal investigation of the attorney general. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said earlier this year that he still regarded <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> as his friend, but subsequently has declined to answer any questions in regard to <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, who has yet to come to trial on the indictment.

 The funeral of the ousted <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> president's mother in that Central American nation could bring the former leader out of hiding, a consular official said Thursday <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, recognized by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s leader, has not been seen in public since Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> replaced him in February with the current acting civilian chief of state, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>. The body of <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Abigail </PERSON> <PERSON> Henriquez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, 71, was to be flown to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Thursday evening. She died at Mercy Hospital here Wednesday of a heart attack, a week after flying to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> for heart surgery, said <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Dominguez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s consul here Her funeral was set Friday, and <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> has said <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> and his family can attend the service without fear of reprisal, said <PERSON> Dominguez </PERSON>. `` I understand from family members that <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> may attend the funeral, but I have not spoken to him directly,'' he said. `` But it could be a trap,'' added <PERSON> Dominguez </PERSON>, who opposes <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the country's military leader. The funeral could be a problem for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which must decide whether it should protect <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, he said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s anti-Noriega ambassador, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, said Thursday the funeral will be private. He did not not know if <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> planned to come out of hiding for the service. He said he has not received `` communications from the illegitimate government'' of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> about arrangements for <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s safety. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Justesen </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said his office had no information on whether <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> or anyone from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy there would attend. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> refused comment on whether its officials would attend the funeral, and said they did not know <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s plans. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was replaced by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> after he tried to fire him as head of the armed forces in the wake of the general's indictment in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug charges. The ouster was never recognized by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government, which cut off funds to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in an unsuccessful effort to remove <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration later offered to drop the indictments in return for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s departure, but the deal fell through.

<HEAD>First Death of Demonstrator Reported in Ethnic Turmoil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL PUTZEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The first death of a demonstrator in a monthslong ethnic dispute was reported Thursday in the southern republic of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, whose residents continued a strike that has devastated the area's economy. The government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said a resident of the Armenian capital of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kh </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zakharyan </PERSON>, was seriously wounded on a highway Tuesday and died later in a hospital. It said a criminal investiation had begun. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> reported that a `` major part'' of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s industry, construction and transportation remained idle Thursday. The Armenian press agency said <PERSON> Zakharyan </PERSON> was hit by a plastic bullet fired by Soviet forces shortly after thousands of demonstrators mobbed <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>'s international airport on Tuesday to demand that aviation workers join the strike. Government spokesmen in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> denied on Wednesday that anyone had died in the latest round of protests by Armenians seeking annexation of the nearby region of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, now part of the neighboring republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. The report Thursday was the first of Soviet forces using guns against demonstrators since the peaceful protests in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> began in February. It was also the first indication that troops patrolling the area are armed with rounds designed to be non-lethal. An editor at <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s official news agency said troops were called to <LOCATION> Zvartnots </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to break up the demonstration, which disrupted flights. The soldiers were withdrawn Thursday and flights resumed, said the editor, speaking on condition of anomymity. A Soviet television newscast Thursday night showed crowds of people who had been waiting for days at the airport for flights out of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. `` What I saw is practically impossible to describe in words,'' a witness of Tuesday's airport demonstration said in a broadcast interview. `` In my opinion, innocent passengers suffered.'' The TV report showed soldiers wearing helmets and carrying guns patrolling roads leading to the airport. It was not clear when the pictures were taken. The labor newspaper Trud said Thursday that the airport disturbance forced cancellation of 60 flights Monday and Tuesday and disrupted the travel of 14,000 passengers. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Perfilyev </PERSON> told a news conference Wednesday that troops routed about 2,000 people from the immediate airport area. He said 36 people `` had to seek medical assistance'' after the clash late Tuesday. <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrosyan </PERSON>, a member of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s Politburo, went on television Wednesday evening to call on Armenians to resume work and `` be reasonable,'' Trud said. It quoted the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> as saying the situation in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> remains serious. Ethnic Armenians make up the majority in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. They have long been demanding that the mountainous region be transfered to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> supports the demand, but <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> rejects it and the issue has gone to officials in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. In February, rioting in the Azerbaijani city of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> left dead 32 people _ 26 Armenians and six Azerbaijanis. Newspapers reported Tuesday that a general strike had begun in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, apparently over dissatisfaction with a national <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that failed to resolve the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> dispute.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> delegates concluded their annual meeting Thursday by adopting a watered-down resolution extending condolences to the families of the 290 victims of the downed Iranian jet. After a long debate, the 8,227 delegates voted to delete language that would have implicitly criticized the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The final wording approved by the teacher delegates extended `` our sincere condolences to the families of victims. The Representative Assembly urges all parties to seek an immediate solution to the conflict.'' The 1.9 million-member union has been a frequent critic of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration foreign policies. In other actions, delegates approved a resolution that would restrict home schooling and force anyone teaching a child at home to meet state requirements. They also urged public schools to teach children about the influence of religious heritage in the nation and the world. The union also passed a measure urging athletic organizations, sports media outlets and others `` to join in efforts to change the term, ` man-to-man' defense'' to `` one-to-one'' defense in reference to women's and girls' basketball. Finally, the teacher union called on its members to refrain from participating in mass released balloon launches, especially those made of latex, because they have `` a deleterious impact on our environment.'' A national balloon launch sponsored each spring by a science teachers' organization has come under criticism from environmentalists, who say porpoises and other marine life have been harmed by ingesting the ballooms. The science teachers are looking for safer balloons.

<TEXT>
 Advice columnist <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Landers </PERSON> says she broke her rule against helping readers contact each other to help a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran get in touch with the mother of a buddy killed in the war. After trying unsuccessfully to locate the man's family, Ms. <PERSON> Landers </PERSON> decided to publish a letter from veteran <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Noble </PERSON>, who wrote that he wanted <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dugan </PERSON>'s parents to know `` how much their son was admired and respected by the men he served with.'' She said she telephoned several <PERSON> Dugans </PERSON> in <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON>'s hometown of Blue Point, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, but no one knew him. Finally, Ms. <PERSON> Landers </PERSON> said she decided to break her rule and publish <PERSON> Noble </PERSON>'s name with his letter Tuesday, in hopes that a reader of her nationally syndicated column would know <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON>'s family It turned out well, but there's a risk, she noted. `` You never really know who these people are. Sometimes these people who write the most charming and warm letters can be the kookiest,'' Ms. <PERSON> Landers </PERSON> said Thursday, explaining her rule of not putting people in touch with each other. `` But I felt the letter from <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Noble </PERSON> was so sincere. I felt, well, here's an opportunity to make a whole family happy.'' <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Dugan </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, still lives in Blue Point, N.Y. But she remarried after her son's death in 1968 and said she might never have heard from Noble without Ms. <PERSON> Landers </PERSON>' help. A neighbor called early Tuesday to tell her about the column, she said, and the phone then rang all day. Noble, a 44-year-old business teacher in <LOCATION> Vista </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, also talked to Ms. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> on Tuesday after <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON>'s brother passed on her telephone number. `` We were all a little teary-eyed at first,'' Ms. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said, `` but I felt it was a wonderful tribute to -LRB- <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON>'s -RRB- memory.''

 A Panamanian decision to boycott a scheduled meeting of the board that oversees operations of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> is `` regrettable and irresponsible,'' the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The decision was also denounced by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gianelli </PERSON>, board chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>.

The commission's next meeting is set for next week in <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, but Panamanian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said Tuesday that Panamanian representatives will not attend that or any future meeting.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> announced plans Thursday to lead a three-day `` <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>'' bus trip from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to the Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said his presidential campaign also will sponsor workshops for people outside the convention hall. He said the emphasis on non-delegates is intended to strengthen the party, not steal thunder from the expected Democratic presidential nominee, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Thursday to review his convention plans and to join local civil rights leaders in work on his political action committee, the Keep Hope Alive PAC. `` We will be raising money to put the focus on areas where there is need to finance candidates running for various offices to keep building our progressive coalition of farmers and workers and men and women,'' he said at a news conference. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he is not organizing a large-scale pilgrimage of his supporters to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> for the July 18-21 convention, but said, `` thousands of people always come.'' He said the bus ride, probably starting July 14 in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, will allow him to thank his supporters and encourage voter registration for the general election. `` We just decided to come by bus rather than by <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION>. We do n't want a ship to mistake us,'' he said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> earlier had said that Sunday's downing of an Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> passenger plane by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship showed <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> foreign policy should be based more on diplomacy than sophisticated weapons. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would not comment on whether his enthusiasm for the general election might diminish if he were not asked to be the vice presidential nominee, but he suggested he will be influenced by the treatment his candidacy and platform proposals receive from the convention and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` The conclusion of those steps will in some measure determine what our fall activities will be,'' he said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Platform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will issue its streamlined party platform early next week, a party official said Thursday. Although the party's platform writers approved a roughly 3,500-word draft platform in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> June 25, they have not yet completed the task of polishing the amendments approved at that meeting. The <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign is still negotiating with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s forces over the civil rights leader's plan to pursue as many as 13 minority plants at the party's convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> July 19.

He said `` purely mechanical'' reasons had delayed issuing the amended majority report. `` People were hard to reach during the holiday weekend,'' <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> explained. A platform committee official, who asked not to be identified, said the entire report, including the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> minority planks, may be released Monday. The convention starts July 18 in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, with the delegates scheduled to take up the platform the next day. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> controlled more than a quarter of the 186-member platform committee, enough to ensure that he can carry any issue he wishes to the floor.

 Here, at a glance, is a summary of developments Thursday in the aftermath of last Sunday's destruction of an Iranian jetliner by the USS Vincennes:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PENTAGON BRIEFING</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said it was extremely unlikely that a second Iranian airplane was near <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> Air Flight 655 when it was shot down. It has been suggested that a second plane, emitting a military identification signal, might have prompted the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> captain to fire on the civilian airliner. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> backed off from its earlier assertion that the Iranian airliner was flying outside the commercial air corridor. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> also said that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> should share responsibility for the downing of the plane because it took off from a joint military and civilian airfield during an exchange of fire between the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> and Iranian gunboats and was headed straight at the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>IRAN FUNERALS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 In <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, tens of thousands of Iranians shouting `` Death to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>!'' buried victims of the attack. President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON>, the designated successor of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, led the procession with 76 coffins draped with Iranian flags. The mass funeral started with a fiery speech from <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, who mocked American statements on the incident and called for revenge.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>IRAN-AIRPORT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The manager of the airport in <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, where Flight 655 originated, said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> failed to use the proper frequency when it warned the <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> flight away from the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hossein </PERSON> <PERSON> Peroussi </PERSON>, who said he was in the control tower Sunday, denied <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> claims the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> sent warnings to the plane on both ultra-high frequency and very-high frequency radio channels. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> uses only UHF channels and the Airbus received only VHF signals. <PERSON> Peroussi </PERSON> also said transponders on the plane emitted signals `` only in a civilian mode, not a military mode.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> received both types of signals from the plane.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HOSTAGES-REVENGE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 In <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, a radical Shiite Moslem group holding two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hostages said their fate will be part of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s revenge for the 290 killed. The typewritten statement in Arabic from the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> was delivered with a photocopy of a page from hostage <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> passport.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>COMPENSATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 `` Humane and moral'' considerations will figure heavily in the decision on compensation to the families of victims of the Iranian airliner tragedy, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s chief spokesman said. Spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> emphasized that the compensation matter is under staff review and has not yet even gone to senior advisers or the president.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CONGRESSIONAL COMMENTARY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> are `` in an untenable position'' and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s policy in the region needs to be reassessed. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> called the incident `` a very straightforward error of misidentification'' but said the Iranian government `` must assume some serious responsibility for this kind of an error'' because of the attacks by its gunboats on the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> just before the A-300 Airbus was shot down.

<HEAD>Former Czech Leader Calls on Current Leaders to Follow Soviet

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, whose liberal Czechoslovak `` <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> spring'' was ended by a Soviet invasion in August 1968, urged his country's current leaders Thursday to adopt new Kremlin-style reforms. In a television interview said to be the first with a Western network since his ouster as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> called the invasion `` a heavy moral burden on our society.'' <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, 66, lost his party post in April 1969 and was expelled from the party in June 1970. Many economic and social reforms supported by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> are similar to those <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> introduced 20 years ago. He now lives as a pensioner in virtual seclusion. Austrian television interviewed him as he worked in his garden at <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Slovakia </LOCATION> about 40 miles east of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, dressed in an undershirt and shorts. `` I welcome every positive step which is made for the application of Soviet restructuring under our conditions,'' the former party chief said. `` Some people say we can not use all that, but in the last 20 years the same people have copied everying -LRB- from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> -RRB-.'' When the late Soviet leader <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> was in power, `` we had to march the way <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> ordered,'' <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> said. `` Now the same people -LRB- Czech leaders -RRB- are very selective when it comes to deciding what suits <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and what not,'' he said. `` There is a certain inconsistency in evaluating the experience. I believe that what happens in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> now is well suited for our conditions.'' <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> deplored the fact that <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> reform `` unfortunately comes after 20 years.'' In those years, he said, `` the existing backwardness has deepened, and that testifies to the fact that the invasion was not right.'' Asked for comment on the recent <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> said: `` I was always firmly convinced that ... <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s leadership will prevail. The conference has confirmed that and I am happy about it.'' <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> chided Western officials, who he said believe it is a good thing `` if socialism ares badly.'' On the contrary, he said, `` it is better for Western democracies if the Soviet leadership finally and radically distances itself from Stalinist militarism and departs from <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s dogmatism.''

 A House Judiciary subcommittee recommended unanimously Thursday that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> impeach <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> for committing `` high crimes and misdemeanors.'' The House criminal justice subcommittee voted 7-0 to send the resolution of 17 articles of impeachment to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for further action. The full committee is expected to act next Thursday. The resolution charges three main impeachable offenses: that <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> conspired with a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney to receive a bribe in exchange for modifying the sentences of two convicted racketeers, that he lied during his trial and that he compromised an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> wiretap by leaking information from it to a target. `` It ai n't over. It's far from over,'' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> said at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Courthouse in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> where he had been participating in a trial. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s first black federal judge and a fiery orator popular on the lecture circuit, was unusually terse. He refused to appear on local television newscasts. Saying he is `` legally, morally and spiritually correct,'' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> called the proceedings politically motivated and said the panel decision shows they `` do not respect the jury system.'' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> said he would continue to hear cases because there is no reason why he would have to step down. <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' lawyer, said he believes the resolution will go to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor for a vote as soon as possible. If the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> impeaches <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would conduct a trial to determine whether he should be removed from office. `` I was pessimistic, but I was surprised by the unanimity,'' said <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. `` I take it in good faith that they believe it was an impeachable offense,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. `` It's now time to prepare for a trial in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> has insisted he is innocent of any wrongdoing. The seven members voting for the resolution were Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, D-Mich.; <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif.; <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>, D-Va.; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>; <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gekas </PERSON>, R-Pa.; and <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Fish </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, R-N.Y. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, R-Ga., <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, who like <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> is black, said the decision was the hardest he has had to make during his years in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Reciting his civil rights record, including opposition to Southern judges who discriminate against blacks, <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> said, `` We did not fight that civil rights struggle to replace one discrimination with another. We can not set up a double standard. We must demand that everyone live up to high standards. `` We are not here to discuss guilt or innocence, but whether there have been high crimes and misdemeanors and pass them onto the full House. We have done that,'' <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gekas </PERSON> said the resolution contains offenses `` that were substantiated fully in the hearings.'' Fish said the hearings showed that <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> `` sought to sell his office for private gain and then lied about it under oath.'' He also said the leaking of the wiretap information `` can not be tolerated.'' `` The evidence in this matter is overwhelming,'' said <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>. `` There is no doubt that Judge <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> committed these act for which he is charged.'' In February 1983, <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> was acquitted of charges he conspired with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Borders </PERSON> to receive a bribe in exchange for modifying the sentences of two convicted racketeers. Borders was convicted in a separate trial, was sent to prison and has been released. A month after <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' 1983 acquittal, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judges </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> W. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terrell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hodges </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alaimo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> filed a complaint under the 1980 discipline law asking the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, which includes <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, to investigate <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>. After a lengthy inquiry, made longer by <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' challenge to the law's constitutionality, a five-member panel of the 11th Circuit recommended that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> begin the impeachment inquiry. The main charges against <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> criminal justice subcommittee were that <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> conspired with Borders to take a bribe, that he had fabricated his defense to secure the acquittal at his criminal trial and that he had compromised three investigations by leaking the fact that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> hada wiretap in the cases.

At least 5,000 Hungarians thronged the small Farkasret Cemetery for the reburial, including Foreign Minister <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Varkonyi </PERSON> and pianist <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bartok </PERSON>, one of the leading composers of the 20th century, was born in 1881 in <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION>. He left <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in 1940 in disgust over its close ties with <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germany </ORGANIZATION> and emigrated to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where he died five years later. `` This is a welcome home and a last farewell rolled into one solemn ceremony,'' <PERSON> Jozsef </PERSON> <PERSON> Ujfalussy </PERSON>, former director of the <ORGANIZATION> Franz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liszt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION>, told the mourners. `` His music created a new world that extended mankind's artistic horizons and tends to universality.'' `` He set a great human example for man's search for freedom and humanity, and his remains now return to a nation in quest of a newly found self-awareness,'' said <PERSON> Ujfalussy </PERSON>, author of several monographs on <PERSON> Bartok </PERSON>. As part of a Unitarian burial ceremony, Bishop <PERSON> Joszef </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferencz </PERSON> delivered a funeral oration extolling <PERSON> Bartok </PERSON>'s human qualities and moral standing. A monument of Swedish black granite, the work of scupltor <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Borsos </PERSON>, marked the burial place. <PERSON> Borsos </PERSON> said it symbolizes `` an apotheosis of music, the soul as a taking-off bird.'' <PERSON> Bartok </PERSON> was reburied next to his two wives, his mother and an aunt, and near his greatest friend and collaborator, <PERSON> Zoltan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kodaly </PERSON>. The remains were exhumed at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ferncliff </ORGANIZATION> cemetery June 21. A brass plaque that marked <PERSON> Bartok </PERSON>'s grave there was buried with him at <LOCATION> Farkasret </LOCATION>. The ceremony was broadcast live by this Communist-ruled nation's state radio and television <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartok </PERSON>, 64, who lives in <LOCATION> Homosassa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Bela </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartok </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 78, accompanied their father's remains from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on the liner Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> and then through <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. The elder son lives in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> and is president of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Unitarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. A religious choir sang the hymn `` We Have Placed Our Faith In The Lord'' at the funeral service Thursday, then <PERSON> Ferencz </PERSON>, spiritual leader of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s 10,000 Unitarians, praised <PERSON> Bartok </PERSON> for adopting the faith in 1916. `` This faith is humane tolerance itself, very much an embodiment of what he stood for as a musician and a man,'' he said. Vice President <PERSON> Rezsoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Trautmann </PERSON> spoke after the Unitarian service. He criticized some of the `` dogmatic'' events of the early 1950s, when <PERSON> Bartok </PERSON>'s music was oficially frowned upon as `` formalist'' and effectively disappeared from concert programs. `` The return of his remains now is a great solace for the nation as a whole,'' <PERSON> Trautmann </PERSON> said. At least 10,000 Hungarians and hundreds of foreign visitors Wednesday paid their last respects to <PERSON> Bartok </PERSON>'s remains at the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> building.

 More than 40 balloonists from 15 countries floated over the <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> Thursday in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s first international balloon race, with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> participants saying the weather was perfect for the three-day adventure. Balloonists, including 20 from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, came to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for the three-day <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Balloon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goodwill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fiesta </ORGANIZATION>, organized as part of a festival in the <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> highlighting <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 40th anniversary celebrations. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 48, of <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said the unpredictable desert winds forced him to make an unscheduled stop in a Bedouin village. `` We found that the winds were taking us quite a way from the main road into this village,'' he said. `` We were curious, so we made a low-level flight, about six feet off the ground, right through the village. `` When we landed at the edge of the village, the boys and the men came out to greet us,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` They were very excited. These people have never seen such a thing,'' he said. The children shouted `` <PERSON> Ahlan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wahsahlan </PERSON>,'' Arabic for welcome, when the balloon touched down on Wednesday, the first part of the race, the daily <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. Some of the American competitors said quickly shifting desert winds provided conditions that were just right for ballooning. `` It's great for balloonists,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` You can pick a current that can take you this way or that way. At home, the winds usually blow in the same direction.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 32, a lawyer from <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, agreed. `` The wind speed is less than five knots on the ground for a nice easy takeoff, and a little faster when you get up,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Arras </PERSON> of <PERSON> Redmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, took the lead Wednesday. Thursday's results were not immediately available <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said that when he landed at the end of the race Wednesday, he came down next to some camels, `` but they just walked away from us.'' Participants are ranked according to how close they come to a target, but speed is not essential, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. He said the 70-foot-tall balloons can reach an altitude of 50,000 feet, although in the current race most floated at about 2,000 feet. Balloonists can only adjust the altitude of their crafts. They navigate horizontally by latching on to wind currents taking them in the right direction. The take-off field near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arad </LOCATION>, about 35 miles south of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, was heavily guarded by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops. One soldier noted the duty was `` a nice change from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>,'' referring to previous tours of duty in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s turbulent occupied territories.

<TEXT>
 Interior Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday that a White House agency he heads is n't doing the job and ought to die a natural death. The agency is the three-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Critical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Materials </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, of which <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> is chairman. The council was established in the Executive Office of the President by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 to report within a year on inventories and prospects for certain important materials. Among other things, the council was supposed to coordinate materials research by government agencies. That could n't be done, <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said in testifying before the House Science subcommittee on transportation, aviation and materials. `` I have gradually and reluctantly come to the conclusion that this is not a workable model,'' he said, and advised the subcommittee that the legislation establishing the council be allowed to lapse without renewal in 1990. `` It is extremely difficult for a three-person council ... to move in and take a look at the very heart of mission-related departmental programs and tell the department managers how they ought to restructure or structure their research programs. There is considerable resistance to doing that,'' said <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, until a month ago executive director of the council, blamed the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> for delaying the council's first report, a report <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said was now at the printer. `` OMB directed me to delete or substantially rewrite all of these -LRB- four -RRB- factual chapters, because, and I quote, ` Giving these facts to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would be like throwing raw meat to dogs,''' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said in written testimony. He did not indicate the specific facts in question, but said the chapters dealt with `` the administration's notoriously flawed proposal to sell 96 percent of the national defense stockpile, a discussion of our recently increased dependence on the Soviet bloc for metals, the importance of South African minerals and the inequitable and noncompetitive impact of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in funding international financial institutions ... which directly subsidize competitors of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mining industry.'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said the American mining industry should be helped by the government, the council should be retained with a larger budget and <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION>'s powers should be reduced: `` I have seen it override decisions made by cabinet secretaries who opposed it. ... <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> does not want -LRB- the council -RRB- to survive or to issue its reports in any fashion that might be helpful to the public interest. Quite frankly, I do not know who is served by their actions.'' Answering questions from the subcommittee chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> McGurdy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said a single administrator `` would be stronger'' than a multimember body But the council's job, he said, might better be handled by the president's science adviser, because that adviser has experience roaming through different departments, access to the president and, just as important, access to the Office of Management and Budget.

<TEXT>
 The Piper Alpha platform destroyed in the worst offshore oil rig disaster was an assembly of flat-roofed structures and steel towers that rose 150 above the water. It was 215 feet long and 100 feet wide, among the largest of the 123 fixed platforms that dot the British sector of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil field. A fire burned constantly at its top, flaming off excess gas. The $ 901 million <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION>, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION>, began pumping oil and gas in December 1976 from its location 120 miles off eastern <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> and was among the oldest of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> rigs. Last year, the 34,000-ton platform produced a daily average of 23 million cubic feet of gas and 167,200 barrels of oil. It was linked to four other platforms in one of the most profitable sectors of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> field discovered in the 1960s. More than 200 men worked the <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION>, earning up to $ 1,000 a week in dangerous jobs. They lived on the platform for up to two weeks at a time, on a duty schedule of 12 hours on and 12 off. The <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> was pinned to the sea bed and supported by steel stilts, with most of its 649-foot height submerged. It included a helicopter landing pad used to ferry the workers out from <LOCATION> Aberdeen </LOCATION>, and had lifeboats with a total capacity of 300 people.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said Thursday he does not necessarily endorse proposals to pay compensation to the families of Iranians killed in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> destruction of a commercial jetliner over the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, whose district office in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> has been flooded with angry calls over the issue, said he had been misquoted Tuesday when questioned during a trip to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> about whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should offer compensation. `` At no time did I say anything that would lend itself to the interpretation that I was endorsing the idea,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> told reporters in his first news conference since returning from the weekend trip. Rather, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, any decision on such payments should come from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. If the president decides to offer compensation, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would likely support it, he said. In a national <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll following the incident, 61 percent of those surveyed said they did not favor payment of compensation. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Tuesday, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was asked whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should offer monetary compensation for the 290 lives lost. He responded that it was difficult to equate money with lost lives, but added: `` Yes, if that would assuage the grief of the other aggrieved party, surely we could do that ... <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would support that if it were requested.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> also called the incident `` a very straightforward error of misidentification.'' He told of a time during his service as a bombardier in World War II when what he had thought were <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> P-38 fighters began to fire on his aircraft. `` It's a human error,'' he said.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Air New Zealand Crew Error Responsible for 1979 Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The 1979 crash of an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zealand </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 into a mountain in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> was the result of crew error and not any fault of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> air traffic controllers, a judge ruled Thursday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> blamed the airline and the crew of Flight 901 for a series of mistakes that caused the plane to fly off course into Mt. Erebus, killing all 257 people on board. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> dismissed $ 32 million in negligence claims against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government by relatives and heirs of 16 of the 20 crew members who died in the Nov. 28. 1979 crash on <LOCATION> Ross </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>. The judge blamed the airline for changing the original flight plan for the sightseeing trip without briefing the crew. He also cited the crew's failure to use the airliner's internal navigation device and a weather radar system to determine its location. `` Were it not for the tragic outcome, the planning phase of Flight 901 could be described as a comedy of errors; some of these errors were perpetrated by Air <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, others by members of the flight crew,'' <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said. The change in the flight plan put the plane directly in a course over Mt. Erebus instead of down the center of McMurdo Sound. The plan called for Flight 901 to avoid the mountain by flying at an altitude of 16,000 feet. To give passengers a better view of <LOCATION> Ross </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, the plane descended without radar assistance to less than 2,000 feet in violation of <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> policy, <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said. It was flying at an altitude of 1,500 feet when it crashed into Mt. Erebus. The crew never discovered the change because it never bothered to plot the coordinates of the new flight plan, <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said. Nor did crew members bother to use the plane's internal navigation system to determine its geographical location. `` Had a single crew member performed this simple task at any time during the last hour of flight, he would have learned that the aircraft was not on longitude 165 degrees heading down the open sound, but on a longitude of 167 degrees heading toward Mt. Erebus.'' If the crew were more alert, it would have noticed that <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> was to the plane's right instead of the left _ as it would have been if Flight 901 had flown on the original course, <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said. `` The air traffic controllers at <LOCATION> McMurdo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> had no reason to suspect that these errors in the most fundamental principles of planning and airmanship had occurred, and that they had profoundly altered what would otherwise have been a safe and uneventful flight,'' <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said. `` Absent such knowledge, they had no basis for suspecting that Flight 901 was in mortal peril, or for taking extraordinary measures that even the flight crew never requested them to take,'' <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s air traffic controllers are assigned to <LOCATION> McMurdo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> to help direct aircraft used in scientific exploration by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and other organizations.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON>, a survivor of the world's worst offshore oil platform disaster, said Thursday: `` We had all that water around us and no way to get it to us We had sprinklers but they were n't strong enough.'' <PERSON> Carey </PERSON>'s remark as he lay badly burned in a hospital bed in <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Infirmary </ORGANIZATION> pointed up a bitter irony of offshore oil-drilling, one of the world's most dangerous occupations. The presumed death toll from the explosion and fire Wednesday night on the <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> platform in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> exceeded 160. Urgent questions about safety in the offshore oil and gas industry are being raised by the disaster, which brings to more than 300 the number of people who have died in the British sector of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> since gas was first pumped ashore in 1967. Drilling accidents killed 76 and a helicopter crash killed 45. Last year, six workers were killed and 59 seriously hurt among the 28,000 British workers. Three workers from <PERSON> Piper </PERSON> <PERSON> Alpha </PERSON> died after being thrown into the sea when a gangway collapsed in 1982. In 1984, a non-fatal explosion and fire forced the evacuation of 174 men. The platform, which has been producing oil since December 1976, passed its latest annual safety inspection by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> less than two weeks ago. Smoking and drinking are forbidden on oil platforms and a rescue vessel stands by each rig at all times. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brading </PERSON>, a London-based executive of <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the platform, said workmen had been installing a vertical pipe linked to a seabed pipeline that runs to a new oil field. The platform draws mixed oil and gas from under the seabed, separates them and sends them ashore through separate pipelines. When a reporter asked if sparks from an oxyacetylene burner could have ignited gas supplies passing through the platform, <PERSON> Brading </PERSON> replied: `` It is much too early to draw any conclusions.'' A company statement said the fire's cause appeared to be a gas leak. <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON>, one of the survivors, said he heard a shrieking sound just before the explosion and believed it was gas escaping from the separation system. In Parliament, lawmaker <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> claimed inspection and maintenance of rigs had been reduced in recent years, insufficient money was spent on training, and government health and safety legislation did not apply fully to the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil and gas industry. Energy Secretary <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> replied that serious <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> accidents had declined from 101 in 1986 to 59 last year. `` But that is too high a figure and we wish to keep the pressure on to ensure that improvement is maintained.'' Labor unions have complained in the past about the quality and avilability of survival gear and too few rescue helicopters. They see a conflict of interest in making the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> responsible for oil production as well as safety.

 Men jumped from the blazing oil platform or slithered down searing pipes as the heat popped windows like bubbles, but most had no chance and comrades could only watch helplessly from a nearby vessel. `` It was a case of fry and die or jump and try,'' said technican <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON>, 45, who leaped into the cold <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> to escape the flames that engulfed the giant <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> rig after an explosion Wednesday night. His face was burned and his arms were in slings. `` I was smothered with smoke. I could hardly see and could n't breathe, so it was over the side or die there,'' he said from his hospital bed in <LOCATION> Aberdeen </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> said one of the rig's survival boats floated past him and three other men. They grabbed at it and a man aboard held out his hands, `` but I could n't get a foothold. The waves were hitting me in my chest. I did n't want to drag him off so I just stayed in the water.'' Another boat picked him up half an hour later. `` We had all that water around us and no way to get it to us,'' to fight the fire, <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> said. `` We had sprinklers but they were n't strong enough. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, a 50-year-old rigger, told the <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evening </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> he waited for about 45 minutes in the crew's quarters, then he and three others decided to run for it through doors blocked by flames. `` I was n't going to sit down and get burned to death,'' <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said. `` You either stayed where you were and burned to death or you tried to get out.'' He said they fought past men on packed stairways to the lower levels of the platform, and `` I just forced my way through the flames,'' and slid down a hose and jumped. `` The water was red hot,'' <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinnett </PERSON>, 34, was on the nearby support ship Tharos because of a shortage of beds on the <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION>. `` There was nothing that anybody could do,'' he said. `` It was totally hopeless. It was like the platform had been hit by an atomic bomb. There was massive mushrooms and flames shooting into the air. I just thanked God I was n't on board.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, another rig worker, also watched from the Tharos as some of the more than 200 workers tried to get off the platform. `` We were in our survival suits ready to go to the rescue when we saw the drill derrick giving way, falling toward the pipe deck and possibly on the accommodation -LRB- crew's quarters -RRB- _ I do n't know,'' he said `` If there were men inside then, they could n't have survived. They could n't have survived all that heat. `` The heat was blowing out the windows. ... Panes of glass were all cracking off and the ferocity of the heat would suck all the oxygen out and the men inside would have smothered. It was terrible.'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Elder </PERSON>, 48, a burly <PERSON> Scot </PERSON> who also had been on the Tharos, said he watched men slide down pipes and hoses on the side of the blazing platform. `` Some were swimming from the ship,'' he said. `` I felt helpless, sick. There was panic all around. We saw 10 guys waving from the deck. There was nothing you could do.'' He waited at a hotel in a dirty undershirt and blue sweat suit, cap stuffed in his pocket, to tell his story to investigators. Elder arrived in <LOCATION> Aberdeen </LOCATION> by helicopter, with other survivors and witnesses, more than 12 hours after the disaster. Rig worker <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> said the deck collapsed as he tried to find a way through the flames. `` The cabin slid forward and a hole appeared, so we made for it and jumped,'' he said. `` We fell in the sea. It must have been 60 or 70 feet.'' `` It was stay and get toasted or jump and chance it in the water,'' said <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>, 38. He was in the water several hours before a rescue boat reached him. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lobben </PERSON>, 27, his hand burned, one wrist in a cast, said he was watching a movie when the explosion shook the platform. `` We did n't see any flames so I went down and got warm gear and a survival suit and then went on the pipe deck,'' he said. `` There was a lot of flames and smoke there. There were more explosions and the rig just dropped suddenly to one side. I was terrified. I shielded myself and jumped into the water.'' <PERSON> Lobben </PERSON> clung to a piece of debris and swam to the Tharos.

A war communique carried by the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> bombers destroyed oil installations at Imam <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> oilfield and <PERSON> Ghorah </PERSON> in an attempt to keep <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> from using its petroleum resources for `` aggressive purposes.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Iranian fighter-bombers hit <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> military positions east of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> in southwestern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Both agencies were monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> gave no specific casualty toll but said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s air raids `` inflicted substantial losses and casualties upon the enemy.'' The Iraqi agency said all <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> air force jets returned safely after carrying out 91 combat missions in a campaign to throttle <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s economic lifeline. No independent confirmation of the raids was available, nor did the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> governments immediately comment on each other's claims. Both <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> reported border skirmishes in various sectors of their 730-mile -RRB- front in the nearly 8-year-old war. The Iraqis have driven the Iranians out of their southern bridgeheads on the <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Salamcheh </LOCATION> sector in the south and the oil-rich <LOCATION> Majnoon </LOCATION> islands north of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> in consecutive assaults in the past three months. The last Iranian foothold left on <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> soil is the northern Kurdish mountains, where the Iraqis recently claimed to have recaptured more than a dozen peaks in heavy fighting. From <LOCATION> Manama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, came reports by shipping executives that radio monitors picked up a distress signal in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> on Thursday from a vessel that identified itself as a Romanian freighter and gave a location close to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. The executives said, however, that six hours later, they still had not determined that it was authentic and thought it might be another hoax. Distress signals purportedly sent by two other vessels Wednesday were not confirmed. The executives, who spoke on condition of not being identified, said the waterway might be suffering from a wave of hoaxes by irresponsible radio operators, exploiting the tense situation following Sunday's downing of an Iranian airliner by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship, killing all 290 aboard.

<TEXT>
 Federal investigators offered a $ 5,000 reward Thursday for information leading to an arrest in the placing of 13 homemade bombs under bridges and behind buildings in this community. The <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> offered the reward because of the `` inherent danger to the public safety caused by the explosive devices,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON>. The bombs were found Tuesday in this small southern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> community about 30 miles north of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky </LOCATION>. Some of the devices detonated, causing small fires, but no one was injured. <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON> said investigators continued to canvass the business district and neighborhoods, searching for clues that might lead to a suspect. `` We keep hoping each lead we run down is the one, but so far we do n't have any suspects,'' he said. <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON> declined to say whether investigators had been able to track down the source of the dynamite used to make the devices, which were found in paper grocery sacks. `` We're not going to talk about the device components. We'd just as soon keep quiet about that,'' <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON> said. `` It's normal procedure. The people we're looking for do n't need us to tell them what we're looking at.'' <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON> said there were about 35 outside investigators working on the case, representing the <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's just a big investigation, and it's taking some time to run down the leads,'' <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON> said. Life for the 6,000 Salem residents had returned to normal by Thursday. `` There's no areas blocked off, or anything like that,'' <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON> said. `` As far as I can see, things are back to normal _ other than you have a town full of strangers here running around asking questions.'' He said residents had been urged to report any suspicious packages. `` We hope there are n't any more out there, but people should be aware that there could be another one out there. We hope we got them all,'' <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON> said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday proposed legislation that would permit bank holding companies to underwrite many securities. The long-awaited bill from Rep. <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, also would require banks to cash Social Security and other government checks and abolish an agency set up to sell property from insolvent savings institutions. It would reverse, in large part, restrictions on the mixing of investment and commercial banking that have been in place since the 1933 passage of the Glass-Steagall Act. Securities subsidiaries of bank holding companies would be able to underwrite and deal in corporate bonds, commercial paper, municipal revenue bonds and securities backed by mortgages and other kinds of loans. Banks would be precluded from underwriting in two major securities areas: corporate stocks and mutual funds. However, the subsidiaries would be able to sell mutual funds underwritten by others. The legislation provides for various `` fire walls'' to prevent losses in the securities affiliate from affecting the safety and soundness of bank deposits. Other provisions require securities subsidiaries to be regulated by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Also, to prevent any confusion by consumers with insured deposits in a bank, the securities subsidiary could not share a name, logo, advertising or location with an affiliated bank. This is <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION>'s second try at fashioning a bill that would attract enough votes to pass his committee. In March, a week before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed broad legislation including bank underwriting of mutual funds and corporate stock, <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION> offered a much more restrictive bill. The latest effort is more permissive. In a statement, <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION> called it a `` consensus document'' and predicted it would get broad support in his committee and on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor. Aides said a committee vote likely will be held by the end of July. However, a spokeswoman for the banking industry's largest trade group, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said bankers, who support the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill, are disappointed with the proposal. `` The price of paying for new consumer protections far outweighs any benefits banks would get from entering new areas,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary-Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Meany </PERSON> said. In return for getting new powers, banks are being asked to cash government checks presented by non-customers, a measure aimed at helping Social Security and welfare recipients who ca n't afford to maintain a bank account. They also will be required to offer low-fee `` lifeline'' checking accounts for depositors with less than $ 1,000. Also, the bill gives a break to big competitors of banks _ so-called non-bank banks owned by <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> and other commercial companies _ which make loans or accept deposits but not both. A law enacted last summer restricted a non-bank bank's growth to 7 percent a year. However, <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION>'s legislation would lift the limit for two years. And, the bill curbs expansion of banks' insurance and real estate powers. An unrelated provision abolishes the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which has been accused of wasting money and doing a poor job of disposing of loans and real estate from closed savings institutions.

Iranian guides removed the lids from rough wooden coffins and unwrapped the plastic from around several bodies to display the corpses, many of them mutilated by the crash. `` Its a terrible thing that the superpower has done,'' said the weeping Indian to a group of Western journalists. He would give his name only as <PERSON> Farid </PERSON>. While morgue employees were preparing the bodies of at least 38 foreign victims to be returned home, those of most of the Iranian victims were flown to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> for a mass funeral Thursday. In <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, tens of thousands of people lined up behind the coffins, which were draped with Iranian flags and borne on pallbearers' shoulders to Martyrs' Cemetery. The streets reverberated with cries of `` Revenge, revenge!'' and `` Death to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>!'' as the cortege wound through the city. To visit the morgue, reporters flew to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> to the southern Iranian port of <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Flight 655 was shot down Sunday while flying in the opposite direction.

 Independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said Thursday he has referred his 830-page report on Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, a step which could result in an ethics review of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> sent the report, the result of a 14-month criminal investigation of the attorney general, to Solicitor General <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Fried </PERSON> in Fried's capacity as acting attorney general. Fried ultimately will have the authority to turn it over to the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsibility </ORGANIZATION>, which investigates accusations of improper conduct within the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. For now, however, the special three-member federal appeals court which appointed McKay has issued an order which directs that those holding copies of the report not discuss it with anyone. Asked whether an ethics review was imminent, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> said only that the report `` is being handled in the ordinary course.'' Acting on an order by the appeals court panel, <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> also sent the report to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s lawyers _ <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON> _ who refused to take reporters' telephone calls. A secretary in their office, citing the court order, said the attorneys were n't permitted to discuss the report with anyone <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said April 1 that if he decided that no criminal prosecution of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was warranted, he would refer all the matters he had investigated to `` the appropriate administrative authorities.'' When <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> announced his plans Tuesday to leave the government in late July or early August, his aides said there would n't be an Office of Professional Responsibility probe because of the attorney general's impending departure. On Wednesday, however, after other <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources disputed that assessment, <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> acknowledged that an ethics review by <ORGANIZATION> OPR </ORGANIZATION> was possible. OPR has the power to recommend sanctions ranging from reprimand to dismissal, but it also in the past has conducted reviews of employees who were leaving the department. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy attorney general, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON>, and Associate Attorney General <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, outrank Fried, but are filling their jobs on an acting basis. Therefore, the report was referred to Fried. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said anyone who believes he or she is named in the report and wishes to respond should notify the independent counsel's office, which will provide the portion of the report relating to that person <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s office launched a criminal investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> on May 11, 1987, and ended it Tuesday by submitting the report to the court. The independent counsel has been examining the involvement of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, at the request of his longtime friend <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, with scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 and 1982, when <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was White House counselor. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> also has been looking into <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s involvement, again at <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s behest, on behalf of a $ 1 billion proposed <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> oil pipeline project in 1985 <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> reviewed the attorney general's meetings with and decision on behalf of executives of the regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> telephone companies at a time when he held $ 14,000 in telephone stock. The independent counsel also looked into the fact that members of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> real estate family, through a foundation, arranged to pay a $ 40,000-a-year salary for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s wife while leasing office space to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was involved with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> in both the phone stock and Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s job.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had to destroy a Trident 2 missile in flight Thursday night, the second failure in 13 test launchings of the new submarine-based missile, authorities said. The 44-foot, $ 23.7-million missile, carrying a dummy warhead package, blazed away from a land launch pad at 6:38 p.m. EDT after a flawless countdown and darted quickly into heavy clouds. But the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> later issued a statement reporting a problem developed during first-stage flight. The range safety officer sent a radio signal 60 seconds after liftoff to blow apart the missile so that pieces would fall harmlessly into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> and not threaten land, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. The statement said the cause of the malfunction could not be determined immediately. The three-stage Trident 2 was to have hurled its warhead package to an <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> target several thousand miles to the southeast. The weapon has a range of nearly 6,000 miles but its intended range Thursday night was not disclosed. The test was the 13th of 20 land pad launches planned here, to be followed by at least five submarine launch tests. The weapon is scheduled to become operational late next year. The test program began in January 1987 and reeled off nine straight successes before logging a failure last January. It had recorded two more successes before Thursday night's malfunction. Each Trident 2 is designed to hurl up to 10 nuclear warheads to different targets. There are to be 24 of the weapons aboard each of nine planned Trident submarines.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday adopted a $ 14.3 billion fiscal 1989 foreign aid bill that would revive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contributions to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which makes development loans to Third World countries. The vote was 75-15. The measure has been remarkably without controversy this year, in part because of last year's agreement between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that smoothed the way for this year's money bills. If signed into law, the bill would be the first free-standing foreign aid money bill to be completed since 1981. Since then, aid money has been rolled into large omnibus spending measures each year. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version would provide $ 71 million as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contribution to a recapitalization of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> under a new five-year commitment to boost lending authority. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejected an attept by Sen. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, to withhold the aid unless the bank changed its practices to make loans no more favorable than those available from other sources to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> borrowers. But the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> did adopt an amendment offered by Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, to withhold $ 1.2 billion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contributions to all multilateral development banks if needed to meet next year's deficit-reduction target The House version of the bill, which was approved May 25, does not include the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> contribution, and would need additional authorizing legislation before the money could flow. The legislation is the primary vehicle for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic and military aid to friendly foreign countries. As usual, the largest chunk of aid goes to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which would get $ 1.2 billion in economic and $ 1.8 billion in military assistance. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> is the second-largest recipient, with $ 815 million in economic and $ 1.3 billion in military aid. Other major aid allocations include the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, which would get $ 125 million in military aid, $ 124 million in economic aid and $ 40 million for development; $ 500 million to an African development fund, $ 101 million to an international drug control program. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> would receive $ 500 million in military aid and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> $ 350 million. In <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> would receive $ 185 million in economic support, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> $ 80 million, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> $ 90 million, and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> $ 85 million. The bill also would continue a ban on aid to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, where strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> continues to defy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to remove him from power, including elimination of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s lucrative <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sugar sales quota The bill also includes a cut in aid to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which would receive $ 210 million in economic and $ 220 million in military aid. The total is $ 10 million less than the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> earmarked and $ 60 million less than the administration requested. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has received favorable treatment in recent years because of its status as a conduit for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the anti-Soviet rebels in neighboring <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. As the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> withdraws its troops, some in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are beginning to call for a re-examination of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. In addition, the bill makes available $ 50 million to aid Afghan refugees and $ 362 million for other refugee programs, $ 157 million for the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, $ 40 million for an international program to combat AIDS and $ 1 million for the Solidarity trade union in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.

 Apple consumption in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has risen to a record 20 pounds per person this year, good news for growers saddled with last year's largest crop in history, the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The nation has produced about 130 million 42-pound boxes of apples this season, with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> growing about 67 million of those, the commission reported. `` We never had the supply nationally to really find out if people would eat more apples,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, spokesman for the industry marketing group based in <LOCATION> Wenatchee </LOCATION>. `` A lot of skeptics have said the industry can not increase apple production because Americans will not eat more apples,'' <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> said. `` This year we've found that people will eat more apples.'' Using its own unofficial projection methods, the commission has determined that apple consumption will be 21.6 pounds per person this year, up significantly from last year's 18.4 pounds per person, St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> said. That is the only time since 1970, date of the earliest research, that apple consumption has topped 20 pounds per person, he said. Normal consumption since 1970 has been 17 to 18 pounds per person, with a high of 19.9 pounds in 1975, which was another bumper crop year, St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> said. Consumption has been pushed up this year by the combination of a massive crop, low prices and extensive marketing activities. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s 67 million boxes in 1987 easily eclipsed the previous year's record of 55 million boxes. But the huge crop lowered prices to below the $ 9.50 per box cost of production for much of the year. Only since the first of the month have prices jumped up, and currently are up to $ 19 per box for top grades, according to <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` This year has been an economic disaster from the grower's perspective,'' said <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, although the consumption projections provide a silver lining in that dark cloud The current apple season ends in August, when the remaining 4.4 million boxes of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> apples still in storage will be gone, St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> said. Early projection for the 1988 crop indicate it will be smaller, because of this year's low prices and because irrigation water supplies in the <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> are lower than normal due to last year's Northwest drought. The projections were created by the commission, which used production reports from around the nation, subtracted known exports and divided the remainder by the nation's population, St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> said. `` We came as close as we can to a true domestic consumption figure,'' he said. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, which accounts for about 90 percent of apple exports, has shipped a record 12.2 million boxes to other nations so far this year, well above last year's 5.2 million boxes. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumption figure does not take into account imports from other nations, so consumption may actually be higher, St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> said. The projections assume all apples shipped to the fresh market are sold and do not include apples processed into juice, applesauce and other products, he said. The amount of apples sold for processing, for less money, varies each year and depends on how many were undesirable for the fresh market because of weather damage or undesirable color. About a quarter of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s crop usually goes to processors, but up to a third of the 1987 crop was unfit for the fresh market. In other growing areas, up to half of the crop may go to processors.

 A bomb placed by a gang of gunmen exploded against the inside wall of a public swimming pool building Thursday, killing two people and wounding four, police said. The <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION> said the bomb apparently was meant to bring the wall down on a security patrol that was passing by in the <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>, a predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> area of west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, but the timing was wrong. The explosion missed the patrol and all the casualties were civilians, including a 4-year-old girl who was slightly injured. A police spokesman said a group of armed men came into the building and ordered swimmers to leave. They held the pool staff at gunpoint while they placed the explosive device. Police said the gunmen escaped and the bomb exploded a while later. Those killed in the explosion were a 60-year-old woman and a 24-year-old man, police said. Asked if anybody telephoned to warn police about the bomb in the interval between the gunmen's escape and the explosion, a police spokesman said: `` You'll have to draw your own conclusion about that.'' The <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> is a guerrilla stronghold and the implication of the spokesman's comment was that no warning was telephoned either because those involved feared guerrilla reprisals or because they sympathized with the guerrillas' cause. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but police said it bore the hallmarks of an attack by the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The mainly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> targets security forces in its guerrilla war to end British rule in predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite it with the overwhelmingly <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> under socialist rule.

 As growling front-end loaders bit giant chunks of debris from what had been his department store, owner <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> voiced amazement at being alive. `` I was lucky. God was with me. Not a scratch,'' he said. At least seven people died and 60 were injured when the roof of <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>'s three-story <ORGANIZATION> Amigo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION> collapsed during a driving rainstorm. Three hundred rescue workers, using everything from dump trucks to wheelbarrows, carefully dug into the debris hoping to find survivors. `` I need an ax,'' one worker high on the pile of debris shouted in English, then Spanish. Hundreds of onlookers, held back by police sawhorses, strained to get closer to the site. As Police Sgt. Dean <PERSON> Poos </PERSON> prepared to brief reporters, a woman approached and asked in heavily accented English, `` Children?'' `` No children,'' the policeman replied somberly. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> and Customs agents brought in dogs which usually hunt drugs to search for people possibly trapped. The rubble _ crushed cinderblocks, broken brick and glass, twisted steel _ was speckled with remnants of merchandise <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> had been selling moments before disaster struck. T-shirts, caps, hats, a little girl's dress were strewn in with the piles broken concrete. Several dozen rescue workers formed a human chain up the nearly three-story mound to hand debris down, piece by piece. Officials ordered them to move carefully, fearing that sudden shifts might cause a further collapse. Portable lights were hauled in so work could continue through the night. The light brown building was 19 years old and located on one of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>'s main downtown streets, about a block from the international bridge across the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Police Officer <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Saenz </PERSON>, who was near the store when the roof caved in, was among those who struggled to find survivors. `` When we got to the front of the business, we saw two persons that already looked dead. They were just between the cement, the concrete or whatever,'' <PERSON> Saenz </PERSON> said. The policemen said he and other officers managed to rescue five people from a breach in the wall of the adjacent store. `` We took them out through the wall at <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION>'s,'' he said.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Thursday questioned Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` rather late'' commitment to affirmative action and accused the vice president of breaking his pledge not to support new taxes. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, before heading West for three days of presidential campaigning, also called again on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to support trade legislation that includes a plant-closing notification provision. He refused to say whether he would select a running mate next week, but with Democratic National Convention less than two weeks away, conceded he would have to make up his mind `` in the not so distant future.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the presumed Republican nominee, promised Wednesday that he would appoint a Hispanic to his Cabinet if elected president. `` It strikes me that this is a rather late commitment,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who made a similar pledge a year ago. `` I do n't know where he has been for the past eight years.'' Like <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> refused to extend an absolute commitment to women and other minority groups but invited examination of his state appointments and said his record on affirmative action stood in `` dramatic contrast'' to the Reagan-Bush administration. `` I expect to have women, black citizens, Hispanic citizens,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, where he spoke to the annual convention <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> LULAC </ORGANIZATION>. A day earlier, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke to the same group and made his pledge to appoint a Hispanic American to his cabinet. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor continued to jab at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Some people think it's enough to wake up after eight years and then promise opportunity for one Hispanic. I want to stand with you and create opportunity for 20 million Hispanic citizens across the country,'' he said. `` I've campaigned fom one end of this country to another, and I know that we Americans are ready for a change,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> added. `` We're tired of waiting for opportunity to trickle down from a few privileged neighborhoods into our cities and into the small communities of rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made some of his remarks in Spanish. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had broken his pledge to oppose any new taxes by supporting a provision of the trade bill that calls for $ 1 billion in taxes for job training programs and catastrophic health care legislation that included $ 6 billion in taxes on elderly people who opt for the comprehensive care. `` So much for iron-clad no tax commitments,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who himself had to renege on a no-tax pledge in his first term as governor. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' hometown for the day, hit back. `` I'm against raising taxes, and I think recent events here in this state that I do n't plan to go into demonstrate we have a different view on taxes,'' he said. That was a clear reference to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' recent signing of a cigarette tax and the governor's support for another tax-hike measure The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign also quarreled with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' assertion. `` The vice president's campaign pledge not to raise tax is iron-clad and it's not going to change,'' added <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman. He said neither of the proposals <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> mentioned involved tax increases. `` He is dead wrong on both counts and he is trying to blow smoke into the room,'' <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> earlier this year vetoed major trade legislation because it contained a provision requiring employers to give 60 days' notice before closing plants The measure has won overwhelming <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval for a second time and is awaiting action in the House. `` The president opposes it, the vice president opposes it, I do n't know why,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said American workers deserved such notice and said the issue represented `` the fundamental difference in what a Democratic administration would mean to this country.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been dogged at home by a fiscal 1988 deficit and a struggle to balance the budget for fiscal 1989, which began last week. Legislation to erase the defict and close the books on fiscal 1988 is working its way through he Legislature, although portions of the administration's plan remain controversial, and a compromise on the new budget was reached Wednesday. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he expected final passage of both by the end of next week. `` If there is one thing we are committed to doing in this state it is to making sure we have a strong fiscal foundation,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. Some local <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> critics have contended that the governor has been late dealing with budget problems because he is preoccupied with his search for a running mate, a process which included interviews with eight contenders in the past two weeks. <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> removed himself from consideration. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said that none of the remaining seven have been ruled out.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> petty officer charged with murdering a disbursement officer during the robbery of a $ 94,000 payroll had plenty of money and was wrongly accused, his lawyer said Thursday in opening arguments. Petty Officer 1st Class <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON>, 34, had saved more than $ 100,000 and was preparing to leave the service after 15 years, the attorney, Lt. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Michels </PERSON>, told a court-martial panel. However, prosecutors told the five-officer panel that Colon was tailed by <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigators to the bank where $ 87,000 in cash and 2,575 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury checks were found in a safe deposit box rented in Colon's name. Colon, of <LOCATION> Vega </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, faces the death penalty if he is convicted of the murder charge. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has not executed anyone since an 1849 mutiny. Lt. j.g. <PERSON> Ratish </PERSON> <PERSON> Prasad </PERSON>, disbursing officer of the destroyer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON>, was bound, strangled and shot with a .38 - caliber handgun March 15 in a robbery of the warship's The weapon has never been found. <PERSON> Michels </PERSON> argued there was nothing to link his client to the slaying or to the items found in the safe deposit box. `` There are no fingerprints on the money or checks or the -LRB- safe deposit -RRB- box,'' said <PERSON> Michels </PERSON>, calling the government's case purely circumstantial. Evidence submitted to the court shows that Colon's driver's license was used as proof of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> residence to purchase a .38 - caliber revolver three days before But store clerk <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Crismas </PERSON> of Southside Guns, who testified said she sold the weapon March 12, said she listed the purchaser as <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> `` Cohen'' and she could n't identify the defendant in court. Dr. <PERSON> Bonifacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Floro </PERSON>, deputy chief medical examiner for the City of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, conducted an autopsy on the victim's body and concluded that the primary cause of death was a gunshot fired at point-blank range into <PERSON> Prasad </PERSON>'s left temple. He said the victim was `` probably kneeling when he was shot in the head.'' <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lab </ORGANIZATION> testified the ropes that bound <PERSON> Prasad </PERSON>'s feet and neck were similar to rope found in Colon's apartment. But <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he could find no fiber evidence from the victim's clothing or the crime scene to match that of the defendant's. Investigators had `` two primary suspects that should still be suspects,'' <PERSON> Michels </PERSON> said. The prosecutor, Lt. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Glary </PERSON>, told the jury that <ORGANIZATION> Colon </ORGANIZATION> bought a .38 - caliber revolver three days before the He also said witnesses will testify that Colon lied about his movements during and after the slaying. `` Much of the government's case is circumstantial ... but the case against this defendant is devastating,'' <PERSON> Glary </PERSON> said. Colon, who was <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> military police officer before his <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> service, is a qualified weapons expert and was an electronic warfare technician for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. He is also charged with the victim's kidnapping, which carries a life sentence; robbery, with a 15-year sentence; and receiving stolen property, with a three-year sentence. It takes a vote of at least four of the five jurors to convict on any of the charges. But the death penalty can not be considered unless the murder conviction is unanimous. The prosecution said it would introduce a bank witness who will testify that Colon rented the box in which the cash and checks were found by agents of the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The agents were tipped off by bank officials who became suspicious about renting out their largest box to a sailor. Shortly after the robbery-slaying, <PERSON> Colon </PERSON> took leave and told friends upon his return that he was going to leave the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> so he could provide a better living for his family. <PERSON> Michels </PERSON> told jurors that Colon had fathered a child seven years ago while stationed in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and that the mother had recently joined him here. Colon was arrested April 12, almost a month after the crime. The judge, Cmdr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Studer </PERSON>, said he expected the military trial to last about two weeks.

<TEXT>
 The nation's two largest financial markets took a joint step Thursday toward averting another stock crash, proposing reforms that include special attention to small investors and coordinated trading halts when the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average falls 250 points. The announcement by the boards of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> addressed many of the key issues raised by government studies on the causes of the October crash, particularly the need for cooperation between the nation's financial markets It also marked the most comprehensive action yet taken by the securities industry to reform itself since then and convince millions of crash-burned investors that the markets are safe and fair. Had the joint measures been in place Oct. 19, the unprecedented 508-point plunge in the Dow average would have been averted. `` We have developed a program of coordinated procedures which serve the current needs of financial markets,'' <ORGANIZATION> CME </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON> said. `` These combined initiatives demonstrate our commitment to serving the needs of all investors and ensuring a level playing field for all market participants.'' <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> said that although markets have returned to more normal patterns, `` there is still a perception that individuals are at a disadvantage in today's high-speed markets. The initiatives approved by the boards should overcome that concern.'' All of the initiatives must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the nation's stock markets, and the <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates the futures markets. The steps include a system for expediting trading orders of individual investors to the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> floor on heavy trading days. During the crash, many individuals were unable to sell their stock quickly because the market's system was clogged with sell orders from large institutional investors. Both exchanges also proposed a one-year experimental system of coordinated `` circuit breaker'' mechanisms to forestall panicky selling when the Dow average is falling rapidly. Under this system, which must be approved by other markets and the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, all trading on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> would be halted for an hour if the Dow average falls 250 points, and for two hours if the average falls an additional 150 points the same day. At the <ORGANIZATION> CME </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> key </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 stock-index future could fall a maximum 30 points before trading would be halted. A two-hour halt would be called if the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P index future fell another 20 points the same day. If the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P index fell a total of 50 points in one day, that market could not reopen. But the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> would have the option of reopening after a two-hour halt. The experimental reforms are aimed at taming the wild price swings in both markets that some crash studies have attributed to a trading method called index arbitrage, in which brokerages use large computers to sell stocks and buy stock-index futures, or vice versa, to profit from momentary price discrepancies. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> implemented a temporary measure called the `` collar'' in February aimed at quelling the effect of index arbitrage. The collar banned use of the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s computer system for that method on days when the Dow average rose or fell 50 points from the previous close, but its effect was controversial. Some critics said that it worsened volatility by severing an important link between the cash and futures markets. <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> said the new measures would supercede the collar limit, which is scheduled to expire in August. But he said the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> reserved the right to impose additional restrictions if volatility returned.

 Police said Thursday they had few clues to who punctured orange juice cartons with hypodermic needles at three suburban markets this week and left notes warning of poison. A national expert on product tampering warned that widespread news coverage of the cases could prompt `` copycat'' crimes and noted there were more than 700 reports of product tampering across the country last year. No one drank from any of the juice cartons, discovered Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday at three supermarkets within a few miles in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> suburbs. Police tests were incomplete, but one grocery store test cleared the first carton of cyanide contamination. Investigators have yet to find anyone who saw any of the tampering and are hampered in fingerprint checks because of the number of people who handle cartons in stores, said police Lt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. `` We're treating it as very high priority despite the fact that we do n't know for certain that there is contamination present. In either case it's still a crime,'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said. Police advised consumers, particularly near the affected stores, 25 miles northwest of downtown, to check cartons before buying. The three supermarket chains involved, <ORGANIZATION> Vons </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beta </ORGANIZATION>, all stepped up security in stores in the area, company spokesmen said. Involved were two national orange juice brands, <ORGANIZATION> Coca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s Minute Maid and <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Citrus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. In each case, a two-quart carton of orange juice was removed from the refrigerator case and punctured with the needle from a hypodermic syringe. The cartons, with the needles still attached, were found by customers or employees on shelves elsewhere in the markets, each with a note attached suggesting poison had been injected. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> law makes threats of tampering with food or drugs a misdemeanor and actually contaminating a product a felony. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is evaluating the case to see if federal felony tampering statutes apply, said spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Investigators withheld some details of the tampering to make it easier to identify possible imitators. Research suggests that one nationally publicized case of product tampering leads to 30 `` copycat'' crimes across the country, said <PERSON> Park </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Dietz </PERSON>, a psychiatrist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION> who studies such cases and has consulted for the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. `` The major determinant of how many cases there will be in the next three months is how widely this is publicized,'' <PERSON> Dietz </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` The consensus of how to handle this is to make sure the public is informed about potential risk _ in that geographic area.'' According to statistics from the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, threatened and actual product tampering increased ninefold in 1986, to 1,698 reported cases, after the death of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> woman who took a poisoned Tylenol pain capsule. In 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> received 774 consumer complaints of tampering with food, drugs and other regulated products, and confirmed 84 cases of tampering with packages or their contents. Cases of threats combined with some form of tampering, as in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> incidents, are much more rare, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, director of emergency operations for the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>. He was n't able to provide statistics on such cases.

 Striking movie and TV scriptwriters announced Thursday they overwhelmingly approved an interim contract that will put writers back to work for at least 13 production companies, including the makers of the `` Rambo'' movies. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, who cast ballots Wednesday night in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, approved the interim pact by an 8-1 margin, union President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirgo </PERSON> said Thursday. `` This will help bring this town back to work,'' <PERSON> Kirgo </PERSON> said, referring to the 18-week strike that has stalled production in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> and forced postponement of the start of the fall television season. The interim contracts with independent producers are a union effort to split the ranks of the industry's bargaining group, the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION>. Thirteen companies have already signed the new deal, including <ORGANIZATION> Carolco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>, makers of the `` Rambo'' movies, and actress <PERSON> Shelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Platypus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, union officials said. `` The significance of this vote for the industry is that there is one remaining obstacle to getting this town back to work, and it's not the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>, executive director of the union's western division. <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> predicted that the new interim agreement, in conjunction with a previously approved independent contract, would mean 300 to 500 writers would resume work in coming weeks. <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> said the producers' alliance is pressing independent companies to spurn the interim pact. The union earlier approved a different independent contract, and as of Thursday 124 mostly small production companies had signed that pact. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and CBS officials said earlier Thursday they would n't use any programming made by independent producers. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> officials had said they would not enter into new deals with independent production companies that signed contracts with the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> during the strike. `` We strongly believe that the economic issues remaining in this labor dispute with the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> are directly related to the long-term viability of the television industry,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> said through a spokeswoman. `` We feel that independent production companies, tempted to sign the interim agreements, would be prolonging the strike and contributing to further industry uncertainty without gaining any real advantage,'' she said. `` CBS completely supports the industry position in its dealings with the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION>. We do not believe it is in the best interests of any producer to sign the interim agreement the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> is offering. In support of that position, we will not enter into any new agreements for product produced under the interim <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> agreement,'' the network said in a statement issued Thursday. `` The economic issues in this labor dispute bear importantly on the continued health of our entire industry. It is clearly in everyone's best interest to end this strike as soon as possible. We believe that acceptance of the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> interim agreement will prolong this strike to the disadvantage of all,'' the statement said. `` <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s greatest hope is that this lengthy strike comes to a swift settlement, and the writers go back to work. We do n't feel we are in a position to give economic or business advice on a series of complex issues,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement released in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> earlier had confirmed separate agreements to continue production of `` The Cosby Show,'' `` A Different World,'' `` ALF,'' `` Highway to Heaven'' and `` Amen.'' Guild leaders believed a model interim contract could be used to lure a studio, network or additional small production companies to break ranks with the alliance. More than 100 independent production companies have already signed interim contracts with the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION>, allowing some writers to go back to work. Among those who have been able to resume writing is cartoonist <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON>, writer of the `` Tanner'88'' series on cable television's Home Box Office. The strike started March 7 after the two sides could not agree on payments for television reruns and foreign television syndication. Meanwhile, 20th <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> studios </ORGANIZATION> said it was imposing forced vacations on several hundred employees beginning July 11. The <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> strike has placed the start of the fall television season in jeopardy and has resulted in sweeping layoffs among <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s 230,000 entertainment industry employees The alliance has stated publicly that its last contract offer, rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> on June 22 by a 3-1 margin, was final.

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, campaigning on <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' home turf, hailed the ethnic background of his Democratic rival before an audience of Greek-Americans Thursday and disavowed any responsibility for an attack against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on religious grounds. `` I know how proud you are of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a speech to a conference of laity and clergy of the Greek Orthodox Church. `` What a tribute it is to Greek-Americans, to our political system, and to this great country of ours that we find it totally natural that the son of an immigrant is one of two men still contending to be president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, certain to be the Republican nominee. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> got a warm reception from the audience of several thousand of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' fellow Greek Americans. His address was delayed more than 45 minutes _ until after 10 p.m. _ by other speakers and the singing of Greek songs. He joked to the audience that it was wise to have <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and himself appear on different days. `` Too much charisma can be dangerous to your health,'' he said to laughter. At a news conference earlier, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> turned aside questions about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' role as <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governior in handling the state's budget and overseeing its economy `` I do n't want to get into these details,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who on other occasions has relished attacking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` I prefer to be positive and tell you what to do to lead this country ...'' The vice president was asked his view of a widely distributed letter written by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jatras </PERSON>, a staff member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> layman, who called <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` a renegade, an outcast'' for his positions and for his marriage to a Jew. `` I'm not going to get into that,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` That did not emanate from me and I had never heard of it before.'' Archbishop <PERSON> Iakovos </PERSON>, the primate of the <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION>, has said the attack was `` extremely unjustified'' and that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was a steadfast son of the church. In his speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> identified with the values of the <PERSON> Greek-American </PERSON> community. `` Family, faith, education, hard work _ those are the keys and no one knows it better than you,'' he said. `` It's the same message you preach in your homes, the same way I was raised, the same way <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s wife -RRB- and I raised our family.'' While praising <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' heritage and saying he did not want to criticize him, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went on to do exactly that, saying the two candidates had `` a different view on taxes.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor recently signed a cigarette tax. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said he would try to make clear `` who has the most experience, who -LRB- is -RRB- best to sit down with -LRB- Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>.'' The vice president added that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration `` has achieved the only arms control agreement in the nuclear age to eliminate an entire category of weapons when some were sitting up here saying ` Freeze, freeze' _ lock in Soviet superiority with a thousand warheads and zero for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' On another matter dear to Greek-Americans, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expressed hope for a resolution of Greek-Turkish differences over <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. He said the administration encourages dialogue. `` We pray for reconciliation and we seek for <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> a constitutional democracy based on majority rule, the rule of law and the protection of minority rights,'' he said. At his news conference, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his strategy, with the help of surrogates, will be to put <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' record on public display. He said one recent poll found that two-thirds of the people surveyed thought <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was more conservative than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` There's something wrong with that,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` The issues are not in focus ... I honestly believe that the country does n't yet fully appreciate where the governor stands ... on a lot of key issues. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> faulted himself for not making clear `` what makes me tick inside.'' He said, `` I've not felt too comfortable talking about the private side of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> family and all of that _ what it means to me, the loss of a child, whatever it might be.'' `` I now have concluded that I have to make clear what makes me tick inside,'' he said, referring to a speech Wednesday before a Hispanic audience in which he talked at some detail about his life. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I was trying to say, look, I understand this is what motivates me, here's the inner side.'' He jokingly said he `` was n't trying to draw a contrast that we've got 12 grandchildren and he's -LRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> -RRB- working for one.'' However, the vice president's wife quickly corrected him on the number of grandchildren and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Make that 10.''

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration on Thursday combed through a `` pretty long'' list of candidates for attorney general in hopes a successor to <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> can be nominated before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> recesses late next week for the Democratic National Convention. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is moving `` as rapidly as possible,'' but `` it's not the end of the world'' if the search goes beyond the convention recess. The Democrats meet in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> July 18. With another recess scheduled for the Republican convention in mid-August, it appears that only the least controversial of prospects could be confirmed before September. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, long an object of campaign debate, has said he will leave office in late July or early August, now that he has been `` vindicated'' by an independent counsel's decision not to seek an indictment against him. Some successor prospects would have to undergo a vigorous <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> background check. But others already have been investigated for other top-level positions, and their reviews would only need to be updated, according to <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. The ideal time for an early confirmation vote would appear to be in the first two weeks of August, before the GOP convention break. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> does n't plan to return until the second week of September. The <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which would conduct the confirmation hearing, already has a heavy schedule the last week in July, including confirmation sessions for those nominated as top <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> deputies. `` They've got time to get somebody in, but it depends who it's going to be,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., who has presided at the committee's judicial confirmation `` If they go with competence rather than ideology, they can get somebody in easily. With the right person it can be done in August. Everybody would bend over backwards to work it out. But nobody's going to rubber stamp a candidate,'' he said Added Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>: `` I think the administration is going to have to make up its mind next week.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` There really is n't anything new except to say that we are proceeding with the collection of names and processing of individual candidates, and we would like to have a nominee before the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> recesses'' for the Democratic convention the week of July 18. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the White House list is still `` pretty long. I've seen a number of news reports with a lot of names in them, and you take the longest one, and we're at least that long. Among those mentioned as possible successors to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>: former Republican Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>; former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>; the former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> attorney general under <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> B.

A statement issued Thursday by <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON>'s law office said he was not interested in the position and is committed to remain with the office he opened less than a year ago. `` In addition, no one has approached the senator about accepting the job,'' the statement said, adding that reports <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> could be a successor to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` amount to nothing more than speculation and rumor.'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON>, from the senator's hometown of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, would be the most logical choice, because he already has received a background check for his nomination as deputy attorney general. <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON>'s confirmation hearing is set for July 28. The senator, who has spoken to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Laxalt </LOCATION> are among those under consideration. `` They know I'd support <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said He declined to name anyone else under consideration. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said Wednesday he would have handled his role in connection with scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> differently if he had known at the time `` that this was a gang of crooks.'' `` Obviously, ... if you had total knowledge of what was going to be revealed later ... then there might be things you do differently,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said in an interview with reporters. `` For example, in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> matter, which was handled like I would any other ... If I had known or anybody had known ... that this was a gang of crooks, there would have been quite different handling of the situation, obviously.''

Lawmakers said several factors _ a skirmish with Iranian patrol boats, electronic data that made the approaching plane appear to be military and intelligence information that indicated heightened chance of a major attack _ combined to justify the decision of the captain of the USS Vincennes to fire two missiles at an unseen target. `` The ship's captain had every reason in the world to feel threatened,'' Rep. <PERSON> Ike </PERSON> <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON>, D-Mo., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said after one briefing Wednesday `` I do n't think he had any choice but to shoot it down.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> launched an unmanned probe Thursday night on a six-month trip to Mars' moon, Phobos, for a mission designed to pave the way for a manned voyage to the red planet. The launch of the 180-foot-tall Proton rocket carrying the probe, <PERSON> Phobos </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON>, was carried live on Soviet television, which reported that the spacecraft's flight was proceeding normally. More than a dozen nations are participating in the mission to swoop close to the surface of Phobos and drop probes onto the little, potato-shaped <PERSON> Martian </PERSON> moon that scientists say may hold clues to how the universe was formed. A companion probe, <PERSON> Phobos </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, is scheduled for launch on July 12. If all goes well, the two spacecraft will enter the gravitational pull of Mars in January 1989 and fall into orbit just behind Phobos for a three-month remote study of the surface and atmosphere of the planet.

 Unusual formations on the surface of Mars _ including a mile-long rock shaped like a human face _ may have been carved by a lost civilization or could be just `` a trick of nature,'' four scientists said Thursday. In either case, they said, the mysterious outcroppings demand further scrutiny by spacecraft. The scientists, including a former astronaut, said that a photograph taken of the Martian surface in 1976 by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Viking spacecraft clearly shows a face that could have been carved out of a Martian mountain a half million years ago. And the sphinx-like image that stares outward from the planet may be part of a complex, as evidenced by other unusual formations nearby, which was built by a civilization that has since disappeared, the scientists said. Or, they admit, it could all be `` a trick of light and shadow.''

 Most of the nation's top goals for babies and pregnant women _ including a hoped-for reduction in the infant mortality rate _ will not be met by the 1990 target date, federal health officials said Thursday. `` It's certainly sobering and concerning,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Koontz </PERSON>, a specialist with the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, Md. `` This indicates that we have some significant problems relating to maternal and infant health.'' The government in 1979 published its 1990 health objectives for the nation, including 13 top-priority goals relating to pregnancy and infant health.

 The war over, their industries wasted and their recovery prospects dim, the Japanese attached themselves to a concept that, as much as anything else, helped them rise up from the ashes. The concept was industrial quality, which presupposes that you offer a customer the very best you can produce because that, and nothing less, is what the customer expects. In concept or practice it was n't new. Americans had learned the trick years before, and its authorities on the subject were quite willing to share their ideas. A flock of them trekked to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>; the Japanese listened and improved. Now, one of the great authorities on the subject, <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Feigenbaum </PERSON>, former manager of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>'s worldwide manufacturing operations, has finished offering a revolutionary idea to the Soviets. The notion: The customer is always right. And what the customer wants, needs, demands is quality. On reading that advice, most people consider it too obvious for comment. But the fact of the matter is that it is n't at all. Time after time companies have fallen on bad times because they forget it. Repeatedly, companies have resurrected themselves on rediscovering it. And not just companies but entire nations, as witness the Japanese. The notion was all but lost in the labyrinthic Soviet production system, which for decades has emphasized production goals over customer needs, and thereby affirmed one of <PERSON> Feigenbaum </PERSON>'s basic no-nos, to wit: `` The wrong way is for the manufacturer of a product or the provider of a service to satisfy his own perceived internal needs at the expense of the customer's requirements.'' The message was delivered last month to an audience at the 32nd annual conference of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, made up mostly of Russians bent on improving Soviet production and export prowess. Will the Russians take heed as the Japanese did? And as much to the point: Will Americans remain competitive by practicing quality control; or will they forget, as they did for 20 years or so prior to the 1980s. <PERSON> Feigenbaum </PERSON>, author of `` Total Quality Control,'' a bible on the subject, is now president of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Pittsfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, company that installs quality control systems throughout the world. These are some of the points he made to the Russians, and which he suggests might draw the attention of American producers of products and services: _ Quality is everybody's job but it will become nobody's job unless management provides operating systems that support the work of individuals and promote teamwork among individuals and departments _ Quality and cost are partners, not adversaries The essence of both higher quality and lower costs is fully effective use of resources. Anything less produces waste, which means higher costs. _ Automation is no substitute for quality Unless installed as an integrated part of an overall quality system, automation merely produces the same bad products faster. _ Quality is not just a technical function or department It is an operating system that extends throughout the organization and provides the social stability and economic efficiency essential to quality. _ Quality improvement does n't come through sloganeering, bumper stickers, occasional quality fireworks called campaigns, or the dusting off of a few traditional quality-control techniques Customers perceive quality and they relate it to price. Quality shows through, he says, and when it is n't there it does n't take long for the customer to know it ... in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

 One-time friends say the man they knew as Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> told them he came here for a quieter life of medical practice and part-time teaching at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> medical school. <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> seemed to have a physician's demeanor and plenty of medical knowledge. He wore a white lab coat embroidered with his name and told stories about his teaching job. But it turns out that nobody at the university had ever heard of him and that the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION>'s Board had no record of a <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> being licensed to practice medicine in the state. And now his former friends _ remembering inconsistencies in his story that they once glossed over _ say they are embarrassed and angry they wee taken in by a man they describe as confident, extroverted, entertaining and smart. They're troubled by his criminal past and the story of his relationship with a teen-age boy who died. And they're relieved that one acquaintance `` outconned the con,'' as an investigator put it, and helped bring about his arrest. A <LOCATION> Bernalillo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury returned a 34-count indictment in April charging him with multiple counts of practicing medicine without a license in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> in 1986 and 1987. `` He was so successful at convincing very well-educated people that he's something he's not,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>, the district attorney's investigator who handled the case. `` Part of his motive was he loved the high lifestyle. He enjoyed status, enjoyed the high roller-type lifestyle.'' <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>, whose real name is <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lampkins </PERSON>, was arrested in <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, in February and is being held in the <ORGANIZATION> Bernalillo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in lieu of $ 250,000 cash bond, awaiting trial. <PERSON> Lampkins </PERSON>, whose birthdates listed on arrest records put him at 51, 54 or 56, surfaced in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> early in 1986, allegedly passing himself off as a wealthy endocrinologist and surgeon whose heart problems forced him to leave a busy and prosperous practice in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The part of the story about heart problems may be true; <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> says <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> issued medication to himself as <PERSON> Lampkins </PERSON> for treatment of a heart condition. <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> allegedly prescribed Ibuprofen, a muscle relaxant, to one woman who complained to him of lower back pain. To another friend he allegedly prescribed an antibiotic after she experienced a negative reaction from a flu shot. He is not accused of performing examinations or surgery, but of issuing prescriptions. His lawyer, public defender <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Knowles </PERSON>, declined to allow his client to be interviewed, saying, `` I just do n't like the idea of going to trial with newspaper clippings.'' Authorities say <PERSON> Lampkins </PERSON>' criminal record dates back to the early 1950s and that his convictions range from kidnapping to making false statements. He's served time at the federal penitentiary at <LOCATION> Leavenworth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, for violating the Selective Service Act and for other offenses in state and county prisons in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Then there's the story of his relationship with 18-year-old <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Teunis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Teunis </PERSON>, who lived together in the former's opulent <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, apartment, took out a $ 100,000 life insurance policy on each other in November 1982. <PERSON> Teunis </PERSON> died in a motorcycle accident two weeks later. The district attorney's office in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> has closed the case, according to investigator <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>. But it's not closed as far as <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is concerned. <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> collected $ 203,365 from <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION>, a sum that included interest and payment on a double indemnity clause. The insuror now is trying to recover the money plus $ 600,000 in punitive damages, contending that <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>, or <PERSON> Lampkins </PERSON>, misrepresented himself as <PERSON> Teunis </PERSON>' stepfather. A newspaper's legal notice of the insurance company's suit added to <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> friends' vague uneasiness about <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>. `` Things would happen to sow a seed inside you, but then nothing would happen for a while,'' said a woman whose family regularly invited <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> to dinner and parties. A small, balding man described by friends as slightly effeminate and given to talking dramatically with his hands, he was good company, highly intelligent, schooled in the arts and well-traveled. He drove a <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> and carried a business card saying he was a Ph.D. as well as a medical doctor. The woman and her husband, who spoke on condition they not be identified, said <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> avoided doctors whom they tried to introduce him socially and sometimes gave inconsistent accounts of his marital status _ divorced in one version, widowed in another. He wept while telling about the motorcycle accident that killed <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>, they said. But he said it happened in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, not <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and that the boy was an underprivileged youth his family had taken in. Every time <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> piqued the couple's suspicions, the wife said, he'd offer a gift or a compliment _ `` something nice to overcome the feelings I had.'' But the legal notice was too much. The couple discussed their suspicions with a friend who passed them on to <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Boll </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Placitas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, kennel owner who had befriended <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> through their mutual interest in dogs. `` I think several people began snapping to this person who was not who he said he was. But she pegged him as a phony and a manipulator. Eventually she out-conned the con guy,'' <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>, the prosecutor's investigator, said of Mrs. <PERSON> Boll </PERSON>. `` I talked to him almost every day,'' she said. `` Basically I played a role as his dearest and best friend. Call me <PERSON> Judas </PERSON>. That's a good name. Her motivation, she said, was to stop a phony doctor. She eventually told what she knew to the district attorney's office. An arrest warrant accusing <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lampkins </PERSON> of practicing medicine without a license _ and listing more than six aliases _ was filed last Feb. 12. <PERSON> Lampkins </PERSON>, who had fled <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> after being served with the <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> summons three months earlier, was then living in <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>. Lt. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Graehling </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION> officers knocked on his door `` We stood around for a few minutes,'' Graehling says. `` He came out the back door, which empties onto a golf course, and tried to run out back. But I had two deputies out back who arrested him. He did n't run very far.''

 Director <PERSON> Ingmar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> is turning 70, having reached what he calls the twilight of his career but basking in a run of theater successes. Recuperating from a hip operation, <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> is quietly celebrating his July 14 birthday at his retreat at <LOCATION> Faro </LOCATION>, a rugged island of beaches and pine trees in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, with some of his eight children and his fifth wife, <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>, whose films probed emotions and relationships rarely touched by others, says he has made his last movie. That was his 1982 triumph `` Fanny and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>,'' which won four Academy Awards. But he is hardly slowing down, and has theater productions scheduled in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> until 1991. In April he scored a critical and box office sensation with his stage production of <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s `` Long Day's Journey Into Night.'' His autobiography, `` <PERSON> Lanterna </PERSON> <PERSON> Magica </PERSON>,'' was a Swedish bestseller when it was published last year. His Swedish-language production of `` Hamlet,'' put in a modern setting, was panned by some critics here, but was a sensation in <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, and won a critics prize last year in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. It played in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in May. `` Hamlet is on the top 10 list of really good performances,'' <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> said in a radio interview. `` It is the best I can do, which means that I have reached quite far with it,'' His next directing project will be <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s `` A Winter's Tale,'' at <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>'s 200-year-old Royal Dramatic Theater <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> was not always the cultural hero in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> that he is today. His volcanic temper did n't help. `` He used to refer to anyone who did n't throw furniture around as ` inhibited,'' says <PERSON> Gunnel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindblom </PERSON>, one of his leading ladies. In 1969 he was fined heavily for hitting a theater critic known for his sharp reviews. `` And it was worth it,'' <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> said. Today he says the critics do n't bother him as much. `` I do n't even get angry,'' he said in the radio interview. `` Of course when you were young you took it very hard and were very hurt. But not after 45 years.'' Now, he says, `` everybody is very kind to me. ... I suppose it is because I have become old and harmless.'' His many love affairs, often with women starring in his films, drew more attention in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> than his art. But his latest marriage _ his fifth _ has lasted since the early 1970's. In his memoirs he regrets what he describes as his earlier fickleness and attributes it to sexual obsession. `` There were very many years of my life when I was so occupied with what I was doing that I forgot wives and children. Now since I am older it has been very nice and rewarding to get to know my children,'' he said. <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> was <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s youngest theater director at 26 when he was put in charge of the provincial <LOCATION> Helsingborg </LOCATION> City Theater in southern <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. The theatrical tradition, he says, has always been the real influence on his art. He is best known for directing more than 50 films, most of which he wrote himself. He won three Oscars for best foreign films: `` The Virgin Spring'' in 1960, `` Through a Glass Darkly'' in 1962 and `` Fanny and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>.'' To mark the birthday, the <ORGANIZATION> Swedish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> published a special English-language edition of its magazine, <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>, paying homage to the director who made his first film in 1944 and who launched the careers of such international stars as <PERSON> Liv </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulmann </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bibi </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> is probably the greatest film artist, all things considered, since the invention of the motion-picture camera,'' wrote <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, one of a dozen international directors contributing to the 90-page tribute. Sir <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Attenborough </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> director, said <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> `` extended the medium -LRB- of film -RRB- in a manner unequalled by any of his contemporaries.'' For some four decades <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> divided his time between theater and film, likening the two forums to `` my wife and my mistress.'' After `` Fanny and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'' he said he was giving up his `` mistress'' and devoting himself to the stage. Since then he produced only one Swedish television film in 1984, `` After the Repetition.'' `` Fanny and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'' was a multi-levelled story of a well-to-do family at the turn of the century, which appeared to have traces of <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>'s own childhood with his clergyman father. The film marked <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>'s return to <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> after six years in self-imposed exile in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. In 1976 he was hauled away by police during a rehearsal and accused of tax violations. He was cleared, but left the country in disgust. He is now back at the <LOCATION> Royal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dramatic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Theater </LOCATION>, where he saw his first play at the age of 12 and where he was the director from 1963 to 1966.

<HEAD>Widely Followed Weekly Report Is One Of Least Scientific Surveys</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN P. ROSENFELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 They often are based on seat-of-the-pants judgments rather than scientific measurements, but the government's weekly crop reports are among the most eagerly awaited figures for commodity traders, farmers and other drought watchers. Another round of reports will be released Monday afternoon and analysts will be looking to see how the nation's corn fields are standing up to dry conditions during a pollination period that is crucial to the survival of the crop. For soybeans, that make-it-or-break-it point is still weeks away. In <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, like other farm states, the reports are assembled from hundreds of questionnaires returned by farmer volunteers, government employees and bank officers who make farm loans. There are few yardsticks for the responses that, among other things, rate crops from excellent to very poor. Participants say they rely on their own judgment. `` It's probably one of the least scientific surveys we do. However, it's the most popular release we have,'' says <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Skow </PERSON>, state statistician for <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a subjective report. It's not based on measurements.'' To farmers, the figures help in making decisions on when to buy hay, corn or soybean meal to feed livestock or whether to sell livestock and break up herds because of concern adequate feed will be too costly in winter. Farmers also may use the reports to base decisions on buying or selling crop surpluses or contracting for future sales or purchases. Public policymakers are watching the figures as they consider drought-relief programs. This year, for example, reports are being distributed for the first time to members of the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> and are being circulated to members of state drought task forces. Commodity firms, traders and market watchers view the figures as an important benchmark for grain and livestock markets _ providing regular progress reports on the condition of crops months before the harvest, as well as assessments on the availability of grains and grasses used as livestock feeds. `` These numbers are closely followed by grain trade analysts,'' says <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wisner </PERSON>, an extension economist and grain market specialist at <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` They are used for a general indication of whether the crop is improving or deteriorating in condition,'' <PERSON> Wisner </PERSON> said. `` Obviously, they are not precise enough to forecast exact yields per acre, but these are good indicators.'' Last week's report for <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, for example, indicated a slight improvement in the soybean crop from the previous week, when triple-digit temperatures blistered fields. In the June 27 report, none of the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> soybean crop was rated excellent and 16 percent was graded poor. But on July 5, four percent was given an excellent rating and 12 percent was poor. In general, a normal crop is considered good, better than that is excellent and below normal is either fair, poor or very poor. The people who fill out the weekly questionnaires say it is easier to distinguish between the excellent and poor crops than to make distinctions between crops that are good or fair. `` Excellent and failure are real easy to identify,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thuma </PERSON>, extension service director and agriculturalist in <LOCATION> Henry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in southeast <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, who has been participating in such surveys for 36 years. But sometimes, a conversation with a farmer will determine how some parts of the survey are answered. Is subsoil moisture inadequate? <PERSON> Thuma </PERSON> said it is when `` a farmer tells me he dug a fence post three feet deep and did n't find water.'' In <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, 427 questionnaires go out each Wednesday, asking for ratings of crops, an assessment of the moisture content of the soil and subsoil, progress on hay harvests and general comments on livestock, weather effects, fertilizer supplies, soil erosion or related topics. As the growing season progresses, questions are added each week to track the progress of corn and soybean crops. Last week's survey marked the start of questions on corn pollination, a critical period that will determine if kernel-filled ears will develop. Tassels already have formed on some stalks and must drop pollen on silks that are beginning to form on the ears. The silks must be moist and sticky enough to catch the pollen, `` otherwise you have a cob without corn,'' <PERSON> Skow </PERSON> said. Survey participants are asked to complete the forms on Friday or on Saturday morning, and replies received Monday morning in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION> are tabulated and combined with data provided by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the state climatologist. Last week's <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> report was based on 222 questionnaires returned in time for use. <PERSON> Skow </PERSON>'s office strives to avoid sensationalizing the reports _ as he put it, `` to limit the adjectives.'' A typical passage last week said: `` The rain and cooler temperatures helped sustain the condition of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s corn crop this past week, particularly in the northern and western parts of the state. Overall the corn was in fair-to-good condition.'' This year in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, because legislators restored cut funds supporting such projects, the weekly reports not only give statewide summaries, but also have restored a section that provides figures on soil moisture and crop progress for nine areas of the state. The people who compile and contribute to the report say that even if ideal conditions return, the corn crop has suffered. `` I'm not one to overdramatize this situation, but I'm also a realist,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Brummett </PERSON>, a farmer and an agriculturalist at the extension service in <LOCATION> Taylor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> who responds to the questionnaires in his southwest <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> community. `` We're looking at a potential 40 percent to 60 percent -LRB- corn crop -RRB- loss right now in this county.''

<HEAD>Government Checks Allegations of Indian Leaders' Abuse of Rights</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 After persistent reports of civil rights abuses by Indian tribal governments, federal attorneys are quietly pressing to close loopholes that deny constitutional protection to Indians on reservations. `` We have complaints of people who have lost property or liberty without due process,'' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have evidence of undue influence on judges.'' He said the commission would hold hearings July 20, in nearby <LOCATION> Flagstaff </LOCATION>, and then prepare a report for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> including evidence from four previous hearings held around the country since August 1986. The new hearings will focus on the Navajo, the largest Indian tribe, but complaints come from many of the nation's 260 reservations, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is seeking an amendment to the 1968 Indian Civil Rights Act that would allow federal courts to review civil rights decisions taken by Indian tribal courts. `` We see a lack of checks built into the tribal government process,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Schermerhorn </PERSON>, attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` Violations are continuing, hence the need for federal review.'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and Schermerhorn said they had received widespread allegations of election abuse and favoritism based on political or blood loyalties. In interviews on reservations, Indians who described themselves as victims and private lawyers repeatedly likened the tribal governments to small `` dictatorships'' or `` police states.'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Pevar </PERSON>, a professor of Indian law at <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, asked to comment on tribal governments he had visited, replied: `` The situation is an abomination.'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ickes </PERSON>, former deputy undersecretary of the Interior and an Indian law specialist in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year, `` This is our <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>.'' He said tribal members were second-class citizens because `` they have no recourse to a judicial system that is not subordinate to the tribe's political body.'' The issue is fiercely controversial because is revolves around Indian sovereignty, established in a series of laws since reservations were established in the last century. All 1.37 million Indians have <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship, but in 1978 the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> determined that tribal courts had the final word on civil rights cases for the 332,000 Indians living on reservations. One problem, federal lawyers contend, is that Indian judicial systems are often rudimentary and vulnerable to pressure from tribal authorities. As a result, they say, a strong tribal chairman amounts to president, chief justice and speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and is in a position to control his own reelection. In the Navajo system, generally regarded as the best among tribal courts, only two of 14 judges have law degrees, and no tribal constitution sets out a separation of powers. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, chairman of the 200,000-member tribe, told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> court </ORGANIZATION> appeal would violate Indians' sovereign status. He acknowledged he was the final authority in the Navajo Nation. `` It is an awful responsibility for one man,'' he said, `` but it is in our customs and traditions.'' Former Navajo chairman <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> <PERSON> Zah </PERSON>, locked in a legal dispute over what he calls arbitrary actions by <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, takes a different view. `` I am against the idea -LRB- of federal court appeal -RRB- because it diminishes the sovereignty of Indians,'' he said. `` But this government's actions have made it necessary. We will suffer, but we have no choice.'' One witness expected to testify to the commission is <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Navajo </LOCATION> judge fired by the tribal government. He told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> judges were controlled by threats. `` It is not a free country up there,'' he said. `` It is a socialistic state. They tell you what to do.'' Problems are general throughout much of Indian country, said <PERSON> Butch </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON>, an Indian development consultant and a Sioux who lives on the <LOCATION> Navajo </LOCATION> reservation. `` It is scary when you think of it,'' he said. `` If you anger someone, your whole family suffers. If deprived of property or anything else, you have nowhere to go beyond the tribe.'' <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON> left his job as director of the <LOCATION> Crownpoint </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> when <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> took over as Navajo chairman in 1986 because, <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON> said, he expected to be forced out for political reasons. `` When -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- presidents go, a lot of people lose their jobs, but not the secretaries and janitors,'' he said. `` Here everyone can get nailed.'' In January, Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> wrote to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Indian Affairs about `` serious tribal deficiencies in applying and enforcing'' the Indian Civil Rights Act. More recently, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials have been preparing a memo to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> requesting legislation to allow federal review. <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON>'s letter cited testimony from commission hearings at <LOCATION> Rapid </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, in August 1986, which alleged flagrant abuse on several <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> reservations. Former Chief Judge <PERSON> Trudell </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerue </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Rosebud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sioux </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> said that in one five-month period prior to the hearings, he found more than 300 people arrested but not brought to court. `` We had people who'd stay in jail for 10 days without charges being filed,'' he said. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Springer </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> police officer, testified he was forced to be a witness against himself in a tribal court. `` If you're politically in, you're probably all right,'' he said. `` -LRB- Otherwise -RRB- it runs right between fear and horror and just total awe in the people.'' Indians are divided sharply on federal court review. One proponent is <PERSON> Charley </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, one of two judges <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> fired in 1978 after they refused to allow him to use $ 70,000 to pay <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> fordefending him against an <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> audit. `` Most of the -LRB- tribal -RRB- judges are fearful,'' he said. `` I think one good case brought before federal courts would put the fear of accountability back into tribal government.'' Another Navajo former judge, <PERSON> Tonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON>, told his non-Indian interviewer, `` You have more rights on a reservation than Indians do.'' But <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapela </PERSON>, a lawyer dismissed as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Navajo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> with the change in leadership, said, `` I would benefit personally, but Indians would be the losers. We must settle these things ourselves.'' <PERSON> Chapela </PERSON> argues that the Navajo should adopt a constitution, allowing them an effective recall process. A sampling of private attorneys with experience in Indian law showed widespread if reluctant sympathy for at least a limited form of a federal review. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, a former Indian legal aid attorney now practicing in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, said, `` Suppression of political dissent is the way of life'' with many tribes. `` That kind of problem is what gives rise to the critical civil rights issues.'' Attorneys pressing for federal court review complain of resistance from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> committee and the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, which they allege are interested is preserving the status quo. Some of the attorneys refer to the entrenched posture of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee, the <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> and tribal governments as `` the iron triangle.'' The result, they say, is that Indians suffer at Indian hands. But officials who oppose federal review argue that Indians should be left alone to run their tribes. Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee, repeatedly criticizes what he calls the imposition of unsuccessful solutions on Indians. `` We are convinced that the solutions are in Indian Country,'' he told a group of tribal leaders last fall in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` It's about time Indians decided on how to solve their own problems.''

 <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Benally </PERSON>, a Navajo employment officer, got some action when she complained to a local paper about favoritism in tribal civil service hiring. She was fired. Her lawyer, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapela </PERSON>, offers little encouragement for redress. He is only in private practice because he was dismissed as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Navajo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> for being, he said, in the wrong party. Civil rights attorneys say the <ORGANIZATION> Navajos </ORGANIZATION> have perhaps the best of any tribal court system, but they point to a recent scandal and allegations of civil rights abuses as evidence that individual <ORGANIZATION> Navajos </ORGANIZATION> face discrimination by tribal leaders. Chairman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, who spoke in an interview with charm and persuasion of his plans to restore Navajo prosperity, denied any wrongdoing. He has never been indicted, much less convicted. But even close associates acknowledge that recent developments provide cause for raised eyebrows. A major scandal is `` Bogate,'' the tribe's purchase of the Big <LOCATION> Boquillas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranch </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Tuba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, a year ago. Middlemen paid <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> $ 26.2 million for it. Five minutes later, the Navajos bought the ranch for $ 33.4 million. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, in an interview, said the <ORGANIZATION> Navajos </ORGANIZATION> paid a fair price and did not know what the intermediary purchasers had paid. A commission to the middlemen was normal, he said, adding: `` That's partly how business is done in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. But a principal middleman was an old associate who had raised money for <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>'s campaigns. The ranch had been on the market 20 years. Shortly after the <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> approved the purchase, <LOCATION> Coconino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> records show, <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> paid off the loan on his retirement home. The circumstances prompted separate investigations by the Inspector-General of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. All are still under way.

<HEAD>From Rock to Rodeos to Democrats, The Omni Has Seen It All</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 The rusty-looking building the Democrats will crowd into next week has been home over the years to revivals, rodeos and rock concerts; tennis, tractor-pulls and title fights; <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> and soccer. And basketball, especially basketball. The Omni arena, which opened in 1972 with a professional hockey game, was built at a cost of about $ 17 million on a platform over land owned by a group of developers who also put together the adjacent Omni International business-office-hotel complex. Since then, the building housing the businesses has been sold to <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. He changed the name to <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> after his <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, which moved into space originally occupied by an indoor amusement park. A Turner-owned company manages the arena, but it remains owned by a joint city-county authority. The arena was constructed mainly to provide a home for the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION>, a professional basketball team, said former Mayor <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Massell </PERSON>. He spearheaded the negotiations with then-Hawks owner <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cousins </PERSON>, who was also the lead developer in the larger complex. Turner now is majority owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION>. There was `` a thirst for professional sports,'' <PERSON> Massell </PERSON> said, and a hope that the arena would serve as a catalyst for development on a neglected side of downtown <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Massell </PERSON> admitted that has n't happened as rapidly as some predicted. The building's exterior was intentionally designed to rust, to cut down on maintenance costs. Its roofline of 25 pyramid-shaped pods has been compared to an upside-down egg crate, the configuration designed to provide external support and to avoid columns inside. Indoors, the arena floor runs diagonally, to give more room for 16,237 seats for basketball and to provide space in the corners for private clubs. That space is going to be at a premium for the Democrats since construction of the podium and of skyboxes for network television will reduce the seating to about 11,000, forcing off the convention floor many of the non-delegates accustomed to priority seating in the past. Little controversy has surrounded the building, aside from periodic griping about concession prices, beer drinking and drug use at rock concerts. As for the unusual name, <PERSON> Massell </PERSON> recalled that as one of the few controversies 16 years ago. He said the name `` came from the dictionary,'' which defines the Latin-derived prefix `` omni'' as `` all, universal ... without restriction.'' It's been quite appropriate considering the ice shows, circuses and conventions staged there year in and year out. <PERSON> Massell </PERSON> said the name `` omni'' was unusual when the complex was built, but the <ORGANIZATION> Omni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> was the beginning of what's become a chain of upscale hotels

 <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> is dressing up for the Democrats with the hope that the 35,000 visitors to the party's national convention will take home a rosy impression of the city. But the newly-planted flowers along <LOCATION> Peachtree </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> and the scrubbed down convention center will be unable to hide the rickety shanties of <LOCATION> Cabbagetown </LOCATION> and the thousands of homeless. This prosperous heart of the new South has a core city that ranks as the second-poorest in the nation, and activists estimate that 7,000 to 10,000 people are homeless. Leaders say they plan to make their plight known during the convention in July. <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Beatty </PERSON>, co-director of the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> for the Homeless, said there are no plans for large marches or demonstrations during the convention because the impact would be lost. Instead, with representatives of national homeless groups, task force members will occupy some of the 1,300 empty public housing units in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> for an undetermined time starting July 14, four days before the opening gavel. `` Who among the Democrats will take action to solve the problem if the problem is not visible?'' Mrs. <PERSON> Beatty </PERSON> said. `` It's nice to have 58 facilities to house the homeless, but it is kind of like letting steam out of the kettle.'' The coalition plans a `` sanctuary space,'' either in a church or large tent, where homeless can go and not fear arrest in clean-up drives. The city also decided some months ago to keep open a shelter for about 150 men that would have closed at the end of March and to add three more shelters, each housing about 30 people. Statistically, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> is an island of prosperity in the South, but the numbers for the `` <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> area'' say little about the city proper, which has only about 20 percent of the metropolitan area's 2.2 million residents Suburban <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> is composed of large, shaded lots, nice brick homes, golf courses, shopping malls and white faces. Urban <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> is overwhelmingly black with about 27 percent of the residents living below the poverty line, second only to <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Census figures. <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which includes the city of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, has an unemployment rate of 6.2 percent. The average for the four surrounding metropolitan area counties is 4.3 percent. Some of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s homeless live under a viaduct that runs past the convention site, within the projected security zone around the convention area. City officials say the indigents must vacate the shantytown for security reasons. `` I do n't see why they're tryin' to hide us. It ai n't like we done nothing wrong. We just ai n't got nowhere else to stay,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Prater </PERSON>, 37, one of the group. Mrs. <PERSON> Beatty </PERSON> fears that `` some Draconian things are going to be done.''

<HEAD>Civil Rights Leaders Remember Jackson's Movement Days</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and his days in the 1960s civil rights movement are not topics of easy conversation on the home ground of the late Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. Few among the civil rights old guard want to talk about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s time with <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> And those willing to discuss the subject sometimes paint a less than flattering picture of the man who went on to run for president. King's widow, <PERSON> Coretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, declined to reminisce publicly about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, except to say he was the one who told her King had been shot and instructed her to `` take the next thing smoking'' to <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s top aides, did not return repeated telephone calls seeking comment on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> The Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON>, the current <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION> president and a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporter, paused for several minutes when asked for movement memories of the Democratic presidential candidate. `` I do n't remember nothin','' he said. <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> City Councilman <PERSON> Hosea </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who worked in field operations for the <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s desire to work with King led to a meteoric rise in the organization and a post running its <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> departments. `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> was smart, energetic, charismatic; he really impressed Dr. <PERSON> King </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also had an obvious disdain for following rules, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said, and would use the funds he raised for his <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> operations, without prior approval of <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION> officials. King and the rest of the <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION> executive council grew tired of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s rule-bending, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said, and emotions came to a head in late March 1968. During an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> meeting five days before his death, King had a heated exchange with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and stormed out of the room in uncharacteristic anger. `` He turned around and looked at <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> and said, ` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>, if you want to start your own national organization, I understand. It's OK with me. But do n't try to destroy me in the interim,''' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. After King's death, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had other rifts with <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION> officials into the early 1970s, leading him to `` walk away'' from the organization and never return, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. One major source of friction with civil rights leaders was the bloody shirt incident. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> created an uproar when, hours after <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s assassination, he appeared in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and on national television, wearing a bloodstained turtleneck sweater and saying he had cradled King as he died Civil rights leaders were outraged. `` When I got up there, <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> was cradling <PERSON> Doc </PERSON>'s head, and <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> had gone into the room to get a towel,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` We got Doc in the car and they headed to the hospital _ <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> went with him. `` All at once I heard someone say ` I was the last man in the world King talked to.' I looked around, and it was <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>. With all the press around, he said ` All this blood on my shirt, I got it when I cradled his head.''' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was not on the <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> motel balcony when the shots were fired. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had been standing in the parking lot with the chauffeur and the Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bevel </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION> field strategist who brought <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> into the organization in 1965. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> generally declines to talk about the incident, but <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted him in April as saying, `` It happened the way I said it did.'' Later, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said, King's aides gathered and pledged their support to <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON>, <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s best friend, as the new president of <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION>. `` I remember <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> saying he was sick; he said ` I'm going to my room.' What <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> did is <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said, describing how King's horrified aides watched as <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> wore the blood-smeared sweater on the `` Today'' show and during hearings before the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` Some of those like <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> and Coretta and others have never been able to forgive <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> for that,'' he said. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, D-Ga., who worked with the <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Non-Violent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> during the 1960s, is less accusatory than <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> in his comments on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> He said in an interview that criticism of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s movement activities stem from the fact that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` did n't play the politics of the movement.'' `` I think a great many older people _ and some not so old _ that were part of the movement felt threatened by <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, by his leadership, by his ability,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. `` He had some idea about what direction he wanted to move, and set about doing just that. `` He made a very signtion in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to give the movement a solid presence in a large urban area outside the South,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> added. `` I do n't think <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> deliberately went out on a course to usurp power in the <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Bevel </PERSON>, a staunch Republican who currently works withificant contribu a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> youth organization he formed, said, `` I brought <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> into <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION>. I recommended <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>,'' he said. `` There was a struggle within the organization against the recommendation, but he was set up in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, to set that operation into motion. `` We were in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> together when <PERSON> King </PERSON> was shot,'' <PERSON> Bevel </PERSON> said. `` King got shot about 6 o'clock. And <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> -RRB- told me to go up to the temple to tell the people, because him and <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> were gnature.'' <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> was nominated on the third ballot, won the election over the divided Democrats and reluctantly appointed <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> to the treasury. The last convention year in which both major parties opened their conventions with the outcome uncertain was in 1952. Gen. <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> beat out <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON>, the choice of conservatives, for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination on the first ballot. The uncertainty was greater on the Democratic side. Eleven candidates were nominated. The front-runner, Sen. <PERSON> Estes </PERSON> <PERSON> Kefauver </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, could muster only 28 percent on the first ballot. Democratic kingmakers began to look elsewhere. Their eyes fell on <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> governor, <PERSON> Adlai </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON>, who had delivered a stirring keynote address. <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> refused to run. A draft movement was formed and on the third ballot it succeeded. The longest convention in the history of either party was the Democratic conclave of 1924 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. There were 103 roll calls over 17 days. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> passed <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> <PERSON> McAdoo </PERSON>, secretary of the treasury in the <PERSON> Woodrow </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> administration, on the 86th ballot of the political marathon in a convention divided between rural and big city elements. Humorist <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> complained that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> had invited delegates to visit the place, not live there permanently. <PERSON> McAdoo </PERSON> recaptured the lead on the 94th but released his delegates on the 99th. Wall Street lawyer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who had received just 31 votes on the first ballot, finally prevailed on the 103rd and marched off to defeat by <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Coolidge </PERSON> in November. It was the Republican convention of 1920 that produced that classic symbol of a brokered convention, `` the smoke-filled room.'' There is disagreement on whether there was actually a smoke-filled room in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> where party bosses turned to Sen. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Harding </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. But there is no disagreement that the term has entered <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> political history as a powerful symbol of a manipulated convention. According to the <PERSON> Boller </PERSON> account, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daughtery </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harding </PERSON>'s campaign manager, had predicted four months before the convention that delegates would deadlock and weary party bosses would select <PERSON> Harding </PERSON> in a hotel room meeting in the early morning hours Actually, <PERSON> Harding </PERSON> was called before <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders at 2:00 a.m., told he might win the nomination the next day, and asked whether there was anything in his background that might prove embarrassing or harm his effectiveness as candidate or president. <PERSON> Harding </PERSON> was left alone to think about it, then declared there was `` nothing, no obstacle'' to his candidacy _ a declaration that might have been less than candid considering <PERSON> Harding </PERSON>'s affair at the time with a married woman. After it was all over, according to <PERSON> Boller </PERSON>, someone called <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Boies </PERSON> <PERSON> Penrose </PERSON>, who had helped orchestrate <PERSON> Harding </PERSON>'s selection, and said he hoped <PERSON> Harding </PERSON>'s weakness for women would n't be brought up in the campaign. `` No worries about that,'' said <PERSON> Penrose </PERSON>. `` We'll just throw a halo around his handsome head and everything will be all right.''

<HEAD>Stocks Fall; Automakers Report Sales Jump</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 A selling wave has reversed an advance in the stock market, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers reported their late June sales strengthened from a year earlier. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 28.45 points Wednesday to finish at 2,130.16. The loss wiped out a 27.03-point advance on Tuesday that had carried the Dow average and other widely-followed market indicators to new highs for this year. Analysts attributed the drop partly to selling by professionals engaged in computer-program trading strategies involving stock-index futures and `` baskets'' of individual stocks. The stock market also suffered from renewed inflation worries, analysts said. Prices of some key farm commodities such as soybeans jumped late in the session on a forecast of more hot, dry weather in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. Oil prices also rose. The latest bout of inflation jitters, combined with the weaker dollar, also dragged down bond prices. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s closely watched 30-year bond dropped by $ 12.50 per $ 1,000 in face value, while its yield soared to 8.98 percent from 8.87 percent late Tuesday. In their auto sales reports, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> each said their car sales climbed in the last 10 days of June, and the Big Three automakers all finished the first half of 1988 ahead of the same period last year. Many foreign automakers also reported upturns after a slow start on the year. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> reported sales increases on both their domestic and foreign-made cars. In other economic developments Wednesday: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that only <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> among the world's industrial powers bested the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in reducing manufacturing labor costs in absolute terms last But measured in devalued dollars, labor costs in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> soared 13.5 percent compared with a 1.5 percent decline in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which had lower hourly increases in wages and benefits than any of its nine largest industrial competitors. _ Fears of higher interest rates and rising inflation weakened consumer buying plans in June as confidence in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy slipped from an 18-year high in May, according to a survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>

<HEAD>Oil Futures Rise on Technical Factors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Oil futures traders generally have disregarded a report that three <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members were calling for an emergency meeting of the cartel, but prices still rose on technical factors. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the contract for August delivery of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate crude oil settled 27 cents higher at $ 15.36 per barrel Wednesay after picking up 15 cents on Tuesday. Among refined products traded on the exchange, unleaded gasoline closed up 0.84 cent to 50.56 cents a gallon and home heating oil advanced 1.02 cents to 42.61 cents a gallon. Most traders gave little weight to a <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> report that three members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> might request an emergency meeting of the cartel, said <PERSON> Madison </PERSON> <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON>, senior energy specialist for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION>. The Kuwaiti news agency, citing high-level senior industry sources, said officials from <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> wanted <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> to consider ways of cutting production and propping up prices. Some traders were concerned about the report and the possibility of higher prices, but Wednesday's gains were the result of `` just another short-covering rally,'' <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON> said. In a short trade, an investor sells borrowed contracts in hope of replacing them later with contracts bought at lower prices. In such cases, a price rise can cause a flurry of buying as traders try to cover their positions. <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON> called the advance a correction of an oversold market, and said the underlying market fundamentals remained bearish. At its meeting last month, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil ministers failed to settle their internal problems and simply left the existing system of production quotas and prices unchanged. But that system was, and still is, in disarray. Most <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members are producing above their individual quotas or discounting their prices. Some estimates put <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production at 3.5 million barrels above the group's self-imposed overall ceiling of 15.06 million barrels a day.

 The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, trying to appease big brokers and small investors, is abandoning a post-crash limit on computerized program trading while considering a plan to give individuals speedier access to the market. Directors of the nation's biggest securities market were discussing the changes at their regularly scheduled meeting today, said sources familiar with the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s plans who spoke on condition they not be identified. Scrapping the so-called `` collar'' restraint on high-volume computerized program trades would end one of the most controversial confidence-boosting revisions undertaken by <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> in the aftermath of the October crash. The sources said there was widespread thinking, especially among large brokerages which utilize program trading, that the collar no longer was needed because the market has been relatively stable in recent weeks. The other measure, which the sources likened to a rush-hour `` express lane'' for individual investors, is designed to counter a perception that the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> ignores small trading orders in favor of the larger and more profitable transactions from big brokers and their institutional clients. <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamsin </PERSON> said she could not comment on matters before the board. But she said the collar limitation, implemented in February, never was meant to be permanent. Trading professionals gave mixed reactions to the collar news. Some called the limit useless, but others said it played a valuable role in calming the wild price swings that frightened away investors during and after the crash. Under the collar, the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> banned use of its order system for a popular form of computerized program trading called index arbitrage on days when the Dow Jones industrial average rose or fell at least 50 points from the previous close. `` If they take the rule off, I think there will be more volatility,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, president and chief executive of <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, Space, <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a brokerage in <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION> `` That means there will be less inclination for the individual to participate in this market.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and an outspoken critic of index arbitrage, said he thought the collar had helped curb computer-armed speculators from rampantly trading stocks to capture short-term profits regardless of underlying values. `` Investors are being flushed out of the system by a bunch of Star Wars guys,'' <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> said. `` Markets are going to go where they go, but I'd like to see them driven by investors, not computers.'' The individual-investor proposal before the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> board also got a mixed reaction, with some calling it a confidence builder and others discounting it as a symbolic gesture. Under this proposal, individuals placing orders of less than 1,000 shares would have a special computerized `` express lane'' to the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> floor on days when the Dow average swung more than 25 points from the previous close. During the crash, many small investors complained they could not get their sell orders to the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> floor quickly because of the congestion caused by large institutional orders. This meant individuals were forced to sell at much lower prices, while larger investors were able to sell first. `` I think the individual should have equal access,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bachmann </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and managing partner of <ORGANIZATION> Edward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a St. Louis-based brokerage. `` Anybody who thinks the individual had equal access last time -LRB- during the crash -RRB- were wrong.'' But <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Markese </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Individual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said he was not sure such a proposal would help small stockholders. `` It's holding out a hand,'' he said. `` It's going in the right direction, but it may prove to be a token gesture.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has vowed to appeal a state court ruling striking down a provision of its `` poison pill'' defense aimed at thwarting <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s hostile merger efforts. <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Cahn </PERSON> on Wednesday granted a preliminary injunction against the provision, ruling it unfairly discriminated against <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> and the company would suffer `` irreparable harm'' from <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s takeover defense. The defense would allow all of Irving shareholders _ except a hostile suitor _ to buy $ 400 worth of Irving shares for $ 200 if any suitor bought more than 20 percent of Irving stock without the support of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s management. Such provisions are intended to make unsolicited takeover bids prohibitively expensive. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Falise </PERSON> said the bank planned to appeal <PERSON> Cahn </PERSON>'s ruling, which he called `` erroneous.'' But <PERSON> Falise </PERSON> said he was pleased the judge did not reject <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s entire poison pill, which adheres to a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state anti-takeover law that prevents an unfriendly merger for at least five years <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> reaffirmed its outstanding buyout offer and said it would seek a 60-day extension from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> for conditional approval of its proposed merger with <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s approval was due to run out Saturday. <PERSON> Rodgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Cahn </PERSON>'s ruling `` should remove the single biggest question they -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- had, and that was the ability to complete the merger. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Alpert </PERSON>, a banking analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, predicted the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would grant an extension. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> had wanted to stop this -LRB- the takeover battle -RRB-, they would have spoken up now.'' <PERSON> Alpert </PERSON> said it was unlikely <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> would attempt to amass a larger stake in <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION> for fear that <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> would win an appeal that would trigger the poison pill. He also noted that even if an appeals court ruled in favor of <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> the state anti-takeover law would force <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> to operate <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> as a separate subsidiary. <PERSON> Cahn </PERSON>'s decision came a day after <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s board of directors accepted an improved merger offer from a friendly suitor, state-run <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Italiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s second largest bank. The Milan-based bank offered Tuesday to sweeten its bid for a 51 percent stake of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> with warrants entitling shareholders to buy newly issued <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> stock at $ 65 a share over the next seven years. Stockholders would receive one warrant for every four shares they currently owned. The offer was contingent upon Irving keeping its poison pill intact. <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> previously had offered $ 80 a share for 51 percent of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s 18.5 million common shares outstanding, or about $ 760 million. The blended value was as much as $ 76.50 per share. The merger proposal is part of a complex defensive restructuring plan that includes, among other things, sale of Irving assets, cost-cutting measures and a special cash dividend. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> said the latest offer made the overall transaction worth at least $ 79.50 per share, which the bank's board deemed superior to <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s `` best and final bid.'' However, estimates of the value of the offer have differed widely. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, which owns a 4.9 percent stake in <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION>, is offering $ 15 in cash and 1.575 shares of its own stock for each of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s common shares outstanding. The offer is valued at around $ 68 a share or $ 1.2 billion. The bank had offered to sweeten the rare hostile bid by slightly raising the stock portion of the bid and adding other shareholder incentives, including a special cash dividend, if <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> agreed to abandon its poison pill.

<HEAD>Samurai Sales Off 70.2 Percent in June From Year Earlier</HEAD>

 The <ORGANIZATION> Suzuki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Samurai </ORGANIZATION> collided head-on with bad publicity in June as allegations that it was prone to roll over contributed to a 70.6 percent drop in sales from a year earlier. Consumers Union, the group that blasted the Samurai, said the drop was a `` good sign'' if it was the result of the group's report alleging that the boxy, jeep-like vehicle was dangerous in certain situations. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suzuki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it sold 2,199 Samurais in June, the least since December 1985, which was the month after the vehicle's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> introduction. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> sold 7,479 Samurais in June 1987 and 6,074 in May of this year, when concerns about the <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> already had begun to spread through the buying public. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> has maintained the Consumers Union tests were biased and inaccurate, but dealers said potential buyers were unnerved by dramatic television news clips of the vehicle tilting over during driving tests. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> said it was not surprised by the decline, expected sales to increase in coming months, and remained absolutely confident of the Samurai's safety. Consumers Union, the non-profit publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, has said <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> should recall the vehicle and give refunds to owners. Asked for comment on the sales figures, <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Berliner </PERSON> said, `` If it is a reflection in any way of the public giving credence to our findings, then I think that is a good sign.'' Consumers Union said June 2 that the Samurai tends to roll over when the driver swerves sharply back and forth to avoid an accident. The <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vernon </LOCATION>, N.Y.-based group gave the vehicle its first `` not acceptable'' rating in 10 years. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> is not planning on withdrawing the Samurai from the market in response to the poor June sales, said <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Cahn </PERSON>, a representative of the company's public relations agency, <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>. He said that has been the company's position from the beginning. For the first six months of 1988, Samurai sales were down to 31,221 from 42,912 a year earlier, according to American <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Brea </LOCATION>, Calif.-based subsidiary of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Suzuki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's impossible to tell whether Samurai can pull out of this or not,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Glanz </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, who said the vehicle's reputation already was in question before the <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> report `` I think <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> will keep protesting that the product is safe and then shift production over to the Sidekick,'' a bigger, more stable vehicle that is scheduled to be introduced next spring, <PERSON> Glanz </PERSON> said. The Samurai, a four-wheel-drive vehicle, has a high center of gravity, a narrow tread width, a short wheelbase and relatively light weight. Consumers Union said that combination made the vehicle inherently flawed, but <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> said the design was sound and cited statistics showing the Samurai had a good safety record. The Samurai passed the ordinary Consumers Union test. It flunked only when the consumer organization altered the obstacle course to make it more challenging. The Samurai gained a reputation as a fun car, popular with young people, and became a best-seller almost immediately after its introduction in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It took some business away from larger and more expensive cousins, such as the Jeep Wrangler, Jeep Cherokee and <ORGANIZATION> Isuzu </ORGANIZATION> Trooper II. But sales already had begun to slow down from their torrid 1987 pace earlier this year, partly because of allegations by the Center for Auto Safety about the Samurai's propensity to roll over. Sales of the Jeep Wrangler, the Samurai's closest competitor, jumped 46 percent to 4,848 in June from 3,318 in June 1987. The Wrangler's sales were up 8.5 percent from 4,469 in May of this year.

<HEAD>Labor-Management Safety Agreement Received Coolly</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> unions and management are not ready to declare peace is at hand, despite an agreement to separate safety issues from their other disputes. `` The key word to use is ` guardedly' optimistic because there's been such an extended period of mistrust,'' said <PERSON> J.B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Eastern local of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 3,500 pilots `` You have to be somewhat cautious.'' The pact announced Wednesday comes a month after federal investigators warned that safety could be threatened at financially-troubled <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's sixth-largest airline, if its labor problems were not resolved quickly. The deal spells out procedures for the company and its 32,500 workers to discuss complaints and disagreements. `` We are optimistic and hopeful this will represent a breakthrough in relations,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, district president of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s largest labor group with 12,000 members. `` We do n't think this is going to be a total cure for all the problems of Eastern.'' <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Coughlin </PERSON>, secretary-treasurer of the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> local, representing 7,000 Eastern flight attendants, said her union was skeptical of the deal but supported any attempt to improve safety. `` We're willing to cooperate on anything, but the problems are not going to be solved until our people can go to work and not worry about being fired,'' she said. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON>, a company spokesman, said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> would not characterize the agreement beyond a statement by President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON>, who said the pact would keep safety out of collective bargaining issues. But Bakes also noted it was essential to complete negotiations on economic issues with the machinists and pilots unions. Former Labor Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>, chosen by federal officials June 2 to find ways to ease <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s labor-management relations, said he found `` tensions were accelerated to an unbelievable level'' between the two sides. Years of disputes, including lawsuits, lobbying in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and negative newspaper advertisements, have made passengers afraid to fly Eastern and had created a situation where the airline is losing $ 1 million daily, <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> said. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> <PERSON> IV </PERSON> called the agreement `` a good beginning'' and said federal inspectors would continue stepped-up monitoring of Eastern `` to assure the flying public that it remains a safe, fit airline.'' Rank-and-file reaction to the safety agreement seemed mixed as reports reached <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> employees in its <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> base. A mechanic fired 18 months ago said he was skeptical about how well the deal would ease tensions. `` There have been so many things done to people and their families, it would be awfully hard to forgive and forget,'' said the mechanic, who asked that his name not be used because his case is in federal arbitration. A flight attendant arriving at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> said she found it encouraging that `` some agreement, any agreement was made. You have to start somewhere,'' said the woman, who like many <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> employees asked that her name not be used. The pact calls for the establishment of a master safety committee consisting of top company and union officials, which will help resolve safety problems pointed out by employees. Panels will be established throughout the country at which local managers and union leaders will attempt to resolve issues such as captains' authority, the handling of calls to the company's complaint lines, training of maintenance workers and a study of workplace injuries `` The document is worthless if there is not compliance,'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> told reporters. `` We have a collective bargaining agreement -LRB- which -RRB- has been blatantly violated consistently by this management. So there was some reservation about putting a lot of confidence in this document.'' A measure of the continued mistrust was the inability to get management and union leaders to appear together at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> news conference. Eastern has been marked by labor-management conflicts for more than a decade, as a period of cooperation under former Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Borman </PERSON> deteriorated and led to the money-losing airline's sale in 1986 to Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s management led by Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> heightened tensions by saying <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> had to cut its labor costs by up to 30 Eastern lost $ 241 million last year, and <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 466 million. The Machinists, in federal mediation with management since January, have refused to take wage concessions of up to 50 percent for some non-mechanics, such as baggage handlers. Eastern says it ca n't reverse its losses without the concessions. A group of Eastern pilots testified before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year that they were pressured repeatedly to fly aircraft they considered unsafe. The agreement pledges that, `` No employee will be harassed, threatened or disciplined for reporting or causing to report an unsafe condition on an aircraft.'' Federal officials conducted special inspections of aircraft flown by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> last spring and also examined <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s management and finances. They announced they had not found unsafe conditions but warned of possible safety problems because of the labor-management battles. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in April proposed an $ 823,000 fine against Eastern for recordkeeping and maintenance infractions. Fourteen months earlier, the airline had agreed to pay a record $ 9.5 million penalty.

 Federal prosecutors say information gathered from <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> and others caught up in the snowballing Wall Street insider trading scandal led indirectly to unprecedented stock manipulation charges against <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>, two subsidiaries and the corporation's vice chairman were indicted on numerous securities law charges Wednesday for an alleged scheme to manipulate the price of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> common stock <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> made an unsuccessful hostile takeover bid for <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 and kept alive the threat of another attempt until it sold much of its Carbide stake in late 1986. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said the indictment marked the first time `` a corporate entity was charged with stock manipulation'' in the government's widening probe. The 10-count indictment charged <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>, two subsidiaries _ <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemicals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Jay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>'s vice chairman and chief administrative officer with conspiracy, stock price manipulation, securities fraud, wire fraud, causing the creation of false brokerage records and obtaining improper margin loans to finance stock purchases. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>, N.J.-based chemical and building products conglomerate, said the board of directors had expressed its full confidence in <LOCATION> Sherwin </LOCATION> as well as `` its deep disappointment in the government's decision to bring these unprecedented charges.'' The spokesman said the company and <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> intended to defend themselves vigorously against the charges and were `` confident of complete vindication.'' The indictment alleged the stock price manipulation was conducted through the Los Angeles-based brokerage firm of <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which was not charged with any wrongdoing. The company's founder, <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>, has been cooperating with investigators and pleaded guilty in March 1987 to two felony charges arising from the <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> insider trading scandal. <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>, who faces a maximum 10-year prison term, has yet to be sentenced. `` <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s connection to this matter is indirect,'' said <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> cooperated and as a result of his cooperation we were able to develop a case on Jefferies. <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> cooperated and among other things he revealed this particular situation.'' <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>' cooperation and the investigation were continuing. He declined to say if additional indictments were in the works. The <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> indictment alleged that <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON>, acting for <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>, had two unidentified <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> employees make <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> stock close at or above a specified price over several days in late October 1986. According to Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Loewenson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the indictment charged <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> with plotting to drive up the price of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>'s stock `` to attract buyers and to maximize the profits'' <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> could earn by selling its Carbide stock. The indictment further alleged that <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> promised <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> would pay <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for any losses the brokerage incurred on such trades. At the time, <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> owned nearly 10 million shares, or 10 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>'s outstanding common shares. <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> bought large amounts of <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> stock _ and lost money _ near the close of trading on Oct. 29 and 30, 1986. The indictment contended that boosted the price of Carbide common stock. The indictment said one of <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON>'s alleged co-conspirators at <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> sent him a $ 40,000 invoice for fictitious advisory services. <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> allegedly approved payment of the invoice, and <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> made out a check payable to <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. On Nov. 10, 1986, <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> sold 5 million shares of Carbide stock to <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> for nearly $ 115 million <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> cooperated with investigators. According to the indictment, <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> never sent the $ 40,000 <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> check to <LOCATION> Jefferies </LOCATION>. After the news media reported that <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>, chairman of the brokerage, had been subpoenaed by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in the <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> investigation, <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> allegedly instructed his secretary to void the $ 40,000 check. If convicted on all counts, <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON>, 54, of <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, faces a maximum 50 years in prison and up to $ 2.5 million in fines. The charges against corporate defendant carry maximum fines of up to $ 5 million each.

<HEAD>Atlanta Fed Researchers Say Huge Fees Worth The Price In Big

<TEXT>
 A study of the fees paid to investment bankers in friendly business mergers concludes that such payments, which may total millions of dollars, are no more excessive than the transaction fees paid to real estate agents. Researchers <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> stated their review of 125 friendly mergers between 1979 and 1985 indicated `` the bankers' fees, though large in absolute terms, are only a small percentage of the economic value created by the mergers.'' `` On average, when measured against the gain that the merger creates for the new entity, ... the fee approximates that of a typical real estate transaction,'' said the researchers, who figured the average fee equalled about 6.6 percent of the economic gain created by the mergers. Furthermore, the investment bankers' fees averaged a `` very reasonable'' less than 1 percent of the total transaction price, with the highest being 3.4 percent of the price, <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said. The study was published in the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s Economic Review publication. The researchers limited their survey to friendly mergers of public companies and did not look at those where investment banks provided only fairness or underwriting services. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said it was the first survey to compare fees with services rendered. The mergers ranged in value from $ 34 million to $ 6 billion, with fees ranging from $ 100,000 to $ 20 million. The two largest fees came from the $ 2.8 billion deal in 1984 that joined <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Esmark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and the $ 5 billion merger in 1985 of <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION> with the <ORGANIZATION> Signal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc.. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said each deal paid $ 20 million to the investment banks involved _ <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lazard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freres </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beatrice-Esmark </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Lazard </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Allied-Signal </ORGANIZATION> The wave of mergers and acquisitions in recent years has brought more attention to the fees paid investment bankers, with some critics claiming the fees are excessive. Trade publications have discussed the fees in articles with titles like `` Merger Fees That Bend the Mind'' and `` Wall Street's Overpaid Young Stars. The merger departments of three separate Wall Street firms each earned $ 200 million in 1985. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said the attention and worry have caused some merger-minded companies to consider a do-it-yourself approach. But <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> argued against bypassing the investment bankers. `` Bringing together of buyer and seller and advising on what price to pay _ from that point of view, -LRB- investment bankers -RRB- seem to be well worth their fee,'' <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said in an interview. `` Firms contemplating a do-it-yourself approach simply because fees charged by professional merger intermediaries appear excessive would do well to scrutinize the costs and benefits of self-search,'' <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> wrote. The researchers note that investment banks traditionally have provided a range of services, including underwriting, market-making and advice on capital structure, dividend policy, mergers, acquisitions and divestitures. `` While other financial institutions provide many of these same services, the investment banks' specialization and expertise in corporate financial matters, along with their position overlooking capital markets as a whole, give them a comparative advantage that permits them to command handsome fees,'' they wrote. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> also said investment bankers are constantly gathering and assessing information on corporate assets, research that would have to be done otherwise by individual suitors.

<HEAD>Domestic And Imported Auto Makers Report Late June Sales Increases</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Car shoppers in a healthy economy, lured by sophisticated incentive programs, are likely to keep on buying at the higher-than-expected rates of the first half of the year, industry analysts say. The big three domestic automakers on Wednesday reported a jump in their sales rates during the June 21-30 sales period. Combined domestic car and light truck sales totaled 459,918 during the late-June period this year, against 359,784 in the same period last yera, a jump of 13.6 percent in daily sales rate. The late-June period had nine selling days this year and eight in 1987, so percentage comparisons are made on the basis of daily sales rates rather than total sales. Combined domestic car and light truck sales totaled 1,120,962 for all of June, an 8.5 percent increase in daily sales, and 6,184,576 for the year through June 30, up 11 percent from the first half of 1987. `` We see sales for the rest of the year as pretty good, with a possible soft spot in October,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Grady </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>. A late-year lull might occur as buyers wait to see what incentives will be offered on newly introduced 1989 models in dealers' showrooms, he said Among imports, car and light truck sales totaled 333,066 for the month, down 7.6 percent, and 1,874,004 for the first half, down 1.5 percent. For the June 21-30 sales period, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> sold 89,927 cars, a 27.4 percent jump in daily sales. For the year through June 30, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> sold 1,161,574 cars, a 12.8 percent increase over the first half of 1987. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> sold 144,205 cars in late June, an 18 percent jump, and 1,952,402 for the first six months, a 4.9 percent increase. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> sold 40,817 cars in late June, up 8.4 percent a day, and 574,609 for the first half of 1988, up 14.3 percent. <PERSON> O'Grady </PERSON> said sales were helped by the apparent success of new models at some automakers, such as General Motors GM-10 models. He also said sales were helped by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers' increasing adeptness at offering incentives, with shorter programs and more frequent changes in affected models, smoothing sales peaks and valleys the programs once triggered. `` The combination of record employment and a need to replace old vehicles gave the industry a good start this year,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> vice president <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rewey </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> sold 30,049 domestically made cars and 33,279 imports in June, up from 25,015 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> made cars and 31,078 imports last June. Toyota sales of U.S.-produced cars for the month reached 3,066, up from 1,228, and its imports rose to 54,906 from 47,584 last June. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> sold 49,957 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> produced cars in the first half of the year, down 23.4 percent, and 24,644 imported cars, down 67.3 percent.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Gillette Issued Misleading Reports On Proxy Rival</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> inaccurately portrayed a New York-based partnership during a proxy battle earlier this year but did not mislead shareholders by withholding information about potential buyers, says a federal judge. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> issued his ruling Wednesday but withheld a decision on whether to invalidate an April shareholder vote that defeated a dissident slate of directors nominated by the investment group <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>. The judge postponed that decision until after further testimony by <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> on alleged proxy violations by <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>. In a prepared statement, <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> said it was `` surprised and disappointed'' by the ruling on the advertisements. `` While <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> disagrees with -LRB- the -RRB- ruling and believes its conduct was proper, its immediate efforts will be directed vigorously toward the further critical issues in the case relating to <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>'s conduct,'' the statement said. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> principals were not in their <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> offices when called for comment Wednesday. During the trial, which began June 20, both sides alleged violations and misrepresentations occurred during their nearly three-month proxy battle over four seats on the <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> board of directors. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> ruled that several newspaper advertisements by <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> during the proxy solicition contained `` falsely misleading'' information about <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said he still was reviewing whether <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> violated full disclosure laws in its filings with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. He also ruled that <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> was not required to provide stockholders with names of companies interested in acquiring the Boston-based company, including <ORGANIZATION> Ralston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Purina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Busch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. At least 10 companies have signed agreements not to seek control of <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> without first notifying <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> management, according to court testimony Most of the pacts expire in November. <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> on April 14 filed suit seeking to block <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>'s proxy bid on the grounds <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> falsified <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filings and did not fully acknowledge all of its investors, including Swiss finacier <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> <PERSON> Tettamanti </PERSON> Judge <PERSON> Rya </PERSON> <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON> allowed the suit but rejected the bid for the temporary injunction. A countersuit by <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> filed on April 19 alleged <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> misrepresented <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> in advertisements and mailings to the company's 27,000 shareholders and failed to publicly disclose the companies that had expressed interest in buying <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> shareholders rejected the dissident <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> slate by a 52 percent to 48 percent vote during the April 21 annual meeting. The candidates _ <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> partners <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gollust </PERSON> and cable television executive <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Strassler </PERSON> _ had indicated they would urge the 12-member <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> board to sell the company. Two <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> subsidiaries own 6.76 million <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> shares, or about 5.8 percent of the shares outstanding. <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON> withdrew from the case June 11 on the grounds that she and <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> Chairman and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Colman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mockler </PERSON> are affiliated with <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>.

 A last-minute competing proposal for the recapitalization of a financially troubled bank holding company has delayed federal regulators' decision on the institution's fate, according to published reports. The Dallas Morning News and <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> each reported Thursday that sources told them <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest bank holding company, has submitted a preliminary proposal for acquiring and reorganizing the troubled <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> banking company, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The Morning News said a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said the agency's board was unlikely to strike a deal Friday, as had been predicted by <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> chairman. `` I imagine it would be unfruitful to wait for an announcement this week,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Katsanos </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> officials had reportedly said Wednesday that they were looking at First RepublicBank's situation. First RepublicBank's management last week submitted a bid that would keep the company independent <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> told a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> news conference that `` we are expressing an interest'' in <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> but that `` the next step is up to the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>.'' Neither he nor <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> officials would comment further on the plan. Last week, a 20-member team from <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> conducted a four-day inspection of First RepublicBank. Last March, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> approached the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> for a federal bailout after rising losses from problem loans and large withdrawals of deposits. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> have pumped billions of dollars into member banks of the state's largest such holding company. First Republic reported a $ 1.5 billion loss in the first quarter. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> has predicted the institution would suffer another substantial loss in the second quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> is the largest bank holding company in the nation with $ 203 billion of assets on March 31. First Republic had assets of $ 28.4 billion on March 31.

Several <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market watchers said dealings were extremely listless for most of the day. `` It's just a torpid market,'' one equity salesman said.

<HEAD>Jobs Ads Edged Up in May, Conference Board Says</HEAD>

 The pace of new hiring slowed during May as the steady improvement in labor conditions leveled off, a research group said Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, a business-financed research organization, said its help-wanted advertising index edged up three points in May to 160. The index measures the monthly volume of classified advertising in 51 major newspapers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The group said such advertising increased moderately in all sections of the country, except for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, which saw a 4.1 percent decline. Elsewhere, the gains ranged from 6.5 percent in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-Pennsylvania </LOCATION> area to 0.5 percent in the <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> region. Job growth in the second half of the year is expected to lag behind the first half of 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said. `` This should be good news for those still concerned about the economy overheating and setting off inflation sparks,'' said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, an economist for the organization. With the latest employment data showing little change, new hiring is unlikely to rise sharply in the next few months, <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> said. May's 5.6 percent unemployment rate matched the March level. `` All of this suggests that the long, steady improvement in labor market conditions has run its course,'' he said.

 Stock prices headed lower today in a carryover of selling from Wednesday's drop. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 28.45 points on Wednesday, lost another 12.63 to 2,117.53 by 2 p.m. today on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 9 to 5 in the overall count of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 499 up, 885 down and 516 unchanged. Analysts said the market's downturn Wednesday from 1988 highs reached earlier in the week intensified recent concerns that the early-summer rally in stock prices might be topping out. In addition, interest rates rose today in the credit markets. Yields on long-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds have climbed of late back above 9 percent, driven in large measure by recurring worries about inflation. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is due to report Friday morning on the employment situation for June.

His stellar record got him into law school without benefit of a high school diploma. After law school, <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> worked for Republican Gov. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>, but was bounced from a post as assistant secretary of state in 1965 after refusing an order to take unpaid leave instead of vacation to work on the mayoral campaign of <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Beame </PERSON>. -LRB- <PERSON> Beame </PERSON> lost that race to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON>. -RRB- In 1968, <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> was elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to fill the seat of Republican <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Fino </PERSON>, who had been appointed a judge. He has been re-elected every two years, with overwhelming majorities; he became known as a law-and-order Democrat, an advocate of hand-gun control and an opponent of British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. But one office always eluded him: he desperately wanted to be elected mayor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Why did he want to be mayor? `` Why do people climb the Himalayas?'' he replied. In 1972, he made a run for the job and looked to be a shoo-in for the Democratic nomination, which in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> is tantamount to election. But <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s candidacy was destroyed by a series of investigations and allegations, which culminated in his being proven a liar. At the time, <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> was questioned by a grand jury looking into allegations of payoffs to congressmen who sponsored certain immigration legislation. When reports surfaced that <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> had taken the Fifth Amendment before the panel, he vehemently denied it. He sued to have some, but not all, of the record made public. But the tactic backfired when the judge released all the minutes, proving <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> had in fact asserted his right to not to incriminate himself. <PERSON> Beame </PERSON> was elected mayor and <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> went back to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. In 1986, new accusations were leveled at <LOCATION> Biaggi </LOCATION> and these began to stick. First, he was indicted for illegally accepting paid vacations in exchange for using his influence to steer federal contracts to Coastal Dry Dock and Repair, a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> shipyard. He was convicted of taking a gratuity, illegal interstate travel and obstruction. But he wept when he was sentenced to 2 -LCB- years in prison and fined $ 500,000. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> is appealing the decision. A second indictment accused him of using the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a Bronx-based machine company, as a racketeering enterprise. The case is now on trial in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> is charged with accepting millions of dollars' worth of company stock, issued in his son's name, in exchange for helping the company get military contracts His son and four others are on trial with <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>. The House of Representatives forced <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> to relinquish his subcommittee chairmanships after the first indictment last year and to refrain from voting after his conviction in September, but those moves were slaps on the wrist compared to what was to come. In February, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Official </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION> recommended that <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> be expelled for `` criminal conduct ... going to the heart of his representational responsibilities.'' In an unusual maneuver, however, congressional leaders decided to delay action while <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> defended himself in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> trial in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. It is unclear when the resolution may be brought up, but <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> has resolved to fight it. It must pass by a two-thirds vote of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. Asked what his defense would be, he said simply, `` Truth.'' <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> has not denied taking the two vacations to a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> spa, which were paid for by former <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> Democratic boss <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON>. `` He's a friend of 40 years,'' <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> said. `` It boggles the mind.'' At the time, however, <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> owed <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON>'s insurance company $ 280,000 in premiums. <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> was himself convicted of paying illegal gratuities and given a two-year suspended prison term and a maximum fine of $ 500,000. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> compared his situation to that of former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Labor Secretary <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON>, the first sitting Cabinet member to be indicted. <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> was acquitted in May 1987 of larceny and fraud charges that forced him from office in 1985. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, however, was convicted. Still, he bristled at comparisons to Rep. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> `` Ozzie'' <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, D-Pa., the last congressman to be expelled <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, ousted in 1980, was convicted of bribery after being videotaped taking $ 50,000 in the Abscam sting. `` I do n't think the case is comparable,'' <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> said. `` His was for bribery. You're talking about a gratuity.'' Despite his legal woes and editorials urging him to resign, <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> said he is `` absolutely'' running for an 11th term. As a convicted felon, however, he wo n't even be able to cast a vote for himself.

<HEAD>Airlines Step Up Security in Wake of Persian Gulf Incident</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The big <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines that fly overseas say they are taking no chances with retaliation from terrorists and have stepped up their defenses in response to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s downing of an <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> jetliner. `` We take the threat seriously,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Heckscher </PERSON>, a spokesman in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' international division. The incident in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> last weekend, which killed nearly 300 civilians, has raised fears of a retaliatory attack by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Political experts have suggested that revenge could take the form of a terrorist assault against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases or personnel overseas, or against other American targets _ including commercial airline flights. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kierce </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s director of international security, said the airline has taken steps to ensure that its already tight security precautions `` are being exercised to the fullest.'' <PERSON> Kierce </PERSON> said the airline also has added some new measures at several airports, which he declined to name. Those measures include having a senior member of management on duty whenever a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> plane is on the ground at those locations. <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's seventh-largest airline, has been the target of some of the most notorious terrorist attacks against jetliners in recent years. In June 1985, Lebanese Shiite Moslems hijacked a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> flight over the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> and diverted it to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, where they killed a passenger. The hostages were n't freed until 17 days later. Terrorists set off a bomb in the passenger cabin of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner over <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> in April 1986, killing four Americans. Other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines that carry passengers abroad also have been on alert following the <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> disaster, beefing up security in the midst of the peak summer travel season, experts say. Like <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>, most big carriers have their own security divisions but also contract with outside security companies for passenger screening in airports and other protective services. Many of the airlines are touchy about security and refuse to discuss what they're doing. But they emphasize that anti-terrorist defenses are always intensified after such an incident. `` -LRB- The airlines -RRB- do n't need a crystal ball; it's so obvious,'' said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lally </PERSON>, assistant vice president for security at the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based trade group that represents the nation's major carriers. The airlines have most likely tightened their security in consultation with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lally </PERSON> suggested. <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said there is always `` heightened awareness'' of security when a potential terrorist attack looms. `` Our security, we believe, is overall very, very good,'' she said. In addition to its <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, which sells security, maintenance and other services to government agencies and other airlines, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> also has an internal security division. After <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>, Pan Am probably has the highest profile among the American carriers that are active overseas. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has increased security at some of the foreign airports it uses, spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> said. United, the nation's largest carrier with scores of domestic flights, has all its overseas operations in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> In a similar way, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> specializes in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as its foreign market. `` We are taking additional precautions,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Musto </PERSON>. Eastern, a subsidiary of giant <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, was the target of several hijackings to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> between 1979 and 1981, but drug smuggling is now its biggest security headache. Airlines from countries that are identified as close allies of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could also be potential targets of the Iranians' ire <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s national <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has a reputation as the world's toughest carrier when it comes to security In some instances in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> has kept its flight routes secret from passengers until they actually boarded the plane. El Al also sometimes uses planes of a subsidiary that do not carry the carrier's bright blue logo. `` We do n't talk about our security. We just do it,'' said <PERSON> Aviva </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavi </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> in its <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office, refusing to say whether the airline had tightened security as a result of the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> shooting.

 A massive oil rig fire off the coast of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> will worsen a shortage of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil, but the disaster is not likely to have a big impact on the industry, experts say. The fatal accident, which caused a jump in world oil prices Thursday, prompted the government's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> to postpone the process for granting new off-shore licenses, which would open up more areas for exploration. The department had been scheduled to announce on Thursday the blocks for which it was inviting bids for the licenses. `` Because of what happened, we've decided to postpone that at the moment,'' said a department spokesman, who spoke anonymously in keeping with British practice. The price of Brent Blend, the most widely traded international crude oil, jumped on Thursday to $ 15.05 a barrel for September delivery, up 32 cents from late Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> rig </ORGANIZATION>, said a gas leak apparently was to blame for the disaster. The rig produced 167,200 barrels a day, the company said. A barrel contains 42 gallons. In addition to the Piper oil field, five other fields were shut down, the department said. They were the Claymore, Tartan, <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Scapa </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Petronella </LOCATION> fields, it said. That meant production was cut by a total of about 220,000 barrels a day to 250,000 barrels a day, or about one-tenth of the British sector's production, the department and analysts said. `` There's pressure on the immediate availability for <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> crude,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, an oil analyst with the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Warburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON>, an oil analyst with the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoete </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wedd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, added, however: `` That's going to be fairly short-term.'' The related fields should be back in production in a week, and <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> probably will be out of production for up to a year, Ms. <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said the industry already was experiencing a shortage because of regular maintenance, which oil companies generally do in the summmer when the weather is milder. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil production in the British sector averages 2 -LCB- million barrels a day, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> says. Production is down 400,000 barrels a day from that level because of the maintenance, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said. Producers of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>, of which <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is not a member, will step in to meet demand, Ms. <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON> said. The oil price also has been boosted by favorable statistics released this week, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said. `` There is starting to be a perception that the glut in world supplies in general is not as bad as people thought,'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION>'s production wo n't be severely affected by the fire, because it has other outlets, Ms. <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON> said. There were concerns about claims against the company, however, and <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION>'s stock fell 50 cents to $ 26.25 in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The stock price of <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. PLC, the biggest producer in the British sector, fell 3 cents to $ 4.49 in afternoon trading on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> The disaster could prove expensive for the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil producers in general, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said. `` Obviously, questions are going to be raised about safety which might involve companies in a lot more expenditure,'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said. The British sector of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil fields runs from the <LOCATION> Shetland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> down to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Anglia </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s southeast coast, covering hundreds of thousands of square miles The first British sector gas fields were discovered in 1964 and oil production began in 1975, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> said. The sector employed 28,000 people in offshore facilities at the end of last year, it said. There are 123 fixed installations, including the <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> platform, in the British sector, with 40 mobile rigs, the department said.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s latest nominee for a seat on the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> was accused Thursday of attempting to dodge taxes in negotiating a $ 2.5-million `` golden parachute'' compensation agreement with the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> bank holding company he heads. `` I am concerned about it,'' Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said of the agreement at the end of a confirmation hearing for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaWare </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Shawmut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> LaWare </PERSON> said `` I'm not sure a tax dodge was involved'' in the compensation agreement, which he said was offered to assure him that his annual income of about $ 500,000 would be continued until he reaches age He turned 60 on Feb. 20. Despite <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>'s concern that the bank _ not <PERSON> LaWare </PERSON> _ is obligated to pay a special excise tax on a portion of the pay agreement, there was no indication the issue would affect LaWare's nomination In fact, <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> told <PERSON> LaWare </PERSON>, `` You are a very impressive candidate for the job.'' However, committee aides say some Democrats are reluctant to see the nomination approved because it would mean that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would have filled all seven seats on the board, which controls the nation's money supply. These senators are hoping that fellow Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will be elected president and could promptly fill the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> seat after taking office next January. <PERSON> LaWare </PERSON>, a registered Democrat, would replace <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallich </PERSON>, who resigned. The 14-year term would expire Jan. 31, 2002. <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> told reporters he will confer with committee members before deciding whether the panel should vote on the LaWare nomination this year. Should the panel recommend the nomination, it would be up to Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, to determine whether the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> should consider the nomination this The issue of monetary policy was barely mentioned at the hearing. Most questions were about the federal budget and trade deficits, the increasing share of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> debt held by foreign investors and Third World debt. <PERSON> LaWare </PERSON> said he is little concerned about the fact that only one of the world's 10 biggest banks is American. `` I do n't think that makes much difference,'' he said. `` It's how well-managed and profitable they are ... I am more concerned with the profit-and-loss statement'' than with size. None of the other committee members took up <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>'s line of questioning about the `` golden parachute'' agreement, which was negotiated earlier this year as part of the merger that created <ORGANIZATION> Shamut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Similar agreements are used to reward executives when control or ownership of a corporation changes. In 1984, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> required recipients of such arrangements to pay a 20 percent excise tax on the portion that the law considers excessive. In addition, corporations were barred from taking a tax deduction for the excessive payments. Under <PERSON> LaWare </PERSON>'s agreement, which he acknowledged to be worth about $ 500,000 a year, the corporation itself is obligated to pay the 20 percent tax. <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> estimated that would save LaWare about $ 200,000 in taxes. `` How do you justify such an attempt to dodge the tax code?'' <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> asked. The idea behind the 1984 law, he said, `` was to discourage excessive payments which officers and directors vote themselves.'' `` I'm not sure it's a dodge,'' <PERSON> LaWare </PERSON> said. `` The tax is being paid, regardless'' and the federal government is losing no money, he said. <PERSON> LaWare </PERSON> must pay income tax on the full amount of the `` golden parachute'' payment, including whatever amount the bank chips in to cover the special excise tax.

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said its profit jumped 53 percent in its fourth quarter from a year earlier, boosted by a lower tax rate, good volume growth in consumer foods, strong performance by key restaurant chains, and significant productivity gains. The food giant reported Thursday that its profit for the quarter ended May 29 rose to $ 54.9 million, or 65 cents a share, from $ 36.1 million, or 41 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1987. Fourth-quarter sales increased to $ 1.3 billion from $ 1.2 billion a year earlier. For fiscal 1988, which was one week shorter than fiscal 1987, earnings rose 27 percent to $ 283.1 million, or $ 3.25 a share, from $ 222 million, or $ 2.50 a share. Sales in fiscal 1988 were up 10 percent, to $ 5.2 billion from $ 4.7 billion the previous year. The earnings report for the fourth quarter includes the discontinued specialty retailing operations of <ORGANIZATION> Talbots </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>. General <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> will post a $ 200 million gain after taxes in the first quarter of fiscal 1989 from the sale of the retailing companies. General Mills Chairman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said the consumer foods division achieved a 4 percent increase in domestic packaged food volume, leading to annual sales and operating profit gains of 9 percent and 11 percent, respectively. The company said the success of several new microwave food products and growing acceptance of Yoplait yogurt and other new foods contributed to the earnings increase. Spending on Big G cereals for the fourth quarter was particularly strong, as both volume and market share grew, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said. In the restaurant division, <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lobster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Garden </ORGANIZATION> operations were up 16 percent. Both <PERSON> Leeann </PERSON> <PERSON> Chin </PERSON>'s and <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s reported losses, including charges of $ 12.9 million related to closing unprofitable units, which caused total operating profits to be down 4 percent During the fiscal year, the company invested $ 411 million in new assets, an increase of 25 percent from a year earlier. Major investments were for new food capacity, new and improved Red Lobsters, new Olive Gardens, and investments for improved efficiencies, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Control Data To Convert Disk Drive Operations Into Separate
Subsidiary</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will convert its disk drive operations into a separate subsidiary, a possible prelude to a sale or partnership for the billion-dollar unit. Analysts said the reorganization would make it possible for <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> to attract a joint-venture partner or a buyer for the unit, which accounted for nearly $ 1 billion of the company's $ 3 billion in revenue last year. Disk drives are devices used for storing and retrieving computerized information at high speed. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON>, a company spokesman, said creation of the subsidiary `` will enable <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> to explore the full spectrum of opportunities for data storage products in the future. Those include joint venture, partnership, acquisition or divestiture.'' <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> on Wednesday confirmed the contents of a June 29 memo from <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> executive vice president and president of the data storage products group. <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> had not planned to announce the move because it was `` an internal reorganization.'' In addition to the memo, the creation of the subsidiary was disclosed in the July 1 issue of Current, an internal <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> publication. Subsidiary status also will make the disk drive operations more competitive and free <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION>'s financial resources for use in other areas, he said, but he provided no details. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Easterbrook </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said, `` It would be easier to sell a subsidiary A buyer can more easily see separate books, separate profit-and-loss statements, that are not so meshed-in with the rest of Control Data ... It makes it easier for him to think of a price,'' he said. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Smaby </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Needham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, said, `` The strategy has been set in motion that could lead to the spinning out, refinancing or restructuring of that business'' within the next two years In the refinancing area, the subsidiary might raise additional capital through the sale of stock, <PERSON> Smaby </PERSON> said. `` It's a way to raise capital on their own, if they need capital to be competitive, without having to pull it from the mother corporation.'' <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> confirmed that the data storage products group could sell stock in itself to outsiders. As a group or division of <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> it could not do that, he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Italiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s second largest bank, may be forced to abandon its friendly merger plans with <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> if it fails to win regulatory approval to pay <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> shareholders a special cash dividend, experts said Thursday. That could be a boon to <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, which has been bidding for control of Irving for more than nine months, the analysts said. Regulators already have raised serious concerns about special payouts, with one top official from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> saying they should be considered only by banks with more than adequate capital. `` It seems a little odd that this -LRB- the special dividend -RRB- comes into play right now,'' when the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is trying to standardize international bank capital adequacy requirements by 1992, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a banking analyst with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Keefe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bruyette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>. `` 1988 has been a year when most major money-center banks have been building capital, not paying out extra dividends,'' he said. But a proposed $ 10-a-share special cash dividend is a key element of <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION>'s offer to buy a majority stake in <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION> as an alternative to <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s hostile bid. The Milan-based bank is offering $ 80 a share for 51 percent of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s 18.5 million common shares outstanding and the special dividend for the remaining 49 percent. Earlier this week it sweetened the offer to include warrants entitling shareholders to buy newly issued <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> stock at $ 65 a share over the next seven years. Stockholders would receive one warrant for every four shares they now own. The offer is valued at a minimum of $ 79.50 a share. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, which owns a 4.9 percent stake in <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION>, is offering $ 15 in cash and 1.575 shares of its own stock for each of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s common shares outstanding. The offer is valued at around $ 68 a share or $ 1.2 billion. `` From a practical standpoint I would think if the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> was to disallow the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- special dividend ... that would place pressure on BCI to increase its offer in a tangible manner,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>, a banking analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` I would n't think it would have to be a dollar-for-dollar match. I do n't think the market expected the full $ 10 to go through anyway. That was a major ` if.''' A number of analysts agreed that at some point it might no longer be economically feasible for <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> to continue with the deal, leaving <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> alone with <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s persistent takeover advances `` I believe it -LRB- current offer -RRB- already is at the upper end of the range,'' said <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON>. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Skigen </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Willkie </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Farr </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION>'s legal adviser, said her client remained committed to the Irving merger. `` The offer that we made is outstanding,'' Ms. <PERSON> Skigen </PERSON> said. She contended the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s reservations about special dividends, contained in a letter dated Wednesday to all three banks by <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> executive vice president <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schadrack </PERSON>, was meant solely as a `` a spot policy statement to the world at large.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> also must determine whether to grant <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> an extension of conditional approval for its proposed merger with <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> asked for 60 more days on Thursday; the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> approval was due to expire Saturday. In addition, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> appeals court will be faced with deciding whether a provison of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s anti-takeover `` poison pill'' is valid. It was struck down by the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, but <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> has vowed to appeal. In other developments Thursday, a court-appointed referee refused to change the outcome of a crucial proxy vote in which shareholders re-elected <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s board of directors over <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s nominees. The referee did decide, however, that a block of 450,000 votes of Irving shares belonged in <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s camp and that an amendment to <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s bylaws alolowing 10 percent of holders to call a special shareholder meeting had passed.

Yields on long-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds have climbed of late back above 9 percent, driven in large measure by recurring worries about inflation.

<HEAD>Commission OKs One-Share, One-Vote Rule</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> voted Thursday to limit the ability of American companies to weaken the voting power of their stockholders as way of fighting hostile corporate raids. The new one-share, one-vote rule, approved 4-1, does not altogether ban dual classes of common stock, but rather spells out how shares with reduced voting power can be issued. One popular takeover defense, in which companies entice stockholders into giving up their voting rights by offering a special one-time dividend, would be prohibited. Also barred would be rules that require a stock purchaser to wait, sometimes for several years, before newly acquired shares accrue full voting rights. Companies will have to comply with the new <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> rule if they want their stock traded on an exchange or through the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION>' automated quotation system. However, in another voting rights area, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> decided to defer to the states. In states that allow it, companies will be permitted to deny voting power to takeover raiders unless the other shareholders approve. About a dozen states have adopted such laws and the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, in friend-of-the-court briefs, has argued that they improperly interfere with national securities markets. In unrelated action, the commission voted unanimously to back off from recommending congressional legislation barring brokerage firms from requiring customers to agree in advance to settle disputes before an arbitration panel. State securities regulators and others have been arguing that so-called `` pre-dispute arbitration clauses'' in the fine print of account agreements are unfair because they require customers, in some cases unwittingly, to sign away their right to sue in court before they know the nature of any disagreement that may arise. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ketchum </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s division of market regulation, said he doubted the new one-share, one-vote rule would have a dramatic effect on takeovers. But he conceded that in a few cases takeovers would be easier because the rule eliminates some `` extremely effective'' defenses. Commissioner <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, the only member to vote against the rule, said he believed the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> was intruding into an area that has traditionally been left to states: the chartering and governance of corporations. `` I believe this is an improper use of the listing standards to tamper with corporate governance,'' he said. However, <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said the rule is structured `` to be as least intrusive as possible.'' Companies will still be permitted to issue new shares with diluted voting power. Diluted-power shares can also be issued to accomplish a merger. And private companies going public will be able to issue both strong-voting and weak-voting shares. However, corporations will not be able to issue `` supershares'' that have more voting power than common stock already issued. That would have allowed company insiders, such as managers, to buy up the strong shares to acquire control over the company. Stocks of foreign companies traded in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be exempted from the regulations. The 359 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies that had disparate voting rights before Thursday will also be exempted, as will the stocks of small companies listed in the <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION>'s so-called `` pink sheets'' and traded by brokers over the telephone. Despite the exceptions, the rule drew praise from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shareholders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which is headed by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilman and takeover specialist <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s action helps to restore democracy to corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said in a statement. Commission debate over the rule approved Thursday began nearly two years ago when the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in September 1986 asked for <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> permission to drop its 60-year-old one-share, one-vote standard. Exchange officials said they were dropping the standard reluctantly out of fear of losing business to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, which had more liberal rules, and the <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION>, which had no such standard. Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and others have argued that the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> does not have jurisdiction over the matter and should defer to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> However, Commissioner <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischman </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has not acted in two years and that the law requires the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> to approve or disapprove changes in exchange rules. On the arbitration issue, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> voted to ask the stock exchanges and the <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION> to study pre-dispute clauses and to report back to the commission by Oct. 15. Nevertheless, Reps. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>, D-Va.; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., have gone ahead and introduced a The head of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents state regulators, called the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> decision `` disappointing.'' `` Small investors will see the commission failure to act as another sign that the deck is stacked against them,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, president of the association and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>'s top securities regulator.

 The Australian airline <ORGANIZATION> Qantas </ORGANIZATION> has ordered two <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747-400s and one 767-300 with extended range capability, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The planes will be delivered between September and December 1989 and will cost about $ 380 million, including spare parts and support, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> said in a news release. <ORGANIZATION> Qantas </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> J.B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> said the new planes, which will give <ORGANIZATION> Qantas </ORGANIZATION> a 43-plane fleet, will serve the growing tourist market to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. The airplanes will be financed by <ORGANIZATION> Qantas </ORGANIZATION>' foreign exchange earnings and by overseas borrowings, he said. The order gives <ORGANIZATION> Qantas </ORGANIZATION> six of the advanced-technology 747-400s, the world's largest commercial jetliner, and five extended-range 767-300s. The four-engine 747-400, which made its first flight this spring, can carry up to 660 passengers. With a more typical configuration for 412 in two classes, the plane can fly more than 7,300 nautical miles, or from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION>. The twin-engine 767-300 is capable of hauling up to 375 passengers, but can fly more than 7,000 miles with 210 aboard. So far this year, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has had orders for 401 jetliners worth $ 18.2 billion, compared with 366 jets worth a record $ 19.9 billion in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> now has 148 orders for 747-400s and 103 orders for 767-300s.

<HEAD>FMC Gets New Bradley Fighting Vehicle Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A $ 289 million contract for continued production of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has been awarded to <ORGANIZATION> FMC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s ground systems division, the company said Thursday. Work on the 334 infantry and 216 cavalry Bradley Fighting Vehicles and 44 <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> carriers for the multiple launch rocket system will be done at the company's <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> plant. Delivery is scheduled between May 1, 1989, and April 30, 1990. The contract provides $ 280 million for the products, and $ 9 million in a price-incentive contract to provide engineering support in production. Last December, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> they planned to thicken the armor on the vehicle to make it 50 percent `` more survivable'' in battle. Other changes announced included redesigning the fuel system, moving some ammunition around inside the crew compartment and developing explosive armor. The first Bradley Fighting Vehicle was delivered in 1982. <ORGANIZATION> FMC </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, delivered about 3,100 Bradleys out of an order of 6,880 for $ 1.55 million each as of last December. Most of the vehicles have been stationed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Congressional, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and FMC records show numerous mechanical and electrical components on the vehicle designed as an amphibious armored personnel carrier have failed repeatedly in recent years. But Col. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Trapnell </PERSON>, system manager for the <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s Training and <ORGANIZATION> Doctrine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Benning </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, has said that the vehicle may have flaws but going into a war without it would `` cause us to lose and do a lot of dying in the process.''

 Most grain and soybean futures prices plummeted their limits for daily trading Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, taking some analysts by surprise and leaving them divided on the reasons for the move. On other markets, gasoline futures soared and other energy futures also gained; livestock and meat were mixed; precious metals advanced; and stock-index futures gained. `` I'm astounded,'' <PERSON> Katharina </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>, New York-based grains analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said after the grain and soybean markets closed. Most corn, soybean and oat contracts plunged their respective 15 -, 30 - and 10-cent limits for daily trading, and the limitless contracts for July delivery fell even Wheat contracts for December, March and July 1989 delivery tumbled 20 cents a bushel, the limit in that market. Despite new forecasts for weekend rains in the dry and dusty <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON> said the sell-off was technically inspired. `` This market has nothing to do with fundamentals any more,'' she said. Instead, she said, Thursday's action was dominated by so-called technicians, who base their trading decisions on historical chart patterns. On Thursday, the charts indicated it was time to sell, Ms. <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON> said. More likely, the drop was caused by a combination of technical and fundamental factors, said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, grain specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Though prices turned lower shortly after the opening, <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> said the sharpest drop followed midday news reports that <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., had said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> may consider measures allowing farmers to plant soybeans and oats on a portion of their acreage idled under government crop programs But <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, speaking to the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> probably would not act on the matter for at least another month. Private forecasts for moderate rainfall this weekend in the northern Corn Belt also pressured the markets, <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> said. `` The market continues to show its sensitivity to prospects of getting even a little bit of rain,'' he said. `` That's nonsense,'' countered Ms. <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>, who dismissed the expected rain as `` sprinkles.'' `` To tell an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> farmer we're locked limit-down because of the rain we're going to get, I do n't know what they'd say, but it probably would not be printable,'' she said. Wheat settled 15 -LCB- cents to 20 cents lower with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.78 a bushel; corn was 14 -LCB- cents to 22 cents lower with July at $ 3.20 a bushel; oats were 10 cents to 22 cents lower with July at $ 3.01 a bushel; soybeans were 26 cents to 49 -LCB- cents lower with July at $ 9.34 -LCB- a bushel. Prices for future delivery of unleaded gasoline and heating oil soared on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to Wednesday's weekly <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> report showing a sharp drawdown in gasoline supplies, analysts said. Energy futures were broadly supported by reports that the tragic explosion of a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil rig could cause production of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> crude oil to fall by 30,000 barrels a day, said <PERSON> Nauman </PERSON> <PERSON> Barakat </PERSON>, energy analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Crude-oil futures declined on profit-taking in the second half of the session, he said. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 43 cents to 55 cents higher with August at $ 15.83 a barrel; heating oil was 1.37 cents to 1.68 cents higher with August at 44.29 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.23 cents to 2.56 cents higher with August at 53.12 cents a gallon. The inflationary implications of higher energy prices supported precious metals futures on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, analysts said. Gold settled 40 cents to $ 1.20 higher with August at $ 441.10 a troy ounce; silver was 11.5 cents to 13.6 cents higher with July at $ 6.935 a troy ounce. Livestock and meat futures finished mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The drop in grain prices prompted reversals of recent drought-related trends in the cattle and hog markets, and pork bellies rebounded sharply after touching 8-year lows on Wednesday, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hare </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Linnco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Live cattle were .60 cent lower to .15 cent higher with August at 64.75 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .38 cent higher with August at 74.75 cents a pound; hogs were 1.50 cents lower to .83 cent higher with July at 45.40 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .70 cent lower to 2 cents higher with July at 34.40 cents a pound. Stock-index futures finished higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for September delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's index settled 1.20 points higher at 273.20.

<DATELINE>FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday said its second quarter profit jumped 16 percent because of strong performances by the company's plastics, broadcasting and financial services operations. The Fairfield-based company said net earnings totaled $ 835 million, or 93 cents a share, up from $ 720 million, or 79 cents a share originally reported for the the same period a year ago. <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s 1987 quarterly earnings were restated at year-end to reflect adoption of new income tax accounting rules. The company said in a statement that ongoing operations are not affected by the change. Sales during the second quarter totaled $ 9.25 billion, off 3 percent from $ 9.56 billion in the previous quarter when sales of the company's consumer electronics businesses were included. GE-RCA Consumer Electronics, which contributed about $ 3 billion a year in sales, was sold to <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> late last year. `` With these results, <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> is well on its way to a second consecutive full year of strong double-digit increases in earnings,'' said <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> also said that since the last earnings report, the company has forged several important agreements, one with labor and two to expand the plastics business On Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s largest union, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, overwhelmingly ratified a new three-year national contract.

<HEAD>Asbestos Defendant Files Reorganization Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> UNR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> filed a reorganization plan Thursday to settle nearly $ 113 million in debts and about 90,000 personal-injury claims stemming from exposure to its asbestos products. Under the plan, all creditors and health claimants would become shareholders in the Chicago-based steel-tubing maker, which stopped manufacturing asbestos pipe insulation in 1962. The plan calls for business creditors to exchange their $ 112.7 million in claims for 28 percent of the stock in the restructured company, which will have equity in excess of $ 190 million, according to <ORGANIZATION> UNR </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaynor </PERSON>. Personal-injury claimants would receive 64 percent of the common stock of the restructured company and current shareholders would receive 8 percent, <PERSON> Gaynor </PERSON> said. Current shareholders also would receive the right to purchase enough stock, at $ 5.15 per share, to double their holdings during the next six years, he said. Asbestos, commonly used as an insulating material until the early 1960s, can cause a range of respiratory ailments when its fibers are inhaled. Most of the health claims were filed by shipyard workers who said their contact with <ORGANIZATION> UNR </ORGANIZATION>'s asbestos pipe insulation had caused them to develop health problems, <PERSON> Gaynor </PERSON> said. Stock earmarked for the claimants would be placed in a pool to be divided among all current and future claimants, he said. `` Out of that fund will come the cost of determining who it will go to,'' <PERSON> Gaynor </PERSON> said. `` We're saying, ` Here's a block of stock. It's your problem to divide it up at your expense.''' He said the plan was endorsed by representatives of <ORGANIZATION> UNR </ORGANIZATION>'s largest creditors and the personal-injury claimants Creditors and claimants still must vote on the plan, although no date for the vote has been set, <PERSON> Gaynor </PERSON> said. He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, the court-appointed examiner in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> case, also had endorsed the plan. <ORGANIZATION> UNR </ORGANIZATION> filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Code in 1982 after the cost of defending itself against asbestos-related personal-injury claims contributed to a second-quarter loss of $ 8.9 million. <ORGANIZATION> UNR </ORGANIZATION>, a holding company consisting of <ORGANIZATION> Unarco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> UNR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> UNR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, reported a profit of nearly $ 1.9 million for the first quarter of 1988.

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s largest union, representing 40,000 workers, overwhelmingly ratified a new contract and 11 smaller unions were expected to follow suit, labor leaders said Thursday. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> voted nearly 5-to-1 in favor of the three-year pact with all but two of the 72 locals reporting, union spokesman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Borstel </PERSON>.

Sixty-six locals approved the pact, three rejected it, and one local split evenly. The vote was 33,378 to 6,785 to approve the pact, he said. `` The overwhelming vote to ratify shows that the <ORGANIZATION> IUE </ORGANIZATION> membership is satisfied with this settlement, which is worth more than the 1985 contract and is better than any other agreement negotiated in industry this year,'' said <ORGANIZATION> IUE </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bywater </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bywater </PERSON> said he expected the 11 smaller unions that joined the <ORGANIZATION> IUE </ORGANIZATION> at the bargaining table to ratify the contract. The tentative agreement, reached June 26, calls for a special early retirement package; three annual wage increases of 2.5 percent, 1.5 percent and 1.5 percent; two cash bonuses; reduced employee pension contributions; preferential hiring for <ORGANIZATION> IUE </ORGANIZATION> members; dependent care aid, and other improvements. The average hourly wage of $ 12.02 would rise to $ 13.40, assuming 4.5 percent annual inflation, according to GE figures. The average employee stands to gain about $ 6,100 over the life of the contract. Workers covered by the pact produce everything from light bulbs to appliances, medical equipment to aerospace products, and maintain factories and machinery. Each union must ratify the pact by Sunday for its terms to be retroactive, <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Batty </PERSON> said.

 Reading & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Bates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced Thursday it will sell its oil and gas subsidiary and move its corporate headquarters to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, where it will concentrate on offshore drilling. About 30 employees were laid off Thursday, and another 100 will lose their jobs in the next few months, officials said. The company has about 2,000 employees worldwide. J.W. <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, said the move to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Another subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Reading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drilling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has maintained offices in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> for more than 30 years. `` Obviously, the decision has been a very difficult one,'' said <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>, who helped start the company in 1955. But he said it is necessary because there has been no turnaround for the oil industry. Reading & amp; <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> has had three years of losses and a fourth is anticipated, he said. `` I think there's no question it'll get better,'' <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> said. `` The question is, when. If the company is to survive as a major international offshore drilling contractor, which has been our principal business throughout the years, we have no alternative.'' Reading & amp; <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> operates a fleet of 18 offshore drilling rigs throughout the world. The company also owns <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a process engineering company located in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Reading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> operating in eastern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. Reading & amp; <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> disposed of its pipeline construction business in 1985. In 1987, the company completed sale of its foreign oil and gas production, its horizontal drilling operations and its part of a land drilling venture in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. It reported losses of $ 191 million, in 1987, $ 145.8 million in 1986 and $ 190.6 million in 1985. The company is in default of all leases, subject to continuing negotiations, in an amount estimated at $ 272.2 million as of Dec. 31, 1987. The company and its lenders are continuing to negotiate terms of a restructuring agreement, <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> said. `` Hopefully, that will be accomplished by the end of the year, or certainly next year,'' he said. <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> said he does not believe the company will have any trouble finding a buyer for the petroleum company. Reading & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Bates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> had operating revenues of about $ 25 million in 1987, and proved developed reserves in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> of 5.7 million barrels of oil and 70 billion cubic feet of natural gas. `` There is intense interest in acquiring reserves,'' <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday backed off from recommending legislation that would guarantee investors the right to sue their stock broker in court. The commission had been considering asking <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to outlaw clauses in brokerage account agreements requiring customers to settle disputes through industry-sponsored arbitration panels, rather than through the courts. But, by a 5-0 vote, the commission decided instead to ask stock exchanges and other organizations that run arbitration systems to study the matter and report back by Oct. 15. Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee with jurisdiction over the securities markets, said the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> had caved in to industry lobbying with its decision `` Apparently there was a full-court press by the industry that was successful,'' <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> said. `` ... I think the industry stared into the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s eyes on this issue and the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> blinked.'' When the commission discussed the arbitration clauses last month, the legislative recommendation looked headed for approval. It was supported by <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> and member <PERSON> Aulana </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>. Commissioner <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said he was inclined to favor it but wanted to hear from securities firms, which strongly opposed banning the clauses. But, on Thursday, <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> retreated from his earlier support. He said he was persuaded to defer action after learning the industry would at least favor disclosure notices to customers explaining the meaning of the clauses. An <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> survey found that 39 percent of cash accounts carry arbitration agreements and that firms holding another 40 percent were considering using such clauses. But <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said many firms that were once looking into using the clauses for cash accounts appear to be holding off at least for now. He also said some regional firms have recently made a point of advertising that they will open cash accounts without arbitration clauses. However, nearly all firms surveyed, 95 percent, require arbitration agreements for option and margin accounts, where the risk of loss is greater. Proponents of the clauses argue that customers are free to negotiate the clauses out of the contract and that firms have a right to set the conditions under which they're willing to do business. Administration officials, including <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>, had sent letters to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> criticizing staff proposals on arbitration clauses. Despite the lack of <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> support, Reps. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>, D-Va.; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., have introduced The bill is backed by state securities regulators and others who say arbitration clauses are unfair because they require customers to sign away their right to sue before they know the nature of any disagreement that may arise. The head of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents state regulators, called the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> decision `` disappointing.'' `` If the commission's mistake goes uncorrected, investors will end up having only those rights which the securities industry chooses to give them. ... Small investors will see the commission failure to act as another sign that the deck is stacked against them,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, president of the association and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>'s top securities regulator. <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON>, however, said, `` I want to make it clear that -LRB- this -RRB- ... is not a decision to de-emphasize consumer interest in the securities industry.''

 A former secretary to Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> was added Thursday to the list of aides to top politicians who reportedly profited from questionable stock dealings in a scandal sweeping Japanese business and politics. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> told reporters that his former secretary, <PERSON> Ihei </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON>, earned profits by trading the shares of the real estate company <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION>. He said <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON> obtained shares from the company and then sold them shortly after Recruit-Cosmos went public in October 1986, when <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> was finance minister. In related developments, the president of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s leading economic newspaper and the chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> resigned. The chairman of Recruit-Cosmos and its parent company also announced he will step down. The dealings were not illegal, but critics said the case illustrates doubtful ethics in the links between <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s politicians and businessmen <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> did not elaborate on the number of shares <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON> traded or his profits from the deal, and refused to take responsibility for his former aide's action. But <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> acknowledged that the scandal would seriously affect an upcoming session of the Diet, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s parliament, when the administration hopes to push through a major tax reform measure. The controversy surfaced last month as a bribery case in a local government, but entered a new phase with revelations that aides to leaders of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> profited with <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> stock. In addition to <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, the scandal has affected secretaries of Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON>, former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General and former Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Abe </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> Director General <PERSON> Koichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kato </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Michio </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON>, the former minister of international trade and industry.. Of them, only <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> has denied knowing of the stock deals The others said they had become aware their aides had received the stock and made profits. `` This involves the most senior -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- officials, and there is going to be a major outcry from the Japanese people,'' said <PERSON> Shigeru </PERSON> <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, a leader of the main opposition <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` Although they broke no law, they abused their positions to line their pockets.'' <PERSON> Saburo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsukamoto </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the third largest opposition party, also was found on the list of 76 people who reportedly profited from the transactions. According to Japanese press reports, Recruit-Cosmos gave or sold stock at an artificially low price to high-ranking politicians. In some instances, the company reportedly lent money to politicians to buy the shares. When the company went public in October 1986 and the stock price soared, the politicians were able to reap large profits, the reports said. It was not clear what, if anything, the politicians did for <PERSON> Recruit-Cosmos </PERSON> in return. `` Whether they are politicians or company heads, those who have responsibilities must behave prudently, not to be criticized by the general public,'' Chief Cabinet Secretary <PERSON> Keizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Obuchi </PERSON> said in the only official comment from the government on the matter. Not only politicians are involved in the scandal. <PERSON> Ko </PERSON> <PERSON> Morita </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s leading economic daily, <ORGANIZATION> Nihon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Keizai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, resigned Wednesday after it was revealed that he had dealt in <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> shares, violating the rules of his newspaper. <PERSON> Hiromasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> and its parent company <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a giant information service firm, also announced that he will resign the two chairmanships. The president of Recruit, <PERSON> Naotaka </PERSON> <PERSON> Ida </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON> will also withdraw from the government's tax commission. `` Politicians want as much money as they can get, and businessmen always look for connections with politicians,'' said an editorial in <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, the newspaper that broke the story. The controversy is the latest in a series of scandals to rock <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s long-dominant <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Six people have been indicted since May for allegedly arranging bribes by advertising agencies to gain public relations contracts with the prime minister's office. Last month, five executives of a <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> electronics firm who made large donations to both the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Socialist parties were arrested for evading income taxes of $ 12 million, earned from illegal stocks manipulation. Former Prime Minister <PERSON> Kakuei </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON> was found guilty in 1983 of accepting bribes from the <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but he remained an important force in Japanese politics until he suffered a stroke in 1985. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s faction within the ruling party is made up mainly of former <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON> followers.

<HEAD>Jury Finds For ESM In Civil Lawsuit Against Warner</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal jury on Thursday awarded $ 22.6 million to the estate of now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> ESM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, ruling against financier <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, whom the firm claimed had unjustly profited from its 1985 failure. The jury deliberated seven hours before ruling in favor of <ORGANIZATION> ESM </ORGANIZATION> on civil complaints in the lawsuit accusing <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> of fraudulently taking money out of the troubled securities firm when he knew the firm was in dire financial trouble, of profiting from insider information, and of loaning <ORGANIZATION> ESM </ORGANIZATION> money in exchange for profits on bogus financial transactions. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s Cincinnati-based thrift, <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, was <ORGANIZATION> ESM </ORGANIZATION>'s biggest customer. Home State collapsed shortly after <ORGANIZATION> ESM </ORGANIZATION> failed in 1985, triggering a savings and loan panic in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, 69, said he would appeal. He was visibly upset when he heard the verdict and said: `` The jury has spoken. I'm stunned. Terribly.'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s attorney, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, said it was `` clearly a decision based on court passion. Clearly the jury did not understand what this case was about.'' District Judge <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> had given the jury 22 questions to consider and they ruled in favor of <ORGANIZATION> ESM </ORGANIZATION> Trustee <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tew </PERSON> on every question, including the amounts requested by the plaintiffs. The lawsuit also had claimed <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> violated securities, racketeering and civil theft statutes and that he unjustly profited from <ORGANIZATION> ESM </ORGANIZATION>'s 1985 failure. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> won a strategic victory just before the start of deliberations Wednesday when <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> determined the plaintiff had not proven <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> was involved in securities fraud. But in Thursday's verdict, the jury found that he `` actually participated in the fraudulent purpose'' of <ORGANIZATION> ESM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. Although he dismissed the fraud counts, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> did not change the amount of damages that could be sought. The judge earlier reduced the damages sought from $ 62 million to $ 22 million. Before the verdict, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said: `` Regardless of the financial outcome, what that judge did vindicated me.'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> last year was acquitted of federal criminal charges but convicted of state charges in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and sentenced to three years in connection with the collapse of Home State. He is free while appealing that conviction. Much of the blame for the thrift's problems was placed on <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, who held a personal account at <ORGANIZATION> ESM </ORGANIZATION> and had encouraged Home State to invest with the obscure <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> firm. <PERSON> Tew </PERSON>'s lawyers claimed <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> was an insider at <ORGANIZATION> ESM </ORGANIZATION> who demanded and was given special treatment because of Home State's huge investments with <ORGANIZATION> ESM </ORGANIZATION>. Before the verdict, <PERSON> Tew </PERSON> said he was disappointed by the dismissal of the fraud counts but that the damage to his suit was minimal. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said the dismissal of the four fraud counts supported his claim that <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> was a victim, and not a perpetrator, of fraud at <ORGANIZATION> ESM </ORGANIZATION>. `` The largest single victim of <ORGANIZATION> ESM </ORGANIZATION>'s fraud is <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said in closing arguments. `` If you are a victim, how can you be an insider.'' As evidence, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> repeatedly reminded jurors that <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> continued to invest money and real estate with <ORGANIZATION> ESM </ORGANIZATION> after allegedly learning of the firm's troubles. But <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia-Pedrosa </PERSON>, the attorney for <PERSON> Tew </PERSON>, argued that <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> had to keep investing in <ORGANIZATION> ESM </ORGANIZATION> because <ORGANIZATION> ESM </ORGANIZATION> and Home State were dependent on each other for survival.

<TEXT>
 Sun Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors on Thursday approved a major restructuring plan that will spin off the company's $ 4.8 billion domestic oil and gas exploration and production business into an independent company and trim its work force by more than 1,000 The plan also calls for the nation's 10th largest oil company to expand its international exploration and production operations, as well as its refining and marketing business, which will be retained by the restructured Sun, company officials said. It comes two days after <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> announced it had agreed to buy <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a Northeast refiner and retailer, for $ 513 million from oil trader <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Duess </PERSON>. The reorganization is projected as a major-cost savings move for the Radnor-based company, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Waitneight </PERSON>, vice president of corporate financing. `` The earnings have not been growing in the rather weak market for crude oil and natural gas,'' <PERSON> Waitneight </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. He said company officials believe that payroll reductions and independent management structures for the separate companies would result in higher earnings that would boost profits. Under the plan, current <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> shareholders would receive a one-for-one tax-free distribution of stock in the newly created <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exploration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which will handle domestic oil and gas exploration and production. The redistribution is subject to approval by shareholders and dependent on the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> granting it tax-free status. The new company, to be headquartered in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, would become the largest independent oil and gas producer in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, with approximately $ 4.8 billion in assets and $ 1.6 billion in revenue in 1987, Sun officials said. The original Sun would restructure with more than $ 9 billion in assets. Excluding the domestic oil and gas exploration and production business, Sun totaled $ 9.1 billion in revenue last year. <PERSON> Waitneight </PERSON> said the distribution would be presented for shareholders' consideration during a special meeting in early October, with distribution of shares, if approved, planned for the end of October. Reduction of the work force will begin immediately, <PERSON> Waitneight </PERSON> said. About 800 Sun workers employed in the new company's operations, most of them in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, will lose their jobs, <PERSON> Waitneight </PERSON> said. Another 250 workers at the restructured Sun, most of them in the East and many in the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> area, also will lose their jobs, he said. Company officials said some employees would be offered early retirment incentives, but <PERSON> Waitneight </PERSON> would not specify how many. Sun officials expect the restructuring to produce $ 65 million in after-tax savings for <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> E </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P each year and $ 15 million for the restructured Sun each year, most of that through payroll reductions. `` The driving force behind this decision is to enhance value for holders of <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> stock,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McClements </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of Sun. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauptfuhrer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sun </PERSON>'s president and chief operating officer, was named by the Sun board as the chairman and chief executive officer of the newly created <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> E </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>, who heads the company's exploration and production operations, will become the president and chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> E </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> has more than 20,000 employees in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and eight other countries. It has refineries in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and mines coal in five states.

The <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> purchase also includes 30 oil terminals owned by <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> plus its 986-mile products pipeline system from its refinery to <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tonawanda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> Sun reported revenue of $ 2.39 billion in the first quarter of 1988, compared to $ 2.26 billion in the first quarter of 1987. Net income for the first quarter of 1988 was $ 60 million or $ .57 per share of common stock, a 58 percent increase from the $ 38 million or $ .35 per share of common stock in the first quarter of 1987.

 A 17-story tower will be built to house the growing <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>, board Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paley </PERSON> announced Thursday. `` This wonderful new building gives the museum the space it needs,'' said <PERSON> Paley </PERSON>, founder of CBS. `` It dramatically marks the museum's coming of age.'' <PERSON> Paley </PERSON> said he hopes the extra space can double the 100,000 people a year now drawn to the 12-year-old museum, whose 37-member board includes <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Alda </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Bochco </PERSON>, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lear </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinker </PERSON>. The groundbreaking on a vacant lot on West 52nd Street, next door to the 21 Club, is planned for September. Construction should take two years. The building, by design consultant <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and architect <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgee </PERSON>, features a two-story arch at the sidewalk and a set-back tower. <PERSON> Burgee </PERSON> noted that a museum building must be designed as `` a civic monument, a dignified place ... and it has to be timeless, because it's forever and ever.'' The plans include 200-seat and 90-seat theaters; a screening room and classroom; a radio listening room; a library with card catalogs of programs and scripts; and galleries. The archives already house cassettes of 30,000 programs. Radio buffs can hear President <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>'s Fireside Chats, <PERSON> Gracie </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, or <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON>'s Prairie Home Companion. TV devotees can revel in `` I Love <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>,'' `` Roots,'' `` <PERSON> Cagney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON>'' _ or even their favorite commercials. About two-thirds of the estimated $ 45 million cost has been met _ including <PERSON> Paley </PERSON>'s contribution, a $ 12 million parcel of land. The top four floors will be rented out to businesses to help defray operating costs, said <PERSON> Paley </PERSON>. He said he also will lease the old museum building as offices once the new one is finished.

 The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has turned to a federal court in an effort to thwart challenges to a contract it arranged with <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> computer billionaire <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Perot </PERSON>. At stake is a potentially multimillion-dollar contract to study ways to improve postal efficiency. The deal is being challenged by would-be competitors who did n't get to bid They have asked the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contract </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> to order suspension of the agreement, and the board complied Thursday, ordering a temporary freeze on the contract The <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> to rule that the contract board does n't have jurisdiction in the case The <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> contends that it is exempt from the federal procurement law that calls for the <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> to arrange most government purchases of data processing services and equipment. That argument did n't wash with the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contract </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, however, which declined to drop the case on jurisdictional grounds. In a separate case last April, the board concluded that it did have jurisdiction over the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and said that agency is indeed bound by the procurement rules. Postal officials, insisting that they are not covered by the law, declined Tuesday to provide documents or individuals to testify before the board. The <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agreed that it did not follow provisions of the law, saying that that was because it has its own purchasing rules, which were followed. The deal is being challenged by <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Perot </PERSON>'s former company and now a part of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and by <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> McLean </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The contract is in two phases. The first is a $ 500,000 agreement calling for <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> to analyze postal operations and recommend ways to save money. It was announced June 2 and immediately drew criticism from a variety of sources. After the first 90-day phase, there is to be a second part, in which <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> would be paid a percentage of any savings the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> realized from implementing his recommendations for ways of improving its systems and procedures. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, has requested the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> to investigate terms of the deal, and directed the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to delay the second phase in the meantime.
