<TEXT>
 Organizers of a rodeo for homosexuals on Friday accused officials of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nevada-Reno </ORGANIZATION> officials of bowing to public pressure and using a contract dispute to cancel the contest. In August, the university's <ORGANIZATION> Lawlor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Events </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> canceled the contract to rent out its stadium Oct. 21-23 for the international championship gay rodeo, in which top riders from regional gay rodeos compete. `` I think it is just an excuse on the part of <LOCATION> Lawlor </LOCATION> to prevent these types of events from coming to the facility,'' attorney <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumpter </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Washoe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Klasic </PERSON>, general counsel for the university and <PERSON> Lawlor </PERSON>, denied the charge, telling the judge, `` It has always been a contract action. This is not a civil rights action.'' On Sept. 1, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rodeo </ORGANIZATION> and the Silver State Gay Rodeo associations sued <ORGANIZATION> UNR </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the events center on its campus. The associations are seeking an injuction from Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Forman </PERSON> to force <PERSON> Lawlor </PERSON> to rent its stadium for the gay rodeo, which has been advertised for several months throughout the world. <PERSON> Forman </PERSON> said he would rule on the injuction Monday. <PERSON> Klasic </PERSON> told the court the contract was canceled by <PERSON> Lawlor </PERSON> after Aug. 15 when the gay organization failed to come up with $ 9,000 in pre-payments to cover expenses for security, parking, cleanup and other operation costs. He said <PERSON> Lawlor </PERSON> became concerned about the organization's ability to pay expenses so a prepayment schedule was orally agreed to in June. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Krambeal </PERSON>, president of the international association, said he only agreed to the demands because he feared <PERSON> Lawlor </PERSON> otherwise would cancel the event. His organization paid $ 2,263 in prepayments before running out of money. During initial contract talks in October 1987 and when the document was signed in February 1988, <PERSON> Krambeal </PERSON> said he was told expenses would not be due until Oct. 23. <PERSON> Sumpter </PERSON> said the written contract did not call for any prepayments. Instead, it only required that $ 7,300 be paid up front to rent out the stadium, which was done, he said. <PERSON> Sumpter </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lawlor </PERSON> used the financial concern as a way to cause the association to violate its contract because of negative complaints from area residents who protested similar events held in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The prepayment plan was decided only after news leaked that a gay rodeo was returning to <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> and two local business groups told <PERSON> Lawlor </PERSON> officials that previous gay rodeo organizations did n't pay all their bills, he said.

 Left-wing guerrillas firing automatic weapons burst into a federal court building in the town of <LOCATION> Buga </LOCATION> Friday and freed five of their comrades being held for trial, police reported. They said a judge's administrative assistant was taken hostage by the gunmen and his body was found with a bullet in the head beside a highway near the town 160 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. Two of the guerrillas freed by the attackers were captured after an hour-long pursuit, the police said. They did not report any other casualties or give further details. In other developments, leftist rebels freed 22 government soldiers and policemen captured in a raid last month and also released two Colombian geologists seized in another attack, the government and military announced. The soldiers and policemen freed Friday had been taken prisoner Aug. 23 by guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> during a joint attack on the northwestern town of <LOCATION> Saiza </LOCATION>. A statement from the office of President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcos </PERSON> said a one-day cease-fire had been arranged so the captives could be released in the <LOCATION> Uraba </LOCATION> region, about 300 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. Two of the government troopers had been wounded in the rocket and mortar attack on the police station in <LOCATION> Saiza </LOCATION>, Gen. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said in an interview with the radio station <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION>. He did not list their conditions or elaborate. The two geologists released Thursday were among five who worked with coal companies and were kidnapped Aug. 20 by rebels of another guerrilla group, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, or ELN. Rebels freed the two geologists in an arranged meeting with a group of reporters in the city of <LOCATION> Bucaramanga </LOCATION>, 200 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. An <ORGANIZATION> ELN </ORGANIZATION> communique said the three other geologists would be released soon, but declared the guerrillas would launch an offensive against foreign coal-mining companies. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> state company <ORGANIZATION> Carbacol </ORGANIZATION> are partners in a $ 3 billion surface mine near <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> coast. <ORGANIZATION> ELN </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas have attacked oil pipelines and oil installations operated by <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> state company <ORGANIZATION> Ecopetrol </ORGANIZATION> 46 times this year, according to the government. It placed the damage at $ 300 million. A <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> communique released Friday said 1,174 people have been killed this year in guerrilla attacks and battles between rebels and security forces. It listed the slain as 499 guerrillas, 378 civilians and 297 policemen and soldiers. The ministry has reported 2,037 people were killed last year in fighting involving rebels, government forces and civilians caught in the violence.

In his scene, <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> allegedly bites the heads off two mice and spits them into the audience. According to <PERSON> Hon </PERSON>, the scene has outraged animal rights activists, including television game show host <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> has been very keen for us to arrest this guy <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> so legislators can see exactly what's going on,'' said <PERSON> Hon </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Administration Cool To Soviet Offer On Bases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is reacting coolly to new Soviet proposals aimed at removing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> objections to a large radar facility in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Friday the administration continues to insist that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> dismantle the huge installation at <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say the facility violates the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. There is little administration interest in a Soviet offer to allow <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials to inspect the facility or a separate proposal to convert it into an international space center, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> indicated. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials took a mostly cautious stance in response to several initiatives that Soviet General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> announced Friday in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> _ steps that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said would improve world security. Among <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proposals was an offer to dismantle a large Soviet naval base at <LOCATION> Cam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in exchange for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> willingness to close military installations in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told reporters he had not had time to study the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> proposal fully, saying, `` I look forward to doing that because we certainly want to do anything we can to help bring about a better relationship between our two countries.'' But in a reference to the pitfalls of card-playing, he said, `` As I have frequently said to him -LRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> -RRB-, ` Trust everybody, but cut the cards.''' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> voiced skepticism earlier, saying, `` We're somewhat pessimistic.'' `` It just does n't seem to make sense on the face of it,'' the spokesman said when asked about <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s base-closing proposal. `` But, on the other hand,'' he said, `` we want to give a full analysis to the speech to that proposal, and the context of what was said. ... I do n't want to elaborate. We'll wait for a more detailed analysis.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also proposed creation of an international center on the peaceful use of outer space at the Siberian radar station, according to the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. It appeared he was proposing the elimination or conversion of the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar installation, which the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government claims violates the 1972 ABM treaty. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said `` there was some mention'' of allowing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspectors into <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> during a recent superpower review of the ABM treaty in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, and he said, `` We essentially reject that idea.'' `` Our demand has always been that <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> be dismantled as a violation of the ABM treaty and we still believe that to be the case,'' he said. `` To allow inspections or personnel to view their equipment and so forth, or to turn it into a space station or a drive-in movie theater, or anything else, simply does not respond to the need to dismantle what is a violation of the treaty,'' the spokesman said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintains that the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> facility violates provisions of the ABM treaty prohibiting the deployment of large radar stations capable of giving early missile attack warnings unless such facilities are stationed on the periphery of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> or Soviet territory. The Soviets have argued that the facility's function is to follow objects in outer space. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> got some support from <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 81-0 to support the administration's contention that the giant Soviet radar system violates the treaty. `` These violations are a threat to the security of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., author of the resolution The non-binding resolution said the radar station question should be settled before there are any new U.S.-Soviet agreements on limiting strategic, or long-range, atomic weapons. The two sides are now negotiating toward a 50 percent reduction in such arms. The resolution also urged <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to develop `` appropriate, proportionate response options'' to the Soviet radar station. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters at the daily <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> news briefing that the administration was not yet prepared to declare <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> a `` material breach'' of the treaty _ a step that effectively would serve notice of American withdrawal from the ABM pact. `` I frankly think it's unlikely that there would be any change in our present position'' against a breakout from the treaty, he said.

<TEXT>
 The much-delayed launch of the shuttle Discovery for the first manned space mission since the 1986 Challenger disaster has been set by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> for Sept. 29. A three hour launch `` window'' from the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> opens at 9:59 a.m. EDT. `` I'm delighted to have reached this point,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Truly </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> flight chief, in making the announcement Friday. `` My hat is off to all members of the shuttle team whose tireless efforts have brought us here to the brink of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s return to manned space.'' The date was set after Truly decided that Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> would not disrupt operations at the <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, home of <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> for shuttle flights. `` No threat to <ORGANIZATION> JSC </ORGANIZATION> facilities is projected if <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> continues on its current path,'' the announcement said. The first flight in 32 months will be a four-day, one hour mission to deploy a huge <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> communications satellite. Discovery is to land at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base in the <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> on Oct. 3, if the launch goes as scheduled. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> will command the five-man flight, all of whom have been on previous missions. The crewmen are <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> O </PERSON>. <PERSON> Covey </PERSON>, the pilot, and mission specialists <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lounge </PERSON> and Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilmers </PERSON>. The shuttle was cleared for flight Wednesday after a two-day review of the shuttle's systems and the readiness of launch and flight control teams at the launch site. The $ 100 million Tracking and Data Relay Satellite that the astronauts will carry into orbit is a twin of one lost in the Challenger explosion Jan. 28, 1986. It is needed to complete a communications system that eventually will replace all ground-to-air links with the space shuttle and a number of satellites. They will also conduct 11 science and technology experiments and check out hundreds of design changes made to the shuttle. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> had hoped to return to manned space flight sooner with the 26th shuttle mission, designated as STS-26. But five announced launch dates had to be scrubbed because of technical problems involved in the $ 1.2 billion redesign. There were 56 major changes and more than 400 lesser ones; the orbiter alone received 210 fixes. The most extensive changes were made to solid fuel rockets that provide more than 70 percent of the power to propel the shuttle into orbit. The Challenger explosion, which claimed the lives of seven astronauts including schoolteacher <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON>, was caused by a leak in one booster that allowed a plume of flame to reach the fuel tank. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> grounded the shuttles following the explosion. One major change implemented is an escape system designed for use if the shuttle has to ditch in the ocean. It has been installed in Discovery and will be put into the two other shuttles remaining in the fleet. A replacement for Challenger is being built and should be ready for flight in 1990.

 A joint U.S.-Vietnamese team soon will begin an on-site investigation into the fate of missing <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> servicemen, focussing on seven cases in which there is evidence the victims were alive when they disappeared. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said Friday the seven are part of the 70 `` most compelling cases'' which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials raised with Vietnamese authorities last year. Other officials said that although the 70 were presumed to be alive when they became separated from their units, all have long since been presumed dead because there is no evidence to prove otherwise. This is the first time the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> have agreed on a joint investigation involving more than one site. Officials from the two countries participated in the excavation of a crash site in search of missing servicemen in November 1985. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, commander of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Joint Casualty Resolution Center, said in a telephone interview Friday from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, `` We're going to do joint investigations of incidents, not just crash sites, but places where people were last thought to be but we do n't know exactly what happened to them. `` I think it's a very significant development,'' he said. `` We think this will be the first of many such joint activities.'' The inspections will be concentrated in an area north of <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>. On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> urged the families of missing servicemen to ignore the rumors that will be inevitable during the pending search. `` We have to continue to press for an accounting of each and every one, even though the prospects of finding anyone alive diminish with the passing of time,'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> told a crowd of several hundred at a National POW-MIA Recognition Day ceremony on the steps of the Capitol. All told, more than 1,700 Americans remain unaccounted for in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> since <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military involvement in the country ended 15 years ago. There is no firm evidence that any are alive although officials routinely check out reports of live sightings. The two countries reached agreement on an on-site inspection procedure during a meeting in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> that ended Wednesday, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. The investigation will involve interviews with villagers and other activities. A 90-day period, beginning Sept. 1, was set aside for carrying out the investigations, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, with each one limited to 10 days. After suspending cooperation with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on the MIA issue in August, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> recently agreed to resume discussions on the issue. The suspension was precipitated by <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s unhappiness with the administration's policy of keeping <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> isolated diplomatically and economically until that country withdraws its troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is one of the few countries with which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not have diplomatic relations. While restoring cooperation on the MIA question, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has not lifted a ban on discussions about a program to permit thousands of former political prisoners to emigrate to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has approved in principle its first change in <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> convoy procedures as a result of the Iran-Iraq cease-fire, defense officials say. Assuming the changes are finalized, U.S.-flag tankers in the waterway will be kept within a `` defensive zone'' by American warships and always under surveillance, but wo n't be accompanied every step of the way as is now the case, the sources said. `` The best way to describe it is in basketball terms, by saying you're going from a man-to-man defense to a zone defense,'' said one official. The change will allow only a slight reduction in the number of warships deployed to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> _ probably one fewer ship _ but will increase the flexibility of the task force commander and allow the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s ships to operate at a lesser alert level, the officials added. The sources, who agreed to discuss the matter only if not identified, said the change in procedure had been tentatively approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, but would not be ordered until allies with warships in the region and certain <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> countries were consulted. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> declined to discuss details of the plan on Friday but acknowledged in a statement: `` The administration is considering additional steps which ... -LRB- could be described as -RRB- modest modifications of our present method of providing protection to U.S.-flagged shipping in the gulf. `` The modifications currently under consideration do not involve any significant reduction in force levels. We are continuing to consult with our friends and allies.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has 26 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships assigned to its Joint Task Force <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, including 17 inside the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> itself. As of Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had conducted 85 convoy operations since the summer of 1987, when the escorts began. With the exception of the departure of one cruiser, the <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vincennes </ORGANIZATION>, the naval force has not changed in size despite last month's end to hostilities between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> has said repeatedly the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not reduce its military presence in the region until it is absolutely convinced the cease-fire will hold and that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> merchant ships are n't threatened. According to the sources, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> has approved the idea of `` providing flexibility'' to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> on convoys. `` You keep your warships nearby, always close enough to act, but drop the continuous, side-by-side presence,'' explained one source. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vessels deploy in what amounts to a picket line up and down the gulf, ready to pick up a merchant as it moves within a particular range,'' said another. The sources said the plan called for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to directly escort merchants through the narrow <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, the sole entrance to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, but to use the picket-line approach for the remainder of the trip. `` This is the first important response to the cease-fire,'' said one source. `` If this works out OK, then we can consider additional steps.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> mounted its escort operations in 1987 after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> approved a request by <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> to reflag 11 of its tankers under the American flag. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, a key ally of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the 8-year-old war, had seen its ships become a special target of Iranian forces and wanted to obtain <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military protection. For more than 40 years before the escorts, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s normal <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> presence consisted of four to six ships.

<HEAD>Airlines Ordered To Check Takeoff Warning Alarms On All Boeing 727
Jets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Airlines have been ordered by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to check takeoff warning alarms on all <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 jetliners because of questions raised in the investigation of a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> crash last month. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials said Friday the directive to the airlines for a one-time check of the estimated 1,200 727 jets in domestic operation was `` purely precautionary.'' There is no evidence that the alarm, which warns of a false flap setting, malfunctioned in the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> plane that crashed Aug. 31 at the <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> airport, killing 14 of the 108 people aboard, the officials said. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s associate administrator for regulation and certification, said checking the alarms on all <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727s was `` not anything other than our own effort to gather data.'' `` It should n't be read that we have any indication that the flaps were involved in the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- accident,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Reese </PERSON> said the company was unaware of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> order. She added that the order is not an unusual action. <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> said the action was taken because there have been `` a lot of questions asked'' in connection with the crash and the positioning of the flaps during the takeoff. Investigators have uncovered conflicting evidence as to whether the flaps were positioned properly prior to the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> crash. The federal investigation has not yet determined the cause of the accident. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigators have said that among the areas being examined is whether the flight crew extended the flap setting as required. If the flaps were not extended for takeoff as required, an alarm should have sounded in the Delta's cockpit, but no such alarm could be heard on the cockpit voice recorder tape. An aircraft's wing flaps help the plane gain lift and should have been extended 15 degrees when the Delta jet took off. The lever that controls the flaps in the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> jet was found in a `` retracted'' position and the flaps on the wing also were found retracted. However, the co-pilot was heard on the cockpit voice recorder tape to acknowledge that the flaps had been set at the 15 degree position. One theory being examined is that the flap setting might have been called out, but not set properly. Another theory has been that a crew member might have extended the flaps properly prior to takeoff, but at the last second retracted them in a desperate attempt to reduce drag and keep the plane aloft. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> announced Thursday that an inspection of the three engines of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 found no mechanical failure that could be blamed for the accident.

 Former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> says the changes during his controversial tenure did n't lead to the current <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> investigation of bribery in <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> contracts. `` I am very proud of the achievements made in rebuilding the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> during my tenure. I do not believe the changes that led to that success made the system, by its nature, more susceptible to waste, fraud and abuse,'' he said Friday. <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON>'s appearance before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was his first major public comment since the ongoing investigation became public three months ago. The investigation concerns allegations of bribes from consultants, many of them former <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> employees, to current <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employees to obtain inside information about contracts. Those details could be crucial to winning multimillion dollar contracts. No charges have yet been filed. A key figure of the investigation is <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, the former assistant <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary for research and engineering and a close associate of <LOCATION> Lehman </LOCATION> during their <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> tenure. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> resigned and became a high-priced consultant shortly after <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> quit to take a Wall Street job in April 1987. <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> was a controversial figure during his six-year tenure, often clashing with lawmakers and other critics of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s naval build-up. That buildup was the key component of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s program of large increases in the Pentagon budget. <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> did n't talk about specifics of the investigation and committee members did n't seek those details because they did n't want to harm the probe But he noted the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has more consultants than the other services, chiefly because the service has fewer officers. Some <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> tasks are performed by consultants that in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> would be done by officers, he said. `` Consultants are essential, but we do have too many,'' he added. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> could substantially reduce its reliance on consultants.'' `` I was never comfortable with the dependence on consultants,'' <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> said, adding that his efforts to reduce that dependence were thwarted by unidentified bureaucrats. <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> did endorse a pair of reforms proposed after the investigation became public. One would require consultants to register and the other would direct them to disclose all their contracts to prevent conflicts of interest. <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> strongly defended his running of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, disputing critics who have said the changes he ordered may have fostered a climate which led to the investigation. Those changes include more centralized management and elimination of some layers of bureaucracy. `` With regard to strong centralized policy-making and decentralized execution, I see no way that either principle increases the opportunity for waste, fraud and abuse,'' he said. Overall, said <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON>, the Pentagon should be reorganized to give much more authority for daily decisions to lower-level personnel, rather than top officials. He opposed the creation of a single purchasing `` czar,'' a change proposed by some lawmakers. He proposed that the secretary of defense simply make policy, and turn all other major decisions over to the three services. The staff also should be reduced by half, he said.

<HEAD>House Panel Suggests New Limits On Free Mailings For Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY MASSEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Election-year mass mailings by lawmakers have risen dramatically and prompted leaders of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee to call for new restrictions on how much mail can be sent at taxpayer expense. Four members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, including its Democratic chairman and senior <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> member, said in a letter Friday that increased numbers of taxpayer-paid mailings this year have caused a backlog in their processing and delivery. That could cause some of the mail to arrive at voters' homes during the height of the campaign season in late October, they said. Critics contend that some mailings, particularly newsletters, are little more than government-paid campaign literature intended to promote the re-election of officeholders. Under House rules, members can not send a mass mailing less than 60 days before the date of a primary or general election in which their name appears on the ballot. Mailings must be delivered to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> folding room by that deadline for processing. The lawmakers said that after the cutoff period this month, there were 58 million pieces of mail awaiting processing by the <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distribution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. There were 35.4 million pieces of mail ready for processing at the same point in 1986, 36.7 million in 1984 and 33.3 million in 1982. A temporary second shift of workers was added to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> folding room earlier this year at a cost of nearly $ 500,000, and their employment has been extended through mid-October to help handle the larger volume of mail, the lawmakers said. `` It is essential that additional limitations be considered to prevent this situation from repeating itself to the detriment of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and its members,'' the lawmakers said in their letter. Generally, members are limited to six mass mailings for their districts during a year, but that does not include town meeting notices.

<HEAD>Court Decision Expected Soon On House Auctioning</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge is expected to decide soon whether the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has considered the needs of the homeless before auctioning off about 47,000 foreclosed homes that are owned by the government. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> declined Friday to decide several challenges by the homeless to the federal government's policies, but said he would make his decision as soon as possible after taking the arguments under advisement <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON>, an attorney for homeless advocates, reminded <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> that two temporary restraining orders barring the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> from selling houses in the greater <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> area and in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> expired Friday. <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> replied, `` I would hope they would maintain the status quo.'' Government attorneys told <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> they would have to consult with their clients, but <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> general counsel <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> said later through a spokesman that the housing agency would follow the terms of the restraining order through the end of business next Wednesday. The coalition of advocates for the homeless argued the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> has violated the law by selling its stock of foreclosed single-family homes to the highest bidder without determining whether they could be beneficial to the homeless and low-income people. <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> told <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> that <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> receives 70,000 houses each year _ about 7,000 a month _ but the agency `` can not proceed as if it is simply in the real estate business. They must consider the homeless.'' In a related case, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homeless </ORGANIZATION> also argued that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has defied a congressional mandate to release underused federal property as housing for the nation's homeless. Ms. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Foscarinis </PERSON>, a coalition attorney, said `` there are thousands of properties underutilized which could be used for the homeless.'' She said that of the 12 facilities that have been officially identified as underutilized, only two have been made available to the homeless. `` It's unconscionable - as well as illegal - that federal buildings stand vacant while homeless men, women and children sleep on the streets,'' she said. The suits want the court to order the government agencies to survey their property, determine which is underutilized or no longer needed and make those properties available for the homeless. Government attorney <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> argued that the 1987 homeless act does not apply to single family dwellings `` They want to shut down a program that has been going on for 50 years,'' he said. `` They want to tie up the program.'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, another government lawyer, said all the agencies have complied with the requirements of the provisions of the homeless act.

<HEAD>Republicans Pushing `Training' Wage As Alternative To Kennedy Plan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Republicans are planning to whittle away at Democratic-proposed increases in the $ 3.35 minimum wage for the first time in eight years through a subminimum `` training'' wage _ but not until next week. With many senators taking Friday off to campaign for re-election in their home states, Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, was unwilling to risk a vote on a Democratic measure aimed at killing his proposal for a 80 percent subminimum wage. Under the <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> proposal, employers could pay the `` training'' wage during the first 90 days a worker is on their payroll. Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., the chief author of the mininum wage bill, was ready to vote Friday on his proposal to double the number of student exemptions that employers can now use to pay part-time workers 15 percent below the wage floor _ or $ 2.85 an hour presently <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> called <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s proposal a `` mock training wage,'' saying it would would not give employers any incentive to `` open the door to those who have nothing, who are undereducated and unskilled.'' He said his subminimum training wage advocated by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, R-Ind., could `` create hundreds of thousands of new jobs. With presidential and congressional elections just eight weeks away, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other Republicans have softened their opposition to any increase, but have not said how large it should be. In June, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> offered before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> a proposed raise to $ 4 an hour over two years but coupled it with a subminimum training wage. The measure was never voted on. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, said Friday that a lower training wage, the administration's euphemism for a subminimum rate that it has advocated since 1981, must accompany any increase for him to support it. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> called the Republican proposals a <ORGANIZATION> Trojan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horse </ORGANIZATION>, saying <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s proposal for a $ 4 minimum wage amounts to a 10 percent cut in buying power after taking inflation into account from when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took office. `` And from that miserly floor, he proposes a further cut for all new hires,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` Can this be what <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> means when he talks about a kinder, gentler <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>?'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s bill would raise the minimum wage 40 cents an hour in each of the next three years _ to $ 3.75 in 1989; $ 4.50 in 1990 and $ 4.55 in 1991 _ directly benefitting about 15 million workers now paid less than $ 4.50 an hour. Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said he hoped to get a vote on <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>'s different subminimum proposals next Tuesday and a vote on final passage by the end of next House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will take up and `` likely pass'' it as soon as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> acts.

 Syndicated columnist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> received a setback when a judge refused to dismiss weapons charges against him, ruling that <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> was not authorized to own a handgun he used to wound a teenager trespassing in his backyard. District of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sr. </ORGANIZATION> on Friday also directed that <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s case be heard before a jury in a trial scheduled for Sept. 22. The columnist, an outspoken opponent of ownership and use of handguns, faces one count each of possession of an unregistered weapon and ammunition for the gun. If convicted of both misdemeanor charges, he would face a maximum penalty of two years in jail and a $ 2,000 fine. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, 63, had argued in a pre-trial hearing that the charges should be dismissed because the weapon used in the June 14 shooting had been given to him by his son, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent, who had been told it was not necessary to register the weapon because he was a law enforcement officer. Although <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> concentrated on whether his son was misled by city officials in his efforts to register the weapon, <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> gave greater weight to the question of whether the elder <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> was authorized to possess the gun. The city's far-reaching 1976 handgun ordinance makes clear that `` a valid holder of a registration certificate for a firearm could not lend or give it to another person ... whether that person be a relative or a friend, and whether the purpose was for protection or some other worthy objective,'' <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> concluded. <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> also rejected <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s claim of exemption from the gun control law on the grounds that he uses his home as a business, not just a residence. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 19, of suburban <LOCATION> Chevy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, was wounded in the wrist when <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> caught him and three others taking a swim in his backyard pool. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> says he shot <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> when the teen-ager lunged at him, but <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he was shot while trying to flee.

<HEAD>Sessions Acknowledges Contacts With Salvadoran National Guard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> has acknowledged contact between between a bureau intelligence source and the <ORGANIZATION> Salvadoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. But in comments to a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee Friday, Sessions said it will be impossible to determine whether the source gave the Guard sensitive information from <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> files. Critics of the Salvadoran government claim links between the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and right-wing death squad killings in the Central American country. Salvadoran political leaders reject the allegations. Sessions told the subcommittee hearing on the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in Solidarity with the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION> that there were `` communications'' between former bureau intelligence source <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Varelli </PERSON> and the Guard `` I do not know specifically what he gave to the <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>,'' Sessions said. `` We have no way of establishing that.'' He said it was possible <PERSON> Varelli </PERSON> passed along sensitive information. It was disclosed last year that <PERSON> Varelli </PERSON>, who is suing the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> for back pay, had given congressional investigators a list of 13 Salvadorans facing deportation from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in February 1987 that he had gotten the list from <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Agent <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, and he passed it along to the <ORGANIZATION> Salvadoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON> subsequently resigned from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif., suggested <PERSON> Varelli </PERSON> may have had access to other such lists as well `` It is quite possible,'' Sessions responded in testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights, which <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> chairs. Sessions noted that the bureau took action to ensure that the 13 Salvadorans `` were in fact informed'' their names had turned up on the list. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> early in 1987 rejected a suggestion by <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, based on information from <LOCATION> Varelli </LOCATION>, that the bureau was trading information with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Revell </PERSON>, executive assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, said at the time that such a suggestion `` is not true.'' Based on information supplied by <PERSON> Varelli </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> launched a terrorism probe of <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> in March 1983. Sessions disciplined half a dozen bureau personnel Wednesday for negligence in the investigation. He said the bureau failed initially to check out <PERSON> Varelli </PERSON>'s unreliable background and that the bureau broadened the probe unnecessarily in October 1983 to cover rank-and-file <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> members who had nothing to do with international terrorism. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> closed the probe in June 1985 after failing to establish any substantial link between <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> and international terrorism. Sessions said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> probe committed no illegal acts and no violations of constitutional rights.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is steeping himself in the symbols and rhetoric of patriotism while stepping up accusations that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is an out-of-touch liberal who acts like a chameleon on the campaign trail. In campaign appearances on Friday, the Republican presidential candidate ridiculed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign trip this week to plants and other facilities run by defense contractors. In one appearance, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> rode in an M-1 tank. `` I ca n't say he's not trying, the opponent from <LOCATION> Masachusetts </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a rally in Findlay, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, honoring the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag. `` He drove a tank this week but after he drove it, the tank kept veering left.'' In a news conference earlier Friday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> accused the Democratic <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor of being a `` made over'' candidate who is trying to hide a liberal record from American voters. After opposing the MX missile, the Midgetman, and the B-1 Bomber, `` Now suddenly he rides around in a tank, jumps out of the tank, takes off the helmet and comes on with different positions,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> charged. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has since modified his opposition on the B-1. `` The tank did not fit,'' he said. `` It's time to take another message to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> ... You can not fool the Soviet leadership by knocking <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s defense for 10 years and then riding around in a tank for 10 minutes ... You ca n't fool the American people.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made the comments in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, after a tour of the <LOCATION> Buckeye </LOCATION> Steel plant where his grandfather, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, was president in the early part of the centry.

His appearance in the city, which was formally designated <LOCATION> Flag </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, in 1974, was to help kick off the town's three-day festival honoring the flag He said the Findlay townspeople got <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to designate their city <LOCATION> Flag </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in 1974 because `` the time had come to stand up for the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag and the values it represented and that is good old-fashioned patriotism.'' A crowd of a few thousand crowded the town intersection where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke from the steps of the stately old <ORGANIZATION> Elks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> building. Of the flag he said, `` It is the symbol of these <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and to the liberty for which it stands one nation under god, with freedom and justice for all.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has made a campaign target of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' gubernatorial veto of a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> measure to require teachers to lead their students in the pledge of allegiance to the flag. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is trying to hide his liberalism. `` He refuses to repeat the positions that he took in wrapping up that <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` He ran way out on the left and now he's trying to move over, and I'd say make the American people forget the positions that he ran on and the positions that he's lived on since he's been the liberal governor of the state of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>.'' Later <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> continued to emphasize his own pro-defense themes when he helped unveil a monument to the Airmen who died in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Wright-Patterson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has planned a quiet weekend, with only one public event, attending a naturalization ceremony today for a group of immigrants.

 Republican vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has a new campaign battle cry: `` endive!'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> got a lot of mileage in farm states Friday out of the leafy vegetable and some pithy one-liners as he accused Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of being `` out of touch'' with the nation's heartland `` We need people who will listen to agriculture, not talk down to it,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said in speeches in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>. `` I reviewed the farm program of the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. His idea of farm production is growing flowers in <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yard </ORGANIZATION>.'' In his five-day campaign swing through the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> states, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> increasingly turned to ridicule and hyperbole to make his points. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is spending the weekend at home in <LOCATION> McLean </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. He attends a picnic today at the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> home of Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, the ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, on which <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also serves. On Friday, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> ridiculed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic presidential nominee, for suggestions that livestock and grain farmers consider growing Belgian endive. `` During the primary season last winter, our opponent responded that one of the answers to helping farmers was for them to grow different crops,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` He suggested blueberries and Belgian endive to pull farmers out of their economic doldrums.'' Republicans have been making hay of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' endive remark, which he made in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, since the Republican National Convention. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the `` entire national market'' for Belgian endive is worth less than $ 10 million per year. `` So if you start growing these little things, do n't count on paying off the farm debt,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. He got laughs from the crowds when he held up a head of endive to show them `` just how the man from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> thinks he can rebuild the farm economy.'' In <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> joined in after the audience started chanting: `` endive! endive!'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, he said, does n't understand the `` heartland of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' and is `` out of touch with the people across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' He said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also had switched `` back and forth'' so much on defense issues in recent days that `` I decided to sum it up this way: His farm policy is the Belgian endive and his defense policy is the Belgian waffle.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said a <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would open more markets abroad for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural products, support development of alternative fuels such as ethanol, which is made from grain, and focus more on rural economic development. `` We'll get that capital gains tax down to 15 percent and that will help small businesses which means more jobs here in the heartland,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` I can also assure you that with us, you get folks who are experienced in lowering interest rates, lowering inflation, creating jobs, increasing productivity and keeping the peace,''

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> laid part of the blame for <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>'s growing drug problem on <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as he pledged more agents and prosecutors in a stepped up fight against drug kingpins. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was supposed to be in charge of that war, and we all know what happened,'' the Democratic presidential nominee told students at <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in the Latino section of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on Friday. `` You know, if you do n't show up at school, you fail, and if you do n't show up at your job as chief officer of the war on drugs, you fail, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people lose, and the drug lords take over,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, trying to reverse a slide in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> polls, was campaigning for a second day in the state today. He was meeting with campaign workers in <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, a conservative Republican area where the campaign hopes to cut into <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s expected support. From there, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was flying back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to meet with members of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> at a dinner <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was expected to attend. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor planned to resume campaigning Monday with stops in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, possibly to visit hurricane-damaged areas, while devoting much of the rest of his week to preparations for meeting his Republican rival in their first debate. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made drugs the focus of his <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> foray, and he suggested the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had slighted <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in favor of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in allocating anti-drug resources. `` Today you have less than half the number of <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Drug Enforcement Admininstration -RRB- agents they have in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told rookies at the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>. `` That's going to change.'' <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the largest state with 47 electoral votes, is considered a crucial battleground along with <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> for the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign _ while <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> remains virtually out of reach and has been the object of little personal campaigning by the candidate. However, his running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, visited <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on Friday and today. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> pledged to double the 2,800 <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents nationally over five years, beginning with 600 next year, and to add 800 new federal prosecutors in an effort to speed up handling of drug cases. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> promised to send the first 100 drug agents to <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where he said cocaine seizures have risen 3,500 percent during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years and there have been `` massive increases'' in drug-related deaths. Campaign aides said the prosecutors would cost $ 40 million and the new drug agents would cost $ 50 million the first year. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> asserted that the agents would pay for themselves, however, through seizure and forefeiture of assets. `` It's really a no-cost step,'' he told police officers in <LOCATION> Chula </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vista </LOCATION>, just south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. Outside the <LOCATION> Chula </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vista </LOCATION> police station, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was greeted by demonstrators needling him for his prison furlough policy, which was changed in the face of public opposition. Several demonstrators wore mock prisoner's stripes. They chanted, `` Let me out, I'll kill again.'' One carried a sign saying `` Hey <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>, thanks for the weekend.''

 Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> stood in a downtown ballroom, on courthouse steps and at a shuffleboard court _ in three different cities _ to deliver the same message. `` I'm looking for old friends who wandered away in recent years,'' he said. `` I'm talking to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Democrats. I'm urging them to come home, and they're responding.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator who <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> picked as running mate to help woo the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, spoke Friday morning in a <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> hotel and in the afternoon at the <LOCATION> Pitt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, courthouse in <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>. There, he spiced his stump speech with a rebuke of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attempts to denigrate <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' performance as <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor. `` Under <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> unemployment is the lowest rate of any major industrial state in this union,'' he said. `` Wages are growing twice as fast as the national average, personal income growing faster than any other state, and he submitted ten balanced budgets in a row. `` When <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> speaks out against <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.

By evening, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, in a trailer park's shuffleboard area next to a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cutter </ORGANIZATION>, where he tailored his speech with an attack on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for failure in the fight against drug imports `` They asked him to lead'' the fight against drugs, he said. `` And he blew it badly.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was joined by Sen. <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., an old friend from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> who also accompanied him to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> The <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> stop also included a ritzy, closed-door fund-raiser at the home of a prominent attorney. About $ 50,000 was raised for <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> re-election campaign. Under an unusual <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is running both for the vice presidency and a fourth term in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The vice presidential campaign, which had been bogged down by scheduling difficulties the day before, appeared to be picking up the pace. `` We've had a helluva good day,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told reporters on his campaign plane. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this afternoon and heading back on Monday to his home state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to resume campaigning. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> expressed relief that Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> appeared to be going ashore in a sparsely-populated area of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> pledged in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to fight the nation's drug problem with more spending and more hiring, while <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> questioned his rival's sincerity on defense issues as both candidates planned for the first presidential debate of the campaign. In a speech Friday at the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, the Democratic presidential nominee told recruits he would double the number of <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agents over the next five years, paying for the increase with cash and other assets seized in drug busts. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also pledged to hire 800 more federal prosecutors. `` We're going to send a message to drug kingpins,'' he said. `` As far as <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is concerned, there's nowhere you can run, there's nowhere you can sail, there's nowhere you can hide. There will be no safe haven for dope peddlers and drug profits anywhere on this Earth.'' But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in a later appearance, mistakenly said that <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents at one point had to hold a bake sale to raise stakeout money. Aides explained that the book that was the source of that anecdote said the bake sale was held to raise money for drug education. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the Republican nominee, spent much of the day in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, where he derided what he called <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' shifting positions on defense. `` You can not fool the Soviet leadership by knocking <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s defense for 10 years and then riding around in a tank for 10 minutes,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Friday in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, making light of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' well-filmed visit to a tank design facility `` You ca n't fool the American people. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, combined that criticism with a jab at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' farm policy by referring to his statement that cash grain and livestock farmers should consider alternative crops such as Belgian endive and blueberries. Contending that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is out of touch with <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told an audience in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>.: `` I decided to sum it up this way: His farm policy is the Belgian endive and his defense policy is the Belgian waffle.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was finishing a five-day swing of <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and Plains states. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s Democratic counterpart, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, took special aim during an appearance in <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s claim Thursday that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> mismanaged <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' fiscal affairs `` When <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> speaks out against <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' he said, `` we should all remember that when it came to speaking out against arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, when it came to speaking out against cozy deals with Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, when it came to speaking out against economic policies that have almost tripled the national debt, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did n't speak, he just voted present.''

Several demonstrators wore mock prisoner's stripes. They chanted, `` Let me out, I'll kill again.'' One carried a sign saying `` Hey <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>, thanks for the weekend.'' In Findlay, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, where the annual flag celebration was held Friday, some residents complained <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had turned it into a political photo opportunity. `` What was intended to be a non-partisan promotion of fun and patriotism has turned into a partisan use of the flag for private gain by a candidate,'' said local businessman <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>.

Both men have set aside large parts of next week to prepare for their first debate of the fall presidential campaign, a 90-minute nationally televised session a week from Sunday in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Conflicting Testimony On Whether Alcoholism Hurt Deaver's Memory</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The judge who will sentence <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> for perjury is pondering sharply conflicting testimony about whether alcoholism impaired the former presidential aide's memory when he gave sworn testimony. Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>'s doctor during two hospital visits for alcoholism in 1985 and 1986, said the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide likely suffered memory impairment from tranquilizers he took for alcohol withdrawal. But <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarter </PERSON>, an alcoholism expert testifying for the prosecution, said `` motivational reasons rather than neurological reasons'' best explained <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>'s failures of recollection under oath. Attorneys for <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> offered two days of medical testimony to show that alcoholism should be considered a mitigating factor when the former presidential aide is sentenced for lying when his lobbying was investigated for possible ethics-law violations. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Penfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is scheduled to sentence <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> on Sept. 23. The former deputy White House chief of staff faces a possible five-year sentence and a $ 6,800 fine for each of three perjury counts. <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> was found guilty last year of lying when he said he could n't recall contacting former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration colleagues on behalf of major corporations who paid him six-figure fees for his services. <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, head of the alcoholism and drug abuse clinic at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, testified that <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> `` definitely'' suffered memory and judgment impairments during two hospital stays for detoxification. But on cross-examination, <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> admitted to independent counsel <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> that he never tested <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> for memory loss during the hospital stays and meant to say that `` people in that situation have impaired memory and judgment.'' <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> also provided another piece of circumstantial evidence that <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> telephoned then-Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Word </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> was talking on the phone at 5 p.m. June 3, 1985 when he first entered the former presidential aide's room at the hospital, <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said. A log kept by Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s secretary that was produced at the trial showed <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> had called the Cabinet official at precisely that hour. Among other things, <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> was convicted of lying when he told a federal grand jury on June 20, 1986 that `` I do n't recall any government contact I made on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>.'' The defense is trying to show that <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> honestly could n't recall the telephone contact because he was drugged and suffering from alcoholic withdrawal But <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, who testified that <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> later took heavy doses of the tranquilizer Valium to counteract alcohol withdrawal, said the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide was neither drunk nor sedated by a dose of <LOCATION> Librium </LOCATION> he took 30 minutes earlier. The defense countered with Dr. <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> physician who treats alcoholics. She said medical records showed that by 1985 when <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> had resigned from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s staff his alcoholism had reached an advanced stage. Kidney failure that kept <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> from attending <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s second inaugural in January 1985 was `` a classic example'' of the medical complications of alcoholism, she said. It was misdiagnosed as an allergic reaction to blood-pressure medicine because <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> did n't tell doctors he was drinking heavily <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> probably understated his problem when he told <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> and other doctors six months later that he had only recently started drinking more than a fifth of Scotch whisky a day. On appeal, the defense is expected to repeat arguments that improper trial rulings by the judge put <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> at a strategic disadvantage that prevented him from testifying. The defense, confronted with these rulings from the bench, chose to rest its case without calling <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> or any of the medical experts who were prepared to testify.

<HEAD>Seabrook Finances Now Lone Obstacle To Low-Power License</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> says the idled <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, reactor will not get a low-power operating license until regulators are convinced the plant's owners are financially stable. But <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> officials, buoyed by a commission vote Friday that removed the only other regulatory obstacle to gaining the license, said they will begin immediately preparing the reactor for low-power testing in anticipation of a license. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> voted 4-0 for a rules `` clarification'' that will allow nuclear plants to receive low-power permits without an emergency siren system in place to alert neighbors within 10 miles of the reactors of an atomic emergency. Commission regulations say financial qualification should not be a consideration for a low-power license, but <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lando </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said there are extenuating circumstances in the <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> case. For the first time, he said, <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s finances would be a factor in consideration of a low-power license. `` It's a serious issue,'' <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> told reporters after the hearing. `` We'll be watching closely to see the financial qualification situation at <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Zech </PERSON>'s concerns focused on <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION>, a partial <ORGANIZATION> Seabrook </ORGANIZATION> owner which filed for bankruptcy reorganization last January. `` In my judgment, bankruptcy is a special case,'' the chairman said. `` ... We should be satisfied that bankruptcy will not prevent safe, low-power operation.'' <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> communities within <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s 10-mile zone fought successfully to have the emergency sirens removed. State officials led by Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic presidential nominee, believe those coastal towns, with their narrow roads and bulging summer populations, would not be able to evacuate quickly. The new rule takes effect in 30 days. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, president of the reactor's owner, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION>, hailed the commission vote as `` another major step forward for <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> blasted the ruling, saying it `` defies logic and brings new meaning to the word irresponsible.'' He derided the commission as the `` Not <ORGANIZATION> Responsible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'' and said it `` is experiencing a meltdown in its thinking process.'' The lone regulatory obstacle remaining for <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s low-power license is a petition filed by plant opponents charging that the reactor's owners are financially unfit to operate the plant. That question was tentatively scheduled for a vote following the siren issue, but was postponed. The idle $ 5.6 billion reactor is losing $ 50 million each month in maintenance and finance costs. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Malsch </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> deputy general counsel, said he hoped the commission would have the issue resolved within a month. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> officials said they were optimistic of a favorable ruling. `` We feel we have proved to the commission that we are financially qualified,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sher </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION>. If the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> rules that the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> owners are financially fit, the plant would be eligible for a low-power license, which allows it to run tests at 5 percent power. The owners need the 5 percent permit before securing a full-power commercial license, while opponents say low-power testing would contaminate the reactor with radioactive fuel and make a future conversion to a gas-fired plant much more expensive.

<HEAD>`Truth-in-Contracting' Rules Loosened By Pentagon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Pentagon has slightly relaxed the `` truth-in-contracting'' regulations it imposed after this summer's disclosure of a massive fraud investigation But it refused to drop the rules altogether as industry asked. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> on Friday said its <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Procurement `` has determined that both the Certificate of Contractor Business Ethics and Integrity and the Profit Recapture Clause remain necessary to protect the government's interests ...'' The certification and profit recapture regulations were imposed July 15 against defense contractors named in search warrants obtained by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Fifteen companies are currently subject to the special requirements. The investigation, which became public in June, concerns allegations that defense contractors hired outside consultants to obtain proprietary information on the bids of competing defense companies, and that the consultants may have paid bribes to <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> employees to get such information. The certification clause requires any of the contractors who receive a contract worth at least $ 100,000 to certify that they have not obtained any inside information. The profit recapture regulation specifies the Pentagon can reclaim profits from any company that has obtained sensitive information improperly. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said it was narrowing the application of the certification rule by specifying the written pledge would be required only when a contractor is competing with other firms to start a new project. Under the initial version of the rule, if a contractor was on the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s list, the requirement was imposed regardless of whether the contract was sole-source or competitive, and regardless of whether it was for the start of a project or to expand work awarded to the company earlier. A <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official who asked not to be named said the change was designed to lighten somewhat industry fears that firms could be held accountable now for actions that dated back several years.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is loosening the regulatory reins on <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> by allowing the long-distance leader to offer special discounts to business customers. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said in a written order Friday that <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T will be able to offer special pricing plans for telecommunications services to respond to individual customers who have been offered lower prices by competing long-distance companies. `` The commission action recognizes the intense level of competition in the business long-distance market and it allows <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T to respond competitively as conditions warrant,'' <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T said. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> said the decision was `` good news for all telecommunications customers'' because it would enable the company to attract more large-business customers to its networks, `` with cost savings flowing to all.'' But <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's competitors, including <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, had objected to <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION>'s pricing plan, saying that if discount pricing were allowed, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T would be able to undercut the competition with predatory pricing. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T had proposed the discount pricing plan after <ORGANIZATION> Holiday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> told the company it planned to switch its chain of Holiday Inn hotels to <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> long-distance services unless <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> could offer a plan that was priced competitively. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T, which serves about 70 percent of the long-distance market, is the only long-distance carrier whose rates are subject to federal regulation and which must file with the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> the prices it charges for its services. Other carriers can set their prices below <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's and offer customers special discounted packages of services to individual customers. The agency's action allows <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T to offer a pricing plan for <ORGANIZATION> Holiday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> that will provide long-distance services to Holiday Inns at rates 5 percent to 10 percent below <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's <LOCATION> PRO </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> II service, which is offered to other business cutomers. The Holiday plan will be allowed to go into effect today, but the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> will conduct an investigation and is requiring the company to keep separate accounts of the costs and revenues generated by the account to assure that other <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T ratepayers will not be subsidizing the discounts for Holiday, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said. As part of the investigation, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said it would consider whether the pricing plan can be justified under the 1934 Communications Act, which prohibits telephone companies from offering rates that are unreasonably or unduly discriminatory among its customers. The commission said it would conclude the investigation promptly but set no deadline. Commissioner <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, one of the three sitting <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> commissioners, dissented from the decision, saying she objected to allowing <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T to put its Holiday pricing plan into effect until the investigation was completed. She said she questioned whether the Holiday pricing plan was legal. `` There is a strong likelihood that the commission is allowing an unreasonably discriminatory and unlawful tariff to take effect,'' she said.

 A mix-up between the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, a Ukrainian group, and organizers of a massive quilt memorializing people who have died of AIDS is causing logistical problems in the nation's capital. Organizers of the Names Project, a 16-ton quilt bearing 10,000 names of AIDS victims, thought everything was set for the site of their Oct. 8 ceremony, in which the quilt is to be displayed and the names read. But the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> instead promised use of the Ellipse, a circular lawn behind the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, to a group of Ukrainians who plan to hold a rally and march to celebrate 1,000 years of Christianity the same day.

<HEAD>Shultz Says Israel Must End Occupation; Rejects Palestinian State</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said an <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> peace depends on the Palestinians dropping their demand for an independent state and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> ending its military control of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Speaking Friday on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the Camp David accords, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> rejected a proposal by <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> be forced to withdraw to the lines of partition approved by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> before the Jewish state was established in 1948. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will never negotiate from or return to the lines of partition,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said in remarks prepared for a <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> conference at the <LOCATION> Wye </LOCATION> plantation near <LOCATION> Queenstown </LOCATION>, Md. `` But it must be prepared to withdraw _ as Resolution 242 says _ from territories occupied in the recent conflict,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` Peace and security for all sides are at stake.'' He quoted from the resolution approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> at the end of the 1967 <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> war. It does not specifically call on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to give up all the territory the <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION> lost _ and nor did <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. But he also did not call for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s retention of any of the land, which includes the eastern half of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> that has become part of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s capital. The speech had the earmarks of a valedictory. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> spoke of `` fundamental constants'' that he suggested the next administration consider in seeking an <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> settlement. The first point was that `` the status quo serves the interest of no party'' and that peace in the region depends on an agreement between Palestinians and Israelis. On the Arab side, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> gave high priority to the Palestinians and referred almost in passing to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> whose King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> this summer abandoned any claim to represent the 1.4 million Palestinians who live on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. `` Palestinians need to achieve rapid control over political and economic decisions that affect their lives,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` Israelis need time to adjust to a new situation, one in which Palestinians _ not <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military government officials _ administer the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>.'' He rejected the position taken by some Israelis that since Palestinians form a clear majority of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s population the country should become their state while <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> retains the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> is a vibrant and heterogenous society, with a strong national identity of its own,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` It is not a Palestinian state.'' He said <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> have a right to participate actively in every stage of negotiations and `` must approve the outcome.'' At the same time, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> called on Palestinians to pursue credible goals. `` The status of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> can not be determined by unilateral acts of either side, but only through a process of negotiations,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` A declaration of independent Palestinian statehood or government-in-exile would be such a unilateral act,'' he said. In four trips to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> this year <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was unable to set up <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace talks. Palestinians, under <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s instructions, boycotted his attempts to meet with them <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> demanded a commitment from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> that it would give up the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, while <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> opposed the peace conference <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> proposed because it might give an influential role to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In the speech, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> backed off. He said a peace conference `` may'' be necessary and stressed a need for direct negotiations among the parties. Asked if <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> would return to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> before leaving office in January, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official who insisted on anonymity said: `` I do n't see that right now.''

<HEAD>Complaints Lead Sub Base To Pull Fonda Tapes</HEAD>

 <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>'s exercise videotapes were pulled from the shelves of the Naval Submarine Base retail store because of complaints over her anti-Vietnam War activities, a base spokesman said. `` It reflects the consumer concern and nothing more,'' said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>. Only two or three copies of several different titles were removed, he said. One of the two complaints came from <PERSON> Gaetano </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Russo </PERSON>, a retired major general of the <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> who organized anti-Fonda protests of a movie she filmed in <LOCATION> Waterbury </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Russo </PERSON> said he walked into the store and saw a Fonda tape being played on a video recorder. `` I told them it was an insult to every American that ever lived,'' <PERSON> Russo </PERSON> said Friday. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pillar </PERSON>, a member of the <LOCATION> Groton </LOCATION> Representative Town Meeting, said he also complained to <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> authorities about the tapes.

She also was photographed next to a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun. <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> apologized this summer on national television to veterans who may have been hurt by her actions, but her effort at reconciliation was rejected by both the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON>, a spokesman for the actress in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said he was surprised that the tapes were removed because of only two complaints, particularly because the military's job `` is to defend and protect our freedoms.'' `` We have all the right to opinions, to express them, and -LRB- should -RRB- respect the rights of those who do n't agree with us,'' <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Polls Favor Governing Party But Indicate Greens May Gain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Final pre-election polls indicated <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> stands a good chance to stay in office, but the environmentalist Greens may win seats and a role as a legislative power broker. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s high taxes and welfare system and the non-socialist opposition's ability to govern were chief issues in a television and radio debate Friday that analysts said could tip the balance in Sunday's election. Ten percent of voters questioned this week said they were still undecided. <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> supporters demonstrated outside the television studio hall because their party was excluded from the broadcast debate. Swedish public television said it was open only to incumbent parties. The Greens failed to clear the 4 percent minimum for legislative representation in the two previous elections they contested, but this summer's ecological disasters and general discontent among young voters have boosted their chances for seats _ and perhaps a role in a coalition government. The five parliamentary party leaders all stressed the environment in opening statements, but in the ensuing debate concentrated on calls for more housing and improved retiree, health and child-care benefits. A poll by the <ORGANIZATION> Swedish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> SIPO </ORGANIZATION>, forecast that Prime Minister <PERSON> Ingvar </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON>'s Social Democrats and the small <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would win a combined 46.2 percent of the vote. The three non-socialist parties polled a total 44.6 percent in the survey of 1,094 people taken from Monday through Thursday. The balance between the two blocs was taken by the <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, or Greens, with 7.1 percent. The margin of error was about 2 percent, said institute director <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>. Another poll of 1,500 people by the <ORGANIZATION> IMU </ORGANIZATION> institute forecast a 49.2 percent total for the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communists </ORGANIZATION>, enough to make the governing bloc independent of the Greens. A third poll by the SEMKA institute forecast a more even situation outcome, with 45.6 percent for the socialist bloc and 44.1 for the non-socialists. The Greens polled 6.9 percent. <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> repeatedly questioned what he called the non-socialist opposition's lack of a joint platform, referring to internal quarrels that split their coalition governments in 1976-82. `` Voters alas have not received an answer about the non-socialist so-called government alternative,'' <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> said. `` You may wake up Monday morning and have a policy you do not have a clue about.'' <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Bildt </PERSON> said the Conservatives, Liberals and Center parties had `` presented their aims.'' In the only reference to foreign policy, <PERSON> Bildt </PERSON> called for a Swedish entry into the European Market, while <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> should cooperate with the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> `` except on foreign and defense policy,'' citing <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s neutrality. Also absent were references to the `` Carlsson affair,'' the Social Democrats' attempt with the help of publisher turned private detective <PERSON> Ebbe </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> to investigate leads in the 1986 assassination of former Prime Minister <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>. The private investigation, undertaken without the knowledge of Swedish authorities, forced Minister of Justice <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Greta </PERSON> <PERSON> Leijon </PERSON> to resign last June. The socialist bloc won a majority of 50.1 percent in the 1985 election to the 349-seat Riksdag, or parliament. Social Democratic leaders have said the party would stay in office as a minority government if it could. Their ability to govern would be in doubt if the Communists fail to pass the 4 percent barrier and drop out of the legislature. The <ORGANIZATION> SIFO </ORGANIZATION> poll gave the Communists 4.2 percent, an edge that could be wiped out by the margin of error. Both blocs have said they would not rely on the Greens to form a government. The Social Democrats have governed <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> for 50 of the last 56 years with the support of smaller parties. Normal voter turnout is about 90 percent of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s 6.3 million eligible voters.

<TEXT>
 Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> slammed the Texas-Mexico coast with heavy rain, high waves and tornadoes Friday, and thousands of <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> residents fled inland or huddled in public shelters and boarded-up homes. Heavy rain fell on this southernmost <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> city and wind gusts to 62 mph were measured at the airport and to 65 mph at Port Isabel. Up to 5 inches of rain was forecast, along with tides 7 to 11 feet above normal. Nearly two dozen tornadoes were reported around <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> as <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> made its way ashore, overturning cars and mobile homes and tearing the roofs from buildings. Some injuries but no deaths were reported. Police in nearby <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> said the windows of 20 to 30 cars in a parking lot were shattered by high winds or a tornado. Low-lying coastal roads were closed by high water. A <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> helicopter rescued the crews of three fishing boats run aground in the storm-tossed <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, plucking five people from a 70-foot fishing boat and found the crew of its sister boat beached near <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isabel </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> also rescued a third missing boat and crew in <LOCATION> Matagorda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. `` We're just full of happy endings today, which is great with a storm like this,'' said Petty Officer <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Morehead </PERSON>. At 11 p.m. CDT, the center of the storm was near latitude 24.6 north and longitude 98.6 west, or about 115 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>. Its highest sustained winds had slackened to 105 mph. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, which for a time earlier this week was the most powerful storm on record in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>, weakened somewhat but remained a dangerous storm, responsible for at least 70 deaths and billions of dollars in damage as it roared across the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and through the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The calm eye at the heart of the hurricane made landfall about 120 miles south of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> at 4:35 p.m. CDT, in <LOCATION> Tamaulipas </LOCATION> state, said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>, meteorologist at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. It was moving west-northwest at about 12 mph, and was expected to follow that track through mid-day Saturday, before turning gradually to the northwest, forecasters said. `` The rain was blowing sideways,'' said <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Wooddell </PERSON>, who chose to ride out the storm in her home Saturday. By 11 p.m., hurricane warnings for the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> coast from <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> O'Connor to <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> were downgraded to a high wind warning, but coastal flood warnings were posted for the entire <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> coast. `` The danger of flash flooding in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is very great. Rainfall as high as 10 to 15 inches _ maybe even 20 inches _ is expected,'' <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON> said. Remnants of <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> should bring very heavy rains this weekend to <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> valley of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> before heading north up the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> as a `` huge rain-making machine,'' <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON> said. Hurricane-force winds should end by early Saturday. By mid-week, the storm should be in lower <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> will last be heard of as a rain storm somewhere in the Great Lakes,'' he said. The eye passed over <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rosa </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, two small Mexican villages a few miles north of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pesca </LOCATION>, which has a population of about 500, said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>, meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center. The mayor of <LOCATION> Soto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> la </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION>, 20 miles inland from <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pesca </LOCATION>, was contacted by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> as the storm struck his town of 8,000 residents. Mayor <PERSON> Hinojosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortina </PERSON> said the town's situation <PERSON> Marina </PERSON> was `` getting worse with every passing minute. There are very strong winds. It's all dark. There is no electricity and no water. Trees have been uprooted.'' <PERSON> Cortina </PERSON> said some residents had fled the town in advance of the hurricane but many remained. Other town officials said 3,000 people from fishing villages along the coast were given shelter in <LOCATION> Soto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> la </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>, an industrial city with a population of about 3 million, is the closest major city that could be affected. It is 210 miles northwest of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pesca </LOCATION>, but protected by the small mountain range of the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tamaulipas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON> said the range should break up circulation of hurricane winds and accelerate drop in wind speed, which naturally occurs when storm moves over land. But he also said very heavy rains could cause flash floods and mudslides. Thousands of people also evacuated in neighboring areas of northeastern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, including the entire beach area of <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, a city of 280,000 just across the border, which includes posh vacation homes, restaurants and small fishing villages, officials said. Many streets in <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> were flooded and officials said about 5,000 people fled their homes in low-lying coastal areas. Winds of 35 mph, gusting as high as 57 mph, knocked out power to the city. `` Up to now the damages are not considered very grave,'' said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Inez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, a city spokesman. He said officials distributed crackers and water to thousands of people in shelters and urged them to stay until the storm ended. To the south, about 300,000 people were homeless in <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> and 10,000 more were homeless in <LOCATION> Campeche </LOCATION>, on the west coast of the peninsula, the government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> said. Violent weather surrounding the hurricane spun off more than a half-dozen tornadoes over the <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> area Friday, blowing over at least two homes and slightly injuring one person. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s influence extended far across the Gulf and thunderstorms that were part of its circulation spawned tornadoes in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> The roof was ripped from a <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> apartment complex and windows were blown out. Police in nearby <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> said the windows of 20-30 cars in a parking lot were shattered by high wind or a tornado. Despite the danger of flying debris, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON>, 16, was skateboarding down <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boulevard </ORGANIZATION> when the storm neared its peak. `` There's a lot of movement and it's fun,'' <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> said. `` I know it's dangerous. I've fallen down a couple of times but it's just a thrill.'' Some 125 shelters holding 50,000 people were open in a four-county area of southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> around <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lohman </PERSON> said. An estimated 25,000 people evacuated as a precaution in southern <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, as did about 40 percent of the 65,000 residents of the island city of <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>, but most people in those two areas were allowed to return home Friday when the storm's track seemed certain to avoid them. <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> resembled a ghost town Friday, with many of its 100,000 residents having fled to schools, auditoriums and churches. Electrical power was out in some areas and sporadic in others. But city spokeswoman <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Downing </PERSON> estimated at least 50 percent of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>'s residents live at or below the poverty line and could not afford to leave. `` Obviously, we have those that live in substandard housing and they have no way of getting out of here,'' she said. `` And if they do get out of town, the cost of supplies would be too much and their finances basically force them to stay here.'' Police fanned out in colonias _ where people live in metal-roofed, plywood shacks _ to make certain residents had left. `` We do n't want to panic anybody but we wanted to tell them that if they did not get out now, it would be very difficult to get out later,'' police Sgt. Dean <PERSON> Poos </PERSON> said as officers went through a flood-prone area of town known as <LOCATION> Southmost </LOCATION>, about 20 miles from the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> along the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>. Mayor <PERSON> Ygnacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> at mid-day halted police from warning people to leave. Tornadoes and flooding by then made travel too dangerous, said <ORGANIZATION> Hidalgo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>. `` People are being advised to just stay where they're at and ride the storm through,'' he said. Downing estimated only 20 percent of the residents had left town. `` We did n't want to go anywhere but here anyway,'' <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, 78, said while he and his invalid wife, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>, waited out the storm at a public shelter. `` Our house is pretty old. We left everything in there. If it falls, we know it does n't have to go very far, but I do n't know what we'll do if it is damaged.'' One <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> drowning was indirectly related to the hurricane. A 3-year-old boy fell from his family's shrimp boat when they moved the vessel for safe mooring, said <LOCATION> Calhoun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's spokesman <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Prush </PERSON> The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> rescued 16 people from three fishing boats, two near <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isabel </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> Matagorda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> sent <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> units to <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> and <PERSON> Corpus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christi </PERSON>.

All occurred in the three <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION> states of <LOCATION> Campeche </LOCATION>, Yucatan and <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> <PERSON> Roo </PERSON>. Authorities said Friday that 10 people were missing in the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> state. The mayor of <LOCATION> Soto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> la </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION>, 20 miles inland from <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pesca </LOCATION>, was contacted by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> as the storm struck his town of 8,000 residents. Mayor <PERSON> Hinojosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortina </PERSON> said the situation in <PERSON> Soto </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Marina </PERSON> was `` getting worse with every passing minute. There are very strong winds. It's all dark. There is no electricity and no water. Trees have been uprooted.'' <PERSON> Cortina </PERSON> said some residents had fled the town in advance of the hurricane but many remained. Other town officials said 3,000 people from fishing villages along the coast were given shelter in <LOCATION> Soto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> la </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION>. Many streets in <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> were flooded and officials said about 5,000 people fled their homes in low-lying coastal areas. At 9 p.m. EDT -LRB- 8 p.m. CDT -RRB-, the eye of the hurricane was near latitude 24.4 north, longitude 98.1 west, or about 110 miles south southwest of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, the National Hurricane Center said. It said <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was moving toward the west-northwest at 12 mph. The report said flash floods and tides of 7 to 11 feet above normal were expected near and to the north of where the storm came ashore. <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>, an industrial city with a population of about three million, is the closest major city that could be affected. It is 210 miles northwest of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pesca </LOCATION> but <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tamaulipas </LOCATION>, a small mountain range between <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> and the coast, should blunt the hurricane's strentth, said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>, a meterologist at National Hurricane Center. He said the range should break up circulation of hurricane and accelerate drop in wind speed, which naturally occurs when storm moves over land. But <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON> said he expects very heavy rains as warm hurricane winds rise into cooler mountain air. This could cause flash floods and mudslides, he said. The hurricane struck the Mexican coast first Wednesday morning, roaring into the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. About 300,000 people were homeless in <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> and 10,000 more were homeless in <LOCATION> Campeche </LOCATION> on the west coast of the peninsula, the government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> said. The mayor of <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>, on the east coast of the peninsula, said 11,000 tourists and residents were evacuated from beachfront areas before the storm hit. <PERSON> Power </PERSON> and communications were still out in much of <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION>, thousands of people remained in shelters, many areas were flooded and transportation was only partially restored. The <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cozumel </LOCATION> airports opened Friday, allowing 8,000 tourists to begin leaving the popular <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> resorts. The damage `` looks awesome and spectacular,'' Tourism Secretary <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Enriquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Savignac </PERSON> said during an appearance on the private <ORGANIZATION> Televisa </ORGANIZATION> network Friday after returning from a flight over the area. <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, only 25 feet above sea level and 12 miles from shore, lacks natural wind breaks such as hills or high buildings. Authorities said their main worry was flooding, which already affected some streets. Officials said about 5,000 people spent Thursday night in shelters. Countless others already have fled the city for towns farther inland, while thousands waited out the hurricane behind boarded or taped doors and windows. `` Our house started flooding, so we called the police and they brought us here,'' said <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Crecencia </PERSON> <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON>, a 45-year-old mother of 10 who sought shelter in a church meeting hall, one of 126 shelters set up in <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>. The refugees, mostly poor families, said they spent all night Thursday in the shelters without food or blankets. `` They closed a lot of stores because too many people were packing in,'' said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON>, 29. `` Most of us did n't get any food.'' The Matamoros airport was closed at midmorning. About 100 miles south of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pesca </LOCATION>, heavy winds and rains pounded the oil port of <LOCATION> Tampico </LOCATION> where 30 ships were anchored. Power was cut in some areas and the airport and coastal highway were closed, according to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tampico </LOCATION>, the local paper. Nearly 1,000 miles away from <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, across the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, much of the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> was in tatters. Glbert caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damages as it rolled across three states of the peninsula destroying 90 per cent of the corn and fruit crops. But tourism officials were optimistic they could put <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cozumel </LOCATION> back in working order in six weeks, in time for the height of the fall and winter season.

 A sixth human body part has been found in the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, and medical examiners say it appears the victim, a young woman, was shot before her body was cut into segments with a power saw. The latest grisly discovery, made late Thursday, came near <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION> where four other parts have been discovered, said <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dulaney </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> Hancock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, Sheriff's department, which is handling the <LOCATION> Hancock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner Dr. <PERSON> Reynaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Vista </PERSON> identified the latest part as a right hip. He said Friday he believes a puncture on the left side of the torso was caused by a small-caliber bullet. On Wednesday, barge workers found a fifth part, the victim's right arm, wedged between two coal barges when they stopped near <LOCATION> Kenova </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> The limb could have been picked up by the barge as far upstream as <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Medical Examiner <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sopher </PERSON>. The gruesome search began Sunday, when a fisherman between <LOCATION> Chester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> snagged his hook on a garbage bag, reeled it in and found a left human arm inside The next day, <LOCATION> Hancock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials searching the river downstream from where <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and Pennsylvana borders meet found more bags containing a thigh, part of a torso and a section of buttocks. The parts appear to have been severed with a type of power saw, and had been in the water up to 10 or 12 days, <PERSON> Sopher </PERSON> said. The victim was a short, white woman in her early 20s, he said. Authorities are matching her with the descriptions of about five women reported missing recently from <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. `` The main focus now is getting an ID on the body,'' <PERSON> Sopher </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON>, ace billboard painter, is juggling paint brushes and cans on a narrow board that dangles high above a swampy bog. `` You wo n't believe this, but I'm scared to death of heights,'' said <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON>, 36, who has acquired a reputation for creating portraits that loom many times larger than life. <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON>'s life work is art usually seen at a great distance in a fleeting glance from a car window. Instead of an appreciative museum audience, he can hope to impress only the myriad of passing travelers, such as casino tourists and truckers. His labors may last only a few days before being covered by the next advertisement. But the affable artist says he does n't mind. `` I enjoy looking at it for a couple of weeks. If I really like it, I'll deliberately pass it every day on my way to work just to see it,'' <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> said. Billboard painting requires a combination of the agility to climb rickety planks leading to the billboard, the talent to translate a tiny photograph into a mural hundreds of times larger and the pluck to endure rain, snow, sleet and heavy winds. <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> says he will paint almost anything on a billboard, but he especially enjoys assignments involving portraits. One day recently, he spent six hours painting <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>'s face, right down to the famous blue eyes `` With an older person like him, you have a lot more wrinkles and that's more time-consuming,'' he said, wiping the paint off his hands and onto his splattered flannel shirt and jeans. `` When I painted Miss <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> last week, her face was a lot easier because it's smooth,'' he said. `` But she had all that red hair.'' The job started on a whim. After majoring in biology in college, <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> grew restless and took a job painting small signs 10 years ago. Eventually, he started painting billboards for the R.C. <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. He began doing portraits slowly, reading art books and practicing with watercolors at home. Now an independent billboard painter, <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> is considered `` the best,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, general manager of R.C. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s office here `` He showed great promise early on,'' <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said. `` He expanded his talents so well and so quickly. He soon was thirsting for more intricate layouts.'' <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> acknowledges that good billboard painters are hard to find. `` Very few people set out to say, ` I'm going to be a billboard painter,''' he said. `` There are n't that many of us because you have to be good to get a job, and there's no place to learn this.'' A job begins with <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> charting out the photograph on a sheet of graph paper, which he then copies in pencil onto his giant `` canvas.'' He next fills in the colors, a tricky process that involves compensating for the changing light at different times of the day. During the process, he'll climb down the narrow planks quite frequently to walk several hundred yards away and evaluate the billboard through binoculars. Unlike billboards that are simply made of paper pasted onto the wood, a hand-painted billboard can last several years if varnished, <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> recalls only one instance in which he almost fell off a billboard. The pulleys gave way, and he scrambled for a line to catch. Sheepishly, <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> also admitted that a few paint cans have escaped his grip. `` I've dropped paint on the <LOCATION> Boardwalk </LOCATION> on a brand new awning, and I've even hit a few mink stoles, but they probably never knew where it came from.''

<TEXT>
 Armed left-wing rebels burst into a federal court building, freed five jailed comrades and abducted a judge's assistant, who was later found shot to death, police said. They said the guerrillas fired automatic weapons as they entered the building in the town of <LOCATION> Buga </LOCATION>, 160 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. Police said they captured two of the guerrillas freed in the attack after an hourlong chase. The body of the hostage was found beside a highway outside of town, police said. They did not report any other casualties or further elaborate. In other developments, leftist rebels freed 22 government soldiers and policemen captured in a northwestern <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> raid last month and also released two Colombian geologists seized in another attack, the government and military announced. The soldiers and policemen freed Friday had been taken prisoner Aug. 23 by guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> during a joint attack on the town of <LOCATION> Saiza </LOCATION>. A statement from President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcos </PERSON>'s office said a one-day cease-fire had been arranged so the captives could be released in the <LOCATION> Uraba </LOCATION> region, about 300 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. Two of the government troopers had been wounded in the rocket and mortar attack on the police station in <LOCATION> Saiza </LOCATION>, Gen. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said in an interview with the radio station <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION>. He did not elaborate. The two geologists released Thursday were among five who worked with coal companies and were kidnapped Aug. 20 by rebels of another guerrilla group, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, or ELN. Rebels freed the two geologists in an arranged meeting with a group of reporters in the city of <LOCATION> Bucaramanga </LOCATION>, 200 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. An <ORGANIZATION> ELN </ORGANIZATION> statement said the three other geologists would be released soon. A <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> communique released Friday said 1,174 people have been killed this year in guerrilla attacks and battles between rebels and security forces. It listed the slain as 499 guerrillas, 378 civilians and 297 policemen and soldiers. The ministry has reported 2,037 people were killed last year in fighting involving rebels, government forces and civilians caught in the violence.

 Leapfrogging questions over the morality of abortion, an advisory panel has concluded that federal researchers should be allowed to use fetal tissue in their quest for effective treatment for Parkinson's and other diseases. The leaders of a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> special panel convened to consider the topic complimented their colleagues Friday for focusing on questions put to them by top officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. Left unresolved was whether a proposed White House ban on using the remains of fetuses intentionally and legally aborted in such experimental treatments will be upheld during the waning months of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Also unanswered was whether President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is throwing his personal political weight behind the proposal, which was circulated for private review by administration health officials. The <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> panel voted late Friday _ 19-0, with two abstentions _ to `` recommend that research proceed.'' Retired federal appellate Judge <PERSON> Arlin </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, the special committee's chairman, indicated at a news conference that he and some other panel members personally were opposed to abortion but did not let that enter into their decision to recommend that the government not stand in the way of using legally obtained fetal remains for research. Defending the panel against allegations from anti-abortionists that the makeup of the panel was stacked in favor of allowing the research, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> told reporters that an examination of his opinions as a judge would show that he was `` very concerned about abortion'' himself. `` I did n't know how I was going to vote until I had heard the testimony,'' said <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, who was one of the 19. Dr. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, head of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at <LOCATION> Brigham </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, acknowledged that the fundamental question of the morality of abortion was a factor. `` It seemed to me that the abortion question was in the background, hovering over us all the time,'' said <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, chairman of the scientific issues portion of the committee deliberations. `` But I thought the panelists were so intellectually honest with themselves that they made every effort to divorce the abortion question ... wherever possible from the question of whether you could use the product of abortion. `` I think that was really the key of the entire three-day discussion: Could you divorce the two. Some people think you can not. `` I suspect that most of the people on the panel believed honestly ... that you could, with necessary safeguards, make a cleavage between the two questions.'' Sensitive to those concerns, the committee extensively discussed what type of safeguards should be recommended. Indeed, the discussion ran so long, the panel will meet again before completing its work and forwarding its formal, written recommendations to a standing <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> advisory committee by Dec. 1. It did agree that `` a pregnant woman should not be induced to terminate pregnancy in order to furnish fetal tissue for transplantation or medical research.'' It said the mother's decision to have an abortion should be kept separate from her decision to allow the fetus to be used for research and that guidelines must be drawn to avoid commercialization of fetal tissue. As part of those fundamental safeguards, it said anonymity should be maintained between the donor and recipient so there would not be a temptation for a woman to have what was referred to in discussions as a `` custom pregnancy'' and abortion in an effort to provide tissue that might be implanted in a relative with Parkinson's or some other disease. The committee members responded cautiously to reports that White House adviser <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>, a staunch opponent of abortion and distributor of the draft executive order that would ban fetal tissue research, has suggested that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> might make a decision that runs counter to the committee's recommendations, perhaps even before they are finalized. `` Because it's an election year, I think it's very difficult to comment on why people do what they do,'' said <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>. Nonetheless, he said, it would `` fly in the face of the usefulness'' of appointing the committee in the first place if a decision was to be made before it made its recommendations.

<TEXT>
 Five days after Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> pounded this <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island, life for hundreds of thousands of residents has been reduced to finding clean water, something to eat and a dry place to sleep. A state of emergency was in effect today in disaster areas, where nearly half the nation's 2.3 million people live. At least 26 people died on this island as the storm, which forecasters called the most intense on record, swept across the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> peninsula this week before heading for the northern Mexican coast. A half million Jamaicans were left homeless by <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> after it hit the island's east coast, and 80 percent of the country's 500,000 homes were severely damaged or destroyed Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> told a news conference Friday that food stamps would soon be distributed to those most in need. The state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Jamaica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reported that to prevent the spread of disease, the government was trying to move people out of refugee shelters and back to their homes, if the homes had not been destroyed. On Friday, work crews covered roofless government buildings with plastic sheets, replaced snapped utility poles and cleared streets of debris. The <ORGANIZATION> Jamaica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> broadcast health bulletins urging people to boil their water. Children bathed with soap at an open water hydrant in downtown <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION>, and people filled plastic jugs at a burst water main. Many people stood in long lines to get into grocery stores guarded by helmeted soldiers and dogs. Women and children balanced large water containers on their heads or waited patiently in line to fill cans of cooking kerosene. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> devastated what was already a weak economy with one out of four workers unemployed. The banana and poultry industries were destroyed and tourism, the No. 1 foreign exchange earner, faced an uncertain future. One bright spot was a report by Minister of Mining and Tourism <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> that the main aluminum and bauxite plants received little or no damage. The minerals are among <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'s major exports. <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON>, who estimated total damage from the storm at $ 8 billion, said reconstruction would require `` the largest-scale international assistance we have ever mobilized'' _ from $ 300 million to $ 400 million worth. On Friday, emergency relief supplies had already arrived from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and other countries, and nearly all of <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> neighbors pledged assistance. The state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Jamaica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Air </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamaica </PERSON> and other carriers agreed to airlift supplies from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> free of charge. <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> invoked emergency powers by declaring much of the island a disaster area Thursday night. He ordered the immediate reopening of gasoline stations and stores that sell vital supplies. <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> also imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew to prevent looting. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sent a letter to <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> expressing his and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s `` deepest sympathy for the tragic loss of life'' from the storm, said presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will play an active role in helping <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> rebuild for a bright and prosperous future,'' said the letter. <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> canceled its `` Come Back to <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'' television commercials Thursday, but travel agents in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> reported that many people who had booked tours to the island were still planning to go. <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> was quoted by <ORGANIZATION> Jamaica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> as saying that damage to `` four or five'' hotels had been reported and they had closed temporarily. Others were operating with limited services, he said. In <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, military ruler Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> issued a brief statement Friday night expressing sympathy with Haitian victims of <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>. Ten people drowned when their boat sank Sunday night off the southern coast of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. The government declared a state of emergency in three southern departments. In the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, where the storm caused flooding and widespread damage to crops, five had been reported dead. The <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, which also was in the hurricane's path, reported very minor damage, with 51 homeless out of total population of 23,000. Phones in some areas still out of order Friday and thousands of trees were blown down, but no significant damage was done to buildings.

 <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear plant officials say preparations for low-power testing will begin immediately following a vote by the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to clear a major obstacle toward a long-delayed license. But <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> foes, including <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, declared Friday that the fight to stop the $ 5.6 billion reactor from operating is far from over. `` The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> _ the <ORGANIZATION> Not </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> _ is experiencing a meltdown in its thinking process,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic presidential nominee, who has played an important role in stalling <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>. The ruling, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in a prepared statement, `` defies logic and brings new meaning to the word ` irresponsible.''' The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> on Friday voted 4-0 for a rules `` clarification'' that will allow nuclear plants to receive low-power permits without an emergency siren system in place to alert neighbors within 10 miles of the reactors of an atomic emergency. But the commission left open the question of whether <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s owners are financially qualified to conduct the tests <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION>, the main owner of <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>, filed for bankruptcy reorganization last January. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION>, the utility's <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> division, hailed the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> action on the rule change as `` another major step forward for <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> will require about five weeks of preparation before the plant would be ready to begin testing at up to 5 percent power. He estimated that the license could take another four weeks, and that tests could begin two weeks after that. Asked whether <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> was rushing to start testing before the November election since <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is one of the plant's key opponents, he said the timing is `` pure coincidence.'' The lone regulatory obstacle remaining for <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s low-power license is a petition filed by plant opponents charging that the reactor's owners are financially unfit to operate the plant. That question was tentatively scheduled for an <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> vote following the siren issue, but was postponed. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> predicted that a final agreement will be in place within several weeks to cover payments being skipped by the owner of the fourth largest <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> share, <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wholesale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. He described that agreement as a permanent arrangement, but under questioning acknowledged that it would provide funding only sometime into 1990. Asked what would happen then, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said, `` If we're not in commercial operation at that point, we'll have to face up to it at that point.'' The idle $ 5.6 billion reactor is losing $ 50 million each month in maintenance and finance costs. To critics who complain that low-power operation could be allowed without warning sirens in place, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said, `` There is no hazard to public safety from low-power testing _ absolutely none.'' But opponents denounced the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> vote as weakening protections to the public. `` The decision again shows the Reagan-Bush administration is so blindly committed to getting <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> on line that public protection does n't matter,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., in a statement `` Its goal is to get this plant plugged in and turned on before Nov. 8 so that no one can turn it off later,'' <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lando </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> responded that the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s vote `` has nothing to do with the presidential election. ... I think the Nuclear Regulatory Commision is acting within its authority, acting responsibly.'' In his statement, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the ruling comes at a time when no adequate evacuation plan has been prepared to protect residents near the plant, which lies just north of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> border. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wo n't submit a plan for <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> communities within 10 miles of <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>. Plant owners have developed their own plan for <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> held a news conference in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and vowed `` to take every action possible including going to the federal court to stop low-power licensing.''

 Insurance disaster teams armed with a truckload of computer equipment, claim forms and blank checks left for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> as <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> braced for heavy losses from Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>. The nation's largest home insurer sent about 60,000 blank checks, 88 personal computers, 50 rooms of office furniture, 20 copy machines, 12 generators and enough paper folders and claim forms to handle 100,000 claims to south <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> in anticipation of extensive storm damage. `` It's a sizable operation and it's something we've done before so we're ready,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> at company headquarters in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>. `` We have 500 people around the country on stand-by duty ready to move in as soon as possible after the storm to handle claims.'' An office in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> will serve as the staging area for <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION>'s disaster team and 37 people were setting up earlier this week as the hurricane ripped across the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. The storm, however, weakened considerably after it hit the <LOCATION> Texas-Mexico </LOCATION> coastline and headed north today. The staff at the nerve center will mushroom to 260 by the middle of next week as <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> agents, claim adjusters and managers begin settling claims. Most insurance companies, including <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION>, stopped writing storm-damage coverage by Wednesday morning. And homeowners gave up the idea of buying new flood insurance after learning that a new policy would not take effect for five days. <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON> said space has been rented in seven coastal hotels for emergency offices and phone lines already have been installed in some locations. `` We've got some office furniture and phones in place but most of its is being held back in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> until after the storm passes,'' <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON> said. `` As soon as possible after the storm, we'll move in start processing claims. Generators are sent because power often is knocked out for long periods of time due to large storms. The company sent a handfull of cellular phones to ensure communication lines remain open and even 25 floor fans were sent to keep computer equipment ventilated. Losses were expected to be heavy in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where State Farm is the largest single insurer of homes, <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON> said. In the <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> area, the most heavily hit, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> insures about 8 percent of all homes. `` We think this storm will not be as bad Hurricane <PERSON> Alicia </PERSON> in 1983 which hit <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON> said. `` In that storm, we paid $ 150 million in claims. It was the worst storm we ever had. But we'll still have quite a few claims this time.''

 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said today it was up to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to decide whether to maintain or pull out their bases in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> was responding to an offer Friday by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to abandon a strategic naval base in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would abandon its bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. `` That is for the two superpowers to discuss and to talk about,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> told reporters at the presidential palace. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> made the offer in a speech in which he outlined a seven-point plan for defusing tension in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. His call came against a backdrop of growing opposition to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Earlier today, Sen. <PERSON> Leticia </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahani </PERSON> belittled <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s pullout offer, saying the Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military facilities were not `` comparable. Ms. <PERSON> Shahani </PERSON>, chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-run </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> were `` far bigger complexes'' than the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s base at <LOCATION> Cam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitra </PERSON>, speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> said: `` It is us -LRB- Filipinos -RRB- who will chart our own foreign policy.'' But his deputy <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuenco </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s offer was a `` sound proposal.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said Friday said she hoped the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could resolve their differences in talks over the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases despite a deadlock over compensation and other issues. She said Filipino Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>, who is in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> were trying to narrow differences `` so I'm hoping they will.'' On Thursday, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wanted to keep <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, <PERSON> Subic </PERSON> and four other installations in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> but that <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s demands for more money were too high. `` There are alternatives which we are having now to examine,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said shortly after meeting with <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>, chief of the Philippine panel in the stalled bases talks that began in April. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is considering moving the bases to Guam or other sites. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pays about $ 180 million a year for use of the six bases. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> has said the Americans have offered about $ 502 million in compensation but added the $ 1.2 billion annual Phillipine demand is `` reasonable.'' <PERSON> Cam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranh </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON> is the Soviets' major naval deployment base abroad, while <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and <PERSON> Subic </PERSON> are the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'s largest foreign bases. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says its bases are essential to prevent Soviet military expansion in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. About 40,000 troops, military dependents and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> civilians are stationed at the six bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, which employ about 42,000 Filipinos. Annual salaries to Filipino civilians total more than $ 83 million, the second largest payroll after the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government.

 Worried Soviet space officials are considering changes in training for their cosmonauts after a capsule stranded in orbit last week, the director of the program said. `` We altogether, including the <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the cosmonauts and engineers, were a bit complacent about our life and maybe our preparedness got a bit lower _ our preparedness for functions in unexpected situations that can always emerge in any flight,'' <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shatalov </PERSON> told reporters Friday. But <PERSON> Shatalov </PERSON> told reporters that `` nothing teaches us more than the difficulties we encounter in life.'' Cosmonauts <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohmand </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and veteran Soviet spaceman <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyakhov </PERSON> were stranded in orbit for 26 tense hours on Sept. 6 because of equipment and crew problems on their Soyuz TM-5 capsule. After two unsuccessful attempts to reenter the atmosphere, the capsule landed safely in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> as food and oxygen ran dangerously low. The two cosmonauts, <PERSON> Shatalov </PERSON> and other space scientists faced a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> news conference Friday to assess the problems of the flight. `` I think that after this flight all the experts in space technology, the <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and training center will make many useful conclusions that will be realized in changes in the design, logic of management, documentation and equipment of the center, in the organizational structure and probably in the methods of cosmonauts' training,'' said <PERSON> Shatalov </PERSON>. Before the capsule was stranded in space, it docked with the Mir orbiting space station, where it left off a doctor who is to monitor the health of two cosmonauts conducting experiments there since December. After the capsule undocked from the Mir and was preparing to return to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, a sensor in the Soyuz's guidance system failed to fire an engine that slows down the capsule so it can safely enter the atmosphere. On a second attempt, the braking engine fired under automatic control, but shut itself down. <PERSON> Lyakhov </PERSON> admitted to reporters last week that he had made mistakes, such as improperly restarting the engine after the second failed attempt. But he did not refer to the mistake at Friday's briefing <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunayev </PERSON>, chief of the space agency <ORGANIZATION> Glavkosmos </ORGANIZATION>, said mission control also erred when it did not make a necessary adjustment to control the speed of the descent. The problem was diagnosed and resolved, he said, but `` you can see we made a certain mistake in control and those mistakes should be liquidated.'' <PERSON> Shatalov </PERSON> said Friday that the stranded capsule could have made an emergency landing at various sites in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. But he said the return to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> was postponed to give mission control and the cosmonauts time to set up the landing at the planned Soviet site, where ground crews were waiting to assist the cosmonauts after touchdown. <PERSON> Dunayev </PERSON> said the Soviets hope to launch an unmanned space shuttle this year but want to be completely certain of a successful mission before a launch is scheduled.

 This partially evacuated city, spared the worst of Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, became a windsurfers' paradise as crowds turned out to ride the blustery skirts of the giant storm Boarded-up buildings and empty streets made much of <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION> seem abandoned, but <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Drive </LOCATION> was jammed with traffic jam Friday as residents and tourists flocked to the seawall after word that <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> would hit farther to the south than expected. Scores of cars cruised up and down the windy beachfront road, as bicyclists, joggers and windsurfers were joined by crowds of residents complaining of cabin fever in their boarded-up homes. `` This is definitely the advanced class,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, a legal investigator who took her sailboard into 35-mph winds here after fleeing Port Isabel. Her biggest danger was the parking lot beside the beach. `` I was so excited when I got here and saw the waves that I slipped down on the pavement,'' she said, rolling up her wetsuit to display a small gash on her shin. `` This is what we wait all year for.'' `` This definitely rates a ` 10'. But it's also a good day for conservative, positive sailing,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Corpus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christi </ORGANIZATION> architect <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, one of about a half-dozen windsurfers who rode high tides at 4 feet above normal levels. `` I was sitting in the house with the windows boarded up, getting kind of bored,'' said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. `` I decided I'd just get out here and see what the winds were like.'' Many of the residents and tourists who decided to stay had heard repeated warnings that <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> would likely turn toward the north, striking land near <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> and bashing Corpus Christi with heavy wind and rain. But when the hurricane stayed on its course toward <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the seawall swelled with confident crowds, despite warnings of flash floods. `` Most people probably would n't expect to see this many people down here in a hurricane, but once you've lived in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION> for a while, you come to expect the unusual out of the residents,'' said <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Roland </PERSON>, who was enjoying his daily bicycle ride along the seawall. For a lot of the natives here it's seen as kind of a sign of bravado, <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> said. `` We do n't have this many people out here on an average day during the summer,'' he said. Families gathered along the seawall as the waves lapped at the concrete steps, and children danced along the edge of the churning water, mugging for cameras. Many, including <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiter </PERSON>, said they just grew tired of sitting inside a house darkened by plywood-covered windows. `` I think everybody is just bored, and this is kind of a release from being cooped up,'' he said. `` You can only take that sort of thing so long before you start getting stir crazy.''

 The late A.L. <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON>, a native Texan who later lived in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, was 18 in September 1900 when a hurricane struck <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> just before midnight, killing 6,000 people. It was the worst natural disaster in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. Here's his account of that storm, as written, from his journal of some years later: It was on a Saturday and the wind was blowing from the south, coming in from the Gulf and gradually increasing its velocity as the day wore on. I and one or two of my brothers were cutting red-top cane by hand and standing it in large round shocks. ... The clouds come up about the middle of the morning and got thicker as the hours passed, and about 3:30 in the afternoon I could head a deep low sound of thunder in the southeast and as it slowly come close and closer, the very ground that I stood on would vibrate for long periods. And the wind was increasing, and the clouds looked nearly as black as bellows of coal smoke and -LRB- were -RRB- down close to the tree tops. All birds stopped their singing and no cricket or frog made any sound, just the wind and the continued sound of heavy thunder is all that you could hear. There is a helpless feeling that accompanies any real storm cloud for all of nature's life of low or high cast. ... -LRB- one has -RRB- no idea just how unimportant and small and helpless a storm can make anyone feel, and this storm on that September day is the darkest of my memory. The waves come over the -LRB- 50-foot -RRB- seawalls ... -LRB- and -RRB- all was confusion. You could hear screams for help and the prayers and cries of the drowning above the sound of the thunders and rolling billows of the deep as they come in and over the entire town. In one of the higher buildings ... the third floor held the central telephone switchboard, and the girls on duty stayed until the water come through the windows and then all soon was washed out into the tempest of surging water. Timbers, trees, logs, houses, people, horses, cattle, hogs, dogs and chickens, turkeys and other animals and fowls was all mixed in those waves as they come in and swept back out to sea, carrying in their undercurrent everything that was caught as they boiled up over and down and under, then back to repeat the same action over and over for 12 to 14 hours. There was a Society Ball held on the third floor of a brick building. They danced and sang and prayed, cried and screamed but the music continued until the waves come through the windows and all -LRB- were -RRB- taken. -LRB- When daylight finally came, `` a death-shrouded dawn,'' he was in the water. -RRB- There was a young woman bobbed up right near holding to a heavy timber with one hand and under the other arm she held a baby or a small child, and soon as she could she cried for help. I was near on a timber or timbers that seemed to be the wood ceiling of a large room. I could almost reach out and catch them, but ... as I was about to get a good hold, the bottom fell out of where we was and everything went down and down. But I still stayed with my timbers and when I come to the surface again and got the salt water out of my face and eyes, I looked in every direction, and by the flashes of lightning I saw my young lady again, but she was not close and she did not have that child. ... Very soon there was a mountain of water between she was and me ... and I never seen her any more to know it.

 For six couples, the memories of a Jamaican vacation will include flying debris, quivering buildings, water sloshing in toilet bowls and ocean foam splashing at their hotel windows. The couples from <LOCATION> Fernandina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, whose four-day holiday began as a lark, were among thousands of travelers trapped on the island by Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, one of the century's most violent storms. `` You could n't see the ground from our room three stories above,'' <ORGANIZATION> Jan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabors </ORGANIZATION>, one of the group, recalled Thursday. `` You could n't see three or four feet in front of you on the balcony.'' In <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, where winds reached 175 mph, an estimated 500,000 people were left homeless and at least 26 were reported dead from <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, which passed directly over the island Monday. The <LOCATION> Fernandina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> couples attempted to leave <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> on Sunday from <LOCATION> Montego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, but high winds had already canceled the flights. The tourists were told they would be evacuated from Sandal's <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caribbean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> to a more secure structure The next day, the group was taken by bus to join about 1,500 tourists taking refuge at the <LOCATION> Wyndham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION>, a seven-story structure about 300 feet from the ocean. `` The air was white'' with foam blown from the sea, tourist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Burbank </PERSON> said. `` On the ocean side, windows were being blown out,'' said Mrs. <ORGANIZATION> Nabors </ORGANIZATION>' husband, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON>. Some of the group began to move out into the hotel hallways to hide from flying glass if their windows burst, they said. At one point the windows in another room burst, the door was blown off the hinges and the hallway walls began to lean inward from the force of the wind, <ORGANIZATION> Nabors </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We saw the wall buckling in and when it started doing that, we moved on down to the end of the hallway.

<TEXT>
 Federal officials have overcome major legal obstacles in their case against <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and it is now likely they will ask a federal grand jury to indict the former <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> president for fraud, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. However, the indictment is expected to deal only with accusations of wrongdoing after <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> left office in February 1986, the newspaper said. The case was narrowed to overcome doubts about whether <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law could apply to the deposed president's alleged efforts to misappropriate billions of dollars in <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> taxpayers' funds, according to anonymous sources cited by the newspaper. The indictment, anticipated for months, has been delayed by a number of circumstances. Acting Associate Attorney General <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> expressed reservations at one point about the quality of the case when draft charges were brought before him. The investigation is now focusing on allegations that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, conspired with Saudi Arabian financier <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> and others to violate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> district court injunctions. They allegedly secretly transferred ownership of hundreds of millions of dollars in stolen art and <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> real estate bought with <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government funds. Court records in related civil lawsuits allege that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> took control of the funds while he was still in power but used elaborate schemes involving front companies and agents to hide his ownership and liquidate properties after he went into exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. The inter-agency <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which became more prominent in the wake of the diplomatically embarrassing attempt to prosecute Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on federal drug charges in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, helped settle problems with the legal case early in the week, the Times said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, along with his staff, outlined details of proposed criminal charges against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> at a White House meeting of the review group Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not attend. Intelligence advisers are expected next week to offer their opinions on how the case could affect foreign relations. In a statement issued from the Philippine embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Severina </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, general counsel for his government's <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Good Government, said: `` There has been considerable skepticism in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> about President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s willingness to approve the indictment of Mr. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> ... If he approves it, Filipinos everywhere will applaud Mr. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and the American system of justice that applies the full force of the law to corrupt dictators who violate <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. laws.'' However, some concern has been expressed that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> may flee to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> or another country because the indictment is imminent, a source told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>.

 Mayor <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Peve </PERSON> and two members of the village board have quit in a pig-headed dispute over pork sandwiches and control of a town festival. A third village board member is threatening to resign after a board meeting this week failed to resolve questions about who should monitor the annual Lafayette Reunion Days. `` I'm done. I'm through being called names and having people wave their fists in my face,'' said <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> <PERSON> Peve </PERSON>. The dispute concerns an ordinance empowering the village board to oversee the activities of a committee that organizes summer festivals. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, president of this year's organizing group, the <ORGANIZATION> Reunion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the three-day festival in August was a success and drew more than 1,500 visitors to the town of 277. But <PERSON> Peve </PERSON> insists the committee needs to be monitored, and some of the loudest squealing concerned the mayor's allegation that the committee slaughtered several hogs and sold pork sandwiches without having the meat properly inspected. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovins </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> said meat products must be inspected before being sold. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, who noted communities commonly slaughter hogs for fairs, said his only mistake was in not asking people to make a donation for the sandwiches instead of buying them. `` This town is supposed to be a community of little helpers, but some members of the board got pigheaded and decided to play God and butt into our business,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Another Wet Weekend Expected In Yellowstone</HEAD>

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Firefighters looked forward to another wet and cool weekend in Yellowstone National Park, but elsewhere across the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> forest fires continued to rage under the whip of shifting winds. The fires that have affected half of the park's 2.2 million acres stayed within containment lines although flames shot through the park on Friday, with temperatures increasing to the mid-60s and steady winds approaching 35 mph, authorities said. Today's forecast called for a chance of light snowshowers this afternoon and temperatures in the 50s. Heavy winds also were expected, but park spokeswoman <PERSON> Sonya </PERSON> <PERSON> Capek </PERSON> said the high humidity and cool temperatures would keep the fires down. Firefighters in Glacier National Park in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> were not as lucky Friday. About 200 firefighters were forced to retreat from a blaze after winds gusting to 40 mph pushed a wall of fire past containment lines. `` It was just an incredible show,'' fire information officer <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Berns </PERSON> said of the 300-feet high flames. Shifting winds pushed the 34,500-acre fire up a drainage along the northeast flank where crews were reconstructing lines that blew out Thursday, <PERSON> Berns </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, officials were throwing all available manpower and equipment at a wilderness fire in the north-central Gospel Hump Wilderness as wildfires continued to burn in most of the state's national forests `` I do n't know if we're over the hump as far as the fire season goes, but we've been saying we're guardedly optimistic,'' said <PERSON> Sandi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sacher </PERSON>, an information officer at the <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Fires that have consumed more than 190,000 acres remained out of control and outside wilderness boundaries in the <LOCATION> Nez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Perce </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Challis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Salmon </PERSON> national forests, she said. Firefighters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, meanwhile, contained three large fires that have charred more than 70,000 acres. In <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, 30 Canadian firefighters arrived Friday to help battle the flames burning within nearly 1.2 million acres of the 2.2 million-acre park. The `` helitak'' group was the first Canadian crew to arrive on scene since the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> accepted that country's offer to help. The experienced firefighters are a first-attack group, which fights flames from a helicopter, <PERSON> Capek </PERSON> said. This past week, firefighters took advantage of the wet cold weather to strengthen existing lines around fires and extend the lines. By Friday, 50 percent of the 335,500-acre North Fork fire, the most troublesome of the blazes in the park, had been contained. Officials believe the rain and snow that fell in the park had dampened fuels sufficiently so that only seven days of continued dry weather would bring back the tinder-dry conditions that allowed fires to grow by thousands of acres daily, said <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> <PERSON> Bungarz </PERSON>, North Fork fire incident commander. Officials predicted they would contain that blaze by mid-October. Military personnel were stationed on either side of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Highway 191, the fire's western edge, to keep it from jumping the road. `` If you put two hot shot crews in competition with each other, it's a situation of two plus two equals five,'' <PERSON> Bungarz </PERSON> said. `` I think the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> will react the same way.'' About 700 Marines from <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pendleton </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> arrived Friday, bringing the military force in the park up to 4,100. Fire information officer <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> said the Marines probably would be out on the fire lines today. In <LOCATION> Oakridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, a $ 5,000 reward was offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person responsible for starting a forest fire burning in the <ORGANIZATION> Willamette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. A fire patrol plane crew and witnesses have given fire investigators solid leads about vehicles seen in the area when the blaze was only about an acre in size, forest officials said. The fire had grown to 7,300 acres Friday, but <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials predicted it would be contained by next week and controlled by the end of the month.

<HEAD>Government Presents Kurds Who Support Baghdad, Condemn Rebels</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSUL, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, trying to counter charges it used poison gas against its Kurdish minority, brought foreign correspondents to the heart of <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION> and paraded Kurds who denounced the rebels and praised <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The local Kurds denied the government used poison gas against them, and scorned the rebels who fled to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> last month. `` If one of them comes, I would drink his blood like water. They are the traitors of our country,'' <PERSON> Naima </PERSON> <PERSON> Khader </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> told reporters Friday in <LOCATION> Sulaymaniyah </LOCATION>. She said her husband died fighting the rebels in 1985. Around her were dozens of other relatives of Kurds killed by insurgents, many holding pictures of their loved ones. The Iraqi government, infuriated by mounting Western charges that it used poison gas to crush Kurdish insurgents, arranged the one-day trip for journalists to show the accusations were baseless. Journalists from the around the world were flown by jetliner Friday from <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> to the oil center of <LOCATION> Kirkuk </LOCATION>. There they boarded Soviet MI-8 helicopters and flew to <LOCATION> Sulaymaniyah </LOCATION>, then on to <LOCATION> Mosul </LOCATION> by dusk. There was also a side trip by bus to meet Kurdish refugees who had accepted an amnesty program in Arbat, near <LOCATION> Sulaymaniyah </LOCATION>. Government officials in green uniforms hovered over each interview and helped translate some Kurdish to Arabic and then to English. They often cut off talks after a few minutes to rush reporters on to the next engagement. At a new cinder block village, a group of Kurds greeted the journalists, chanting: `` With blood and soul we sacrifice ourselves for you <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON>,'' referring to President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>. Officials said the group came `` from dirty villages,'' but several of them said they had moved from the city of <LOCATION> Sulaymaniyeh </LOCATION> to take advantage of free houses. The towns themselves were busy, full of Kurdish men in sashed, baggy trousers and distinctive head scarves. But the view during the helicopter flight from <LOCATION> Sulaymaniyah </LOCATION> appeared to confirm reports that the government is relocating many Kurds from remote villages into new concrete housing complexes and destroying old settlements. Reporters saw several new housing complexes laid out in geometric order near highways on the Kurdish plain. There were few if any villages of the traditional style visible from the air, and dozens appeared demolished. A few were scorched with fire. On Thursday, Defense Minister <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Khairallah </PERSON> said villagers were being relocated away from the border for security reasons and also to provide them with improved services. None of the Kurds brought forward by the government accused Iraqi officials of knocking down villages. `` The rebels used to burn the villages and take the families away,'' said <PERSON> Majid </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> in Arbat. Camp officials said more than 4,200 Kurds had returned to the Arbat center, about 56 miles from the border with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, to take advantage of the amnesty announced by the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> government last week. The government has said previously that more than 11,500 Kurds have sought amnesty. In a separate development, a spokesman for the Kurdish rebels claimed that 2,400 Kurdish civilians trapped in a mountain ravine were killed in a poison gas attack Aug. 30 by <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes. Word of the alleged slaughter was delayed because it took the handful of Kurds who survived the attack 10 days to reach southern <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and contact rebel officials, the spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Kurdistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> reported in a telephone interview with The Associated Press in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the victims were fleeing an Iraqi military offensive by trekking to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. He claimed the casualties raised the number of Kurds killed by Iraqi chemical weapons since early August to around 4,300. The official also said that <ORGANIZATION> Kurdistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas, battling an estimated 60,000 Iraqi troops pushing into rebel-held mountains in northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, killed 140 in a major clash several days ago.

<TEXT>
 Actress <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> was awarded $ 1.85 million and a share of the profits from the show `` Valerie'' by a jury that found the Lorimar production company acted in bad faith in firing her. The jury foreman said the message of Friday's verdict was, `` You just have to treat people fairly.'' Miss <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> said she felt `` vindicated, gratified, thrilled'' with the verdict, which her lawyer said could earn the actress up to $ 15 million. `` The truth did prevail,'' she told reporters. `` We won financially. We won morally. I do n't see any loss of any kind.'' The Superior Court jury spent nearly a month hearing evidence and took 4 -LCB- days to reach a complex verdict that required them to answer more than 30 questions. <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telepictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which produces the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> series, originally sued <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>, claiming she breached her contract by quitting the show. A countersuit by the actress and her husband contended she was wrongfully fired in August 1987. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and individual producers were dropped from that suit during trial. The jury found that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>, her husband, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cacciotti </PERSON>, and their company, <ORGANIZATION> AV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION>, had lived up to their contracts with <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON>. But they said <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> acted `` in bad faith, without a reasonable basis or probable cause'' by firing the actress. Jurors believed that <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> witnesses lied when they said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> was out to `` submarine the show,'' said the jury foreman, postal worker <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> <PERSON> McDaniels </PERSON>. The firm should not have held a crucial meeting in Miss <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>'s absence before firing her, he said `` The television business is just like any other business,'' <PERSON> McDaniels </PERSON> said. `` You have good and bad. This verdict does n't condemn the TV industry You just have to treat people fairly.'' The panel awarded the $ 1.85 million in general damages for lost wages, but declined to award punitive damages to Miss <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> and her husband, who was a supervising producer on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> series. Miss <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> also was granted a 12 -LCB- percent share of adjusted gross profits for the 1987-88 season, including fees for syndication of the show. Her contract would have run through 1991. Her attorney, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Langberg </PERSON>, said the share of the gross profits could bring the actress $ 10 million to $ 15 million in the long run. <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Engel </PERSON>, expressed relief that punitive damages were not awarded. `` It could have been worse,'' he said, adding that an appeal was unlikely because `` the verdict is so small.'' But <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Brogliatti </PERSON> disagreed. `` We're disappointed in the verdict,'' she said `` And our attorney has advised us there are grounds for an appeal and we are considering it.'' Some of the jurors lined up in the hallway after delivering their verdict to get Miss <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>'s autograph. At the trial, the company claimed that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> was emotionally unstable and menopausal, a position she denounced Friday as `` sexist.'' <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> replaced Miss <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> on the show, which was retitled `` The <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> Family.

 Several hundred thousand anti-government protesters took to the streets of the capital today to demand democracy, and troops opened fire on a crowd surrounding government buildings, wounding at least three. Most of the protesters today marched peacefully in lines through the streets of the capital, some carrying placards that read: `` If we do n't get it, we will hit out.'' But a violent scene developed around the <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> building, where troops opened fire to disperse an angry crowd. At least three people were wounded. The sound of gunfire attracted a much larger crowd, and many threatened to burn down the building. <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks intervened before the threats could be carried out. Soon after, a group of students clambered over adjacent rooftops to break into the Ministry building. It was not immediately clear whether the students remained in the building or had been persuaded to leave. Protesters also surrounded two other nearby government buildings, <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. Shooting was heard in the area but it could not immediately be determined who was involved. Troops had not been reported to fire on anti-government protesters since mid-August. About 100 soldiers were posted at both the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and City Hall but only a few were at the Trade Ministry. Today's protests indicated that the population of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, the nation's capital, was unsatisfied with yet another concession by the government. State radio announced Friday that all military personnel and civil servants must resign from the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and refrain from membership in all future political parties. The decision, the radio said, was made at the recommendation of a recently formed election commission which is to supervise multi-party elections in about three months. The opposition has rejected this move, saying an interim government must be formed before elections take place. About two-thirds of the 2.5 million members of the ruling party come from military and civil service ranks. Some opposition leaders, who are believed to be negotiating with President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s government, have been attempting to stop mob violence from escalating. On Friday, prominent dissident <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> defused a potentially bloody confrontation between soldiers and more than 100,000 demonstrators moving on the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> armed with spears, swords and knives. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, a former brigadier general, asked the crowd to `` fight without bloodshed.'' `` We can not blame these soldiers for the faults of some of their commanders,'' he told the crowd. `` Soldiers are born of the people. They are the people's army.'' One Burmese intellectual who watched the confrontation said of the protesters: `` They do n't seem to be afraid of the guns. They are angry and frustrated.'' Interviews with a number of <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> government employees today also indicated that a government warning that all civil servants return to work by Sept. 26 or face official action would go unheeded. Virtually all government employees, including some police and military personnel, have been on strike since Aug. 8, causing an almost total administrative breakdown. Massive protests began after strongman Ne Win, who seized power in 1962, resigned last July. His replacement, hardliner <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, attempted to restore order by ordering the military to fire at the swelling number of protestors but resigned 17 days later. On Aug. 19, the relatively moderate <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> became <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s first civilian leader in a quarter century, but he has also been unable to stop the nationwide uprising

<TEXT>
 About 100 radical students took to the city's streets today in an anti-Olympic protest on the Games' opening day, and police arrested about a dozen of them, witnesses said The students marched from a shopping center toward <LOCATION> Myongdong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cathedral </LOCATION>, shouting `` Oppose single-host Olympics!'' and `` Down with military dictatorship!'' witnesses said. Soon after the march began, about 100 plainclothes police charged the demonstration and arrested about a dozen protesters, the witnesses said. No tear gas was fired and no injuries reported, they said, speaking on condition of anonymity. It was the first known anti-Olympic street demonstration in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> in recent weeks. Most student protests have been carried out on university campuses. Radical students, who form a small minority in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, are demanding that the Olympics be shared with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to help unify the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, which was divided at the end of World War II in 1945. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> boycotted the Olympics after its demand to co-host the Games was turned down by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>.

 The biggest athletic show on earth opened today with a record number of nearly 10,000 Olympic athletes from 160 countries marching under a massive security blanket and the jealous glare of communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. A colorful, 3 -LCB- - hour spectacle mixing ancient Korean rituals with space-age technology kicked off 16 days of athletic competition at the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Summer Games The Games will provide a showcase for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and produce the first all-out East-West gold rush since the 1976 Montreal Games. `` I'm glad the sky is so high and so blue,'' <PERSON> Yuk </PERSON> <PERSON> Hee-Jin </PERSON>, a 17-year-old Korean high school student, said on entering the stadium. `` I believe <PERSON> God </PERSON> is blessing my country for its years of hard work and preparations for the Olympic Games.'' After mutual boycotts of the 1980 <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and 1984 Los Angeles Games, Soviet bloc and Western athletes strode into <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s sun-washed Olympic Stadium in closed ranks to the tumultuous roar of a sellout crowd of 70,000 On the streets of downtown <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> meanwhile, police arrested about a dozen radical students today for mounting an anti-Olympic protest, witnesses said. But no tear gas was fired to quell the protest and no injuries were reported. At least a billion others watched the Olympics via a 115-nation, worldwide television hookup. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> alone paid $ 300 million for television rights to the Games, which cost the South Korean hosts $ 3.1 billion for stadiums, arenas and various support facilities, all of which were in place well before the start of the Games. By decree of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, North Korean television was blacked out. The communist nation had demanded to co-host the Games, but Olympic officials said only one nation can do so. Superlatives of the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Games included: the most athletes -LRB- 9,633 -RRB-, the most countries -LRB- 20 more than at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> -RRB-, the most gold medals -LRB- 237 -RRB- and the most venues -LRB- 34 for 23 official sports and three demonstration sports -RRB-. Communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> sparked a mini-boycott that failed to sway its biggest political allies, including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Of the countries following <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s boycott, only <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> ranked as a sports power, while <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> had hopes in the marathon. Both also boycotted the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Games. The other no-shows _ <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Seychelles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> _ are not regarded as major sports nations. On the eve of the opening ceremonies, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> again displayed its wrath, saying in an official <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> statement that South Korean President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s call for a `` successful opening of the Olympics ... will help intensify the fascist rule, increase the danger of war and mean tolerating the schemes to perpetuate the division of the nation.'' Similar criticism of the Games has come from student radicals in the south, hundreds of whom staged scattered anti-Olympic, anti-government, and anti-U.S. demonstrations in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> as the Olympic torch arrived in the capital Friday. But none of the demonstrations came near the heavily guarded Olympic facilities or the torch procession. They also failed to arouse popular support. In one protest at the <ORGANIZATION> Kookmin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, about 300 students burned an effigy of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as well as a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag. But the anti-Americanism of the radical students found no echo in the Olympic stadium, where the crowd gave one of its loudest accolades to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team. For <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, the Games offered a worldwide showcase for its emergence from a developing country to an Asian industrial power whose exports include computers, automobiles and super tankers. To guard against internal or external threats to the Games, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has marshalled a 120,000-man security force and placed its 650,000-member armed forces on heightened alert. Although not directly involved in Olympic security, the 40,000-member <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ground forces were placed on `` increased alert'' and a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> carrier task force patrolled off the coast. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has stressed the Games' theme of reconciliation and of `` Harmony and Progress'' _ a theme symbolized in the omnipresent South Korean flag at the center of which is a sunlike disc combining the opposing forces: the red <PERSON> Yin </PERSON> and the blue <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>. The strains of <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s Choral Symphony, lauding the brotherhood of man, resounded through the stadium as the procession of Olympic athletes got underway. From his box which appeared to be enclosed in bullet-proof glass, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> rose to declare the Games of the 24th Olympiad officially open. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, in line with its fundamental Islamic beliefs, was the only country in the procession to have a Korean man, not a woman, carry the signboard bearing its name. The first competitions scheduled for after the ceremony today were women's platform diving, soccer, men's volleyball, men's basketball, boxing and taekwondo, a demonstration sport at these Games The first gold medal was to be awarded Sunday morning in the women's air-rifle competition. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> were expected to garner the most medals. As a prelude to the Stadium ceremony today, a flotilla of nearly 400 boats sailed majestically on the nearby <LOCATION> Han </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, led by a dragon drum ship. The stadium extravaganza, involving 1,500 performers, blended taekwondo demonstrations, age-old Korean folk dances, electronic synthesizers, rock music and sky divers. It also provided the first suspense of the Games in the form of some white doves, who perched on the unlit Olympic torch basin as a platform carrying flame-bearers rose upwards. When the torch was lit, exploding into an inferno, the doves scattered, and it could not be determined if any were killed.

<HEAD>Attorney May Seek Genetic Tests Of Florida Girl In Baby-Swap Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An attorney may seek a court-ordered genetic test to determine if a 9 -LCB- - year-old <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> girl is the daughter of a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> couple who filed suit claiming a baby-switch conspiracy in 1978 <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellin </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> malpractice lawyer, said he will first ask the girl's father to allow his daughter to be tested, but will ask a court to mandate the test if he refuses, The <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The girl's father said he would not allow her to be tested and that they had the wrong child. The test would compare inherited factors in the girl's blood with the blood chemistry of <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> and <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Langhorne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>. The Twiggs are plaintiffs in a $ 100 million suit alleging three doctors and a nurse at <ORGANIZATION> Hardee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wauchula </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, switched their healthy baby girl with a child suffering from a congenital heart defect. The small hospital also was named as a defendant in the federal suit. Mrs. <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> said Friday she will seek custody of the girl if she turns out to be her daughter and if she is not happy and safe. The girl, whose mother died of cancer seven years ago, now lives with her father. <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON>, the child Mrs. <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> brought home from the hospital 10 years ago, died Aug. 23 at the <LOCATION> Deborah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heart </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Browns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. The Twiggs discovered that <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON>'s Type B blood made it unlikely she was their daughter since they have Type O blood. Sophisticated protein-matching tests at the <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immunogenetics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> also concluded the child was unrelated to the Twiggs. A third test known as `` genetic fingerprinting'' is scheduled to begin next week. The <PERSON> Twiggs </PERSON>, who have seven surviving children, moved from central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> two years ago. Using public records, the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petersburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it had located a blond, blue-eyed girl, the only other white girl reported born at <ORGANIZATION> Hardee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> at the time <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> gave birth, in a southwest <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> city. To protect the child, the paper did not identify her. Relatives of the girl discount the notion that she was part of a baby-swapping scheme. `` My sympathy goes out to those people,'' the girl's father said Thursday evening. `` They have every right to pursue their real child. -LRB- My daughter -RRB- is not their child. ... She will never be their child.'' The father told the newspaper he knew nothing of any baby swap. He would not disclose his daughter's blood type and said he would resist any attempts to draw the girl into the Twiggs' battle. The girl knows nothing of the search for her. `` Until they get an indictment or a conviction ... I have nothing to say,'' he said. `` I'm an innocent bystander.''

 Rains stopped today and waters receded further from the worst floods ever to hit <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, authorities said. Water-borne diseases killed at least 28 more people, raising the official death toll since flooding began in June to 932, officials said. The government's official count is generally considered too low. <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> newspapers estimate at least 1,888 people have died. Health officials said at least 57,881 cases of diarrhea have been reported nationwide in the epidemic that has broken out in the impoverished country of 110 million. At least 211 of those victims have died of diarrhea, caused by drinking contaminated water, said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity. An estimated 40 million people have been affected by the floods, which have inundated 53 of the country's 64 administrative districts. Rail links from the capital of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> to large towns such as <LOCATION> Chittagong </LOCATION>, the main port, and <LOCATION> Sylhet </LOCATION>, the business center, were restored Friday following major repairs to the railroad bridge at <LOCATION> Tongi </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>'s outskirts. The bridge was washed away by the flooded <LOCATION> Turag </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Tongi </LOCATION> two weeks ago. A senior <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said: `` We expect national highways and inter-district roads to be driveable by the beginning of next month, and rail communications to be functional in two weeks.'' Refugees fleeing the floods sought shelter in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, a city of 6 million people. More than 1 million flood victims are being fed and given shelter at municipal centers, officials said.

<TEXT>
 Survivors of a fishing boat accident spent 18 hours clutching to a small life raft trying to stave off disorienting hypothermia that caused the last victim to jump from the raft into the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. Five people survived, but four others died before being rescued Friday by <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> helicopters about 35 miles from the coast. Dr. <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Sewell </PERSON>, who treated some of the survivors, said some were in the life raft, some had hung onto the side and some clung to a bulkhead that became detached from the 45-foot tuna fishing charter boat Cougar as it sank. The last person to die was in the raft, <PERSON> Sewell </PERSON> said, but hypothermia apparently made him confused. `` He saw the helicopter and he got out of the raft and started swimming for it. He started taking off his life jacket,'' <PERSON> Sewell </PERSON> said. One of the survivors, <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON>, 41, spent the entire 18 hours in the water clinging to the side of the life raft, his relatives said. `` He thought he was going to die,'' said his son, <PERSON> Rocky </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON>. `` My dad's friend died in his arms.'' <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON> said his father told him all nine tied themselves together and took turns in the life raft. When a woman in the raft died, they tied her to the bulkhead and someone else took her place in the raft, he said. After their rescue, the survivors were taken to <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Communities </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, about 115 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. The Coast Guard was still trying to determine exactly why the charter boat went down in apparently calm seas. The boat's engine room apparently flooded, but the crew did n't notice until the vessel already had begun to sink, said <PERSON> Veronica </PERSON> <PERSON> Cady </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> public affairs office in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> Five helicopters, two airplanes and the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter <PERSON> Iris </PERSON> participated in the search, which began Thursday night when the Cougar, a former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> launch, was reported overdue at <LOCATION> Depoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. The boat, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Depoe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Charter, was hired for a day of tuna fishing. Helicopter crews located the survivors and three of the bodies at about 10:30 a.m. Friday, about three hours after the search had resumed. A fourth body was located nearby a few hours later. The boat was equipped with citizens band and marine radios, but no distress calls had been monitored on any frequencies, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovett </PERSON>. The dead were identified as <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, 40, owner and operator of the boat; <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Depoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, a crewman; <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boxwell </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> Corvallis </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Hallie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wynne </PERSON>, no age available, of <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Li Peng Says Summit Possible, China Seeks Better Ties With Soviets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> said today that a Chinese-Soviet summit can be held if lower-level meetings bring the two sides closer together on issues such as <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. He also denied that the leadership is split over how to proceed with troubled economic reforms and said that reports of major resistance to reform are groundless. The premier, meeting with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> board of directors and executives, said improved relations with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> were in the interests of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and world peace and would not threaten <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s ties with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the West. It was the most favorable Chinese response yet to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s repeated invitations for a summit meeting to end a quarter-century of estrangement between the communist neighbors. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> renewed the invitation in a speech Friday in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> in which he said he was ready to begin summit preparations without delay. The People's Daily and the official English-language <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> reported <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s offer without comment. Although <PERSON> Li </PERSON> noted <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s longstanding `` three obstacles'' to a Chinese-Soviet summit, he seemed to play down the differences while emphasizing that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` would like very much to normalize relations.'' The three obstacles are the Soviet troop presence in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the nine-year occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by Soviet-allied <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, and the heavy Soviet troop presence on its border with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Progress recently has been made in all three areas. <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, speaking through an official interpreter at <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Diaoyutai </LOCATION> state guesthouse, said the most important issue was for <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to pull out of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> has already begun a partial troop withdrawal from the embattled country. Chinese and Soviet negotiations who met last month to discuss <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> were `` relatively close'' on the need for a Vietnamese withdrawal, he said. `` It still takes a series of negotiations between the two sides to bring their views closer together,'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said. `` Once there is further agreement the subject of a summit meeting will be placed on the agenda.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has consistently used the leverage of a potential summit meeting to try to resolve one of its primary security concerns: the fear of an expansionist <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on its southern border. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said Chinese-Soviet relations could not return to the comraderie of the 1950s, when the two nations were close allies and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> sent thousands of technicians to help develop industry in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which was devastated by a civil war. The two countries split bitterly in the early 1960s over strategic and ideological differences. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> also sought to reassure <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the West, with whom <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has developed friendly ties and trade in the past decade, that they have nothing to fear from a Soviet-Chinese rapproachment. `` Improvement of Chinese-Soviet relations will not impair relations between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and it will be in the interests of world peace,'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said.

Reports in the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and Western press have speculated that <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s powers have declined as a result of the 20 percent inflation rate, out-of-control public spending, panic buying and corruption that now plague the economy. In the past month the government has taken several measures to calm consumers and cool off the economy, including pegging bank interest rates to inflation to end runs on banks and pledging there will be no more price hikes this year. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said these decisions were made by top party and government leaders `` under the directorship of General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> and some were proposed by him himself.''

The prosecutor made the claim in the court case of <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> <PERSON> Maina </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimani </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kimani </PERSON> was sentenced Friday to seven years in prison after he pleaded guilty to charges of possessing seditious literature from the clandestine <ORGANIZATION> Kenya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> Revolutionary Movement. It was the first time officials acknowledged the existence of the rebel groups. The <ORGANIZATION> Kenya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> is allegedly led by <PERSON> Koigi </PERSON> <PERSON> wa </PERSON> <PERSON> Wamwere </PERSON>, a former legislator living in exile in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> Revolutionary Movement, is said to be led by <PERSON> Raila </PERSON> <PERSON> Odinga </PERSON>. <PERSON> Odinga </PERSON>, the elder son of former vice president and government critic, <PERSON> Oginga </PERSON> <PERSON> Odinga </PERSON>, was detained Sept. 9 under security laws that allow for detention without trial.

This was in addition to $ 289 <PERSON> Kimani </PERSON> had received by mail, the prosecutor said. <PERSON> Chunga </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kimani </PERSON> escorted three recruits to <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION> on April 29 and they left for <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> May 16. <PERSON> Chunga </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kimani </PERSON> learned <PERSON> Odinga </PERSON> headed the <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> Revolutionary Movement when he delivered a letter from <LOCATION> Wamwere </LOCATION> after a May 27 meeting in <LOCATION> Kampala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kimani </PERSON> then met <PERSON> Odinga </PERSON> June 26 and later provided travel documents for other recruits from the <ORGANIZATION> Kenya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, the prosecutor said.

 A Solidarity leader today said Interior Minister <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> told members of the independent labor movement that he sees a future for the banned group but refused to promise legalization. <PERSON> Wladyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Frasyniuk </PERSON> described the six-hour meeting he attended Friday, and said the opposition side emerged `` with a feeling of victory.'' At the meeting, Solidarity chairman <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and government officials agreed to hold broad-based talks in mid-October to focus on national problems and the future of Solidarity. `` Our positions got closer. I am satisfied,'' a tired-looking <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said after the meeting at a government guest house outside <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> last month persuaded striking workers to end a wave of walkouts after obtaining the government's agreement to hold talks. He had not met with the government for six years. For the first time Friday, other Solidarity members and representatives of the official trade union alliance OPZZ were brought into talks to prepare for October's discussions. According to <PERSON> Frasyniuk </PERSON>, the leader of a Solidarity chapter in the southwestern city of <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION>, Gen. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> told opposition representatives that he sees a place for Solidarity in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s future but could not take a decision now because his hands are tied Alternate Politburo member <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciosek </PERSON> told the meeting there was strong resistance to the idea of legalizating Solidarity among the police and army, who `` fear this symbol,'' according to <PERSON> Frasyniuk </PERSON>. `` They clearly said, ` Give us time,''' <PERSON> Frasyniuk </PERSON> said. There was no immediate government confirmation of <PERSON> Frasyniuk </PERSON>'s account <PERSON> Frasyniuk </PERSON> told reporters that the union decided to continue talks even without a firm commitment because it did not want to be seen as being the first to break off the process of negotiation. After the meeting, participants had `` a feeling of victory,'' he said. `` You could see that the problem of Solidarity was the dominant one, and nobody directly attacked Solidarity.'' The trade union movement, the first ever permitted in the Soviet bloc, was broken up in 1981 under martial law and later banned. The meeting, the second between <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and communist authorities in two days, was called to set terms for a round-table meeting of groups, including Solidarity, that represent various sectors of Polish society. They are to address major Polish problems, including the future of the outlawed Solidarity and of trade union pluralism. `` Some bitter things were traded,'' said mediator <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Stelmachowski </PERSON>. The recent labor unrest posed the most serious threat to Solidarity since it was crushed in 1981. <PERSON> Stelmachowski </PERSON>, a law professor who has been the go-between in arranging the meetings, reported that no decisions were taken `` but there was some progress.'' In the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, meanwhile, the state-run media softened their hard-line support of the Polish government, saying both officials and protesters are to blame for many of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s problems and that the two should compromise. The daily newspapers <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> carried commentaries Friday suggesting that workers were driven to strike by the government's mishandling of sharp price increases in the spring. <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> said trust in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s government has eroded so badly that the leadership may not survive. `` Will the incumbent government stay in power or will it resign? This issue has become a political reality and will be discussed by the Polish parliament,'' wrote <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Runov </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> correspondent for the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> today preached peace and reconciliation in northern <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, where a 13-year civil conflict has forced 1 million to flee and left 6 million at the edge of famine. The Roman Catholic leader traveled from <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION>, the capital, to this <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> port city in the devastated north, where he celebrated Mass before thousands of people, including many refugees. The pope lamented `` the prevailing situation of insecurity due to violence which ... generates violence, anxiety and distress, leaving limited space for freedom.'' <LOCATION> Beira </LOCATION>, which has port and rail facilities that reach into landlocked <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> nations, has been a frequent target of attacks by rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> Mozambique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION>, known by their Portuguese acronyn as <ORGANIZATION> Renamo </ORGANIZATION>. The rebels in a statement today from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> claimed their troops killed 46 soldiers from <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> in the last 30 days, including one near <LOCATION> Vila </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mungari </LOCATION>, southwest of <LOCATION> Beira </LOCATION>. Rebel leader <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhlakama </PERSON> also said he hoped the papal visit would contribute to peace in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. Some Mozambican bishops have been urging President <PERSON> Joaquim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON>'s Marxist government to start talks with the rebels. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> told <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> Friday night that `` the efforts of my brother bishops in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> have always received my backing.'' The Marxist government, however, has refused to negotiate and has criticized the bishops for advocating talk with `` armed bandits.'' `` The weapons we are still obliged to carry are used exclusively to defend our country's freedom and our nation,'' <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> told the pope. The Mozambican army, assisted by Zimbabwean forces, has been able to keep the rail lines running for the past year. <ORGANIZATION> Renamo </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas also have been extremely active in <LOCATION> Nampula </LOCATION> province, where the pope will stop this afternoon for a meeting with local Roman Catholic clergy. The conflict that started in 1975 between the government and the guerrillas has forced about 1 million Mozambicans to flee into neighboring countries and left an estimated 6 million of <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s 14.5 million people in need of food aid, according to relief organizations. The anti-Marxist guerrillas, believed to number between 12,000-22 ,000, are able to roam the countryside almost at will No government acknowledges assisting the rebels, who have caused tremendous economic damage and have been accused of widespread civilian atrocities. <ORGANIZATION> Renamo </ORGANIZATION> denies the charges. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, in a report released in April, estimated the rebels had killed 100,000 civilians in the past two to three years. Earlier this week, <ORGANIZATION> Renamo </ORGANIZATION> announced a unilateral cease-fire during the pope's visit and wished the pontiff a good stay. Nonetheless, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> announced extensive security measures for the pope and the pilgrims traveling to see him. <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> is the final stop on the pope's 10-day tour of southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. He has visited <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> and made a brief, unscheduled stop in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> after his plane was diverted in bad weather. <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, which also has been ravaged by drought in recent years, receives most of its military assistance from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but increasingly has been making overtures to Western nations. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the largest donor of food aid to <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has been providing military training. <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> also has been working to improve relations with neighboring <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which has backed <ORGANIZATION> Renamo </ORGANIZATION> in the past. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> says it stopped supporting the guerrillas under terms of a 1984 mutual non-aggression pact, but <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> has continued to charge <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> with providing assistance.

 Republicans are planning to whittle away at Democratic-proposed increases in the $ 3.35 minimum wage for the first time in eight years through a subminimum `` training'' wage _ but not until next week. With many senators taking Friday off to campaign for re-election in their home states, Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, was unwilling to risk a vote on a Democratic measure aimed at killing his proposal for a 80 percent subminimum wage. Under the <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> proposal, employers could pay the `` training'' wage during the first 90 days a worker is on their payroll. Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., the chief author of the mininum wage bill, was ready to vote Friday on his proposal to double the number of student exemptions that employers can now use to pay part-time workers 15 percent below the wage floor _ or $ 2.85 an hour presently <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> called <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s proposal a `` mock training wage,'' saying it would would not give employers any incentive to `` open the door to those who have nothing, who are undereducated and unskilled.'' He said his subminimum training wage advocated by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, R-Ind., could `` create hundreds of thousands of new jobs. With presidential and congressional elections just eight weeks away, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other Republicans have softened their opposition to any increase, but have not said how large it should be. In June, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> offered before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> a proposed raise to $ 4 an hour over two years but coupled it with a subminimum training wage. The measure was never voted on. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, said Friday that a lower training wage, the administration's euphemism for a subminimum rate that it has advocated since 1981, must accompany any increase for him to support it. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> called the Republican proposals a <ORGANIZATION> Trojan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horse </ORGANIZATION>, saying <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s proposal for a $ 4 minimum wage amounts to a 10 percent cut in buying power after taking inflation into account from when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took office. `` And from that miserly floor, he proposes a further cut for all new hires,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` Can this be what <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> means when he talks about a kinder, gentler <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>?'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s bill would raise the minimum wage 40 cents an hour in each of the next three years _ to $ 3.75 in 1989; $ 4.15 in 1990 and $ 4.55 in 1991 _ directly benefitting about 15 million workers now paid less than $ 4.50 an hour. Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said he hoped to get a vote on <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>'s different subminimum proposals next Tuesday and a vote on final passage by the end of next House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will take up and `` likely pass'' it as soon as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> acts.

<TEXT>
 A state appeals court that upheld the fraud conviction of <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> `` Bill'' <PERSON> Bonnano </PERSON> rejected a claim by the son of reputed Mafia boss <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonnano </PERSON> that he was the victim of discriminatory prosecution. A 3-0 decision of the <ORGANIZATION> 1st </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> on Friday upheld the 1985 conviction and four-year prison sentence of the younger <PERSON> Bonnano </PERSON> for cheating elderly residents out of $ 45,000 in a home improvement scheme. Although another man, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Insana </PERSON>, committed most of the acts in the scheme and was given immunity from prosecution for his testimony, the jury could well have concluded that <PERSON> Bonnano </PERSON> `` was often the motivating force behind <PERSON> Insana </PERSON>'s ` rip-offs,''' said the opinion by Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Newsom </PERSON>. The ruling also said <PERSON> Bonnano </PERSON> had failed to prove that authorities were out to get him because of his `` notorious family background.'' Prosecutors said <PERSON> Bonnano </PERSON> and <PERSON> Insana </PERSON> cooperated in a scheme to cheat customers of <PERSON> Insana </PERSON>'s contracting company. The victims were homeowners, most of them elderly, who bought home improvement contracts. Largely through the testimony of <PERSON> Insana </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bonnano </PERSON> was convicted of eight grand theft charges, involving $ 45,700 taken from four people between October 1977 and January 1978, and of conspiracy to commit grand theft. He was acquitted of 10 other grand theft charges. The appeals judges rejected <PERSON> Bonnano </PERSON>'s argument that the convictions were improperly based on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice, <PERSON> Insana </PERSON>. They also rejected <PERSON> Bonnano </PERSON>'s claim that <PERSON> Insana </PERSON> should have been declared incompetent to testify because he was allegedly an alcoholic.

Before the weekend was over, the 8th annual convention was expected to draw several hundred competitors for a wide range of paramilitary events. Participants spent the earlier part of the week attending shooting matches and learning survival, commando and defensive techniques. Seminars ranged from air operations in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> terrorism and new Soviet weaponry. In addition, some 7,000 visitors were expected to browse through an exhibit hall filled with knives, stun guns, semi-automatic pistols, high-powered sniper rifles and assault weapons. One gray-haired woman, clad in a camouflage hat, slacks and jacket and a T-shirt touting the Survival Store gun shop, huffed her way up a disabled escalator to a convention area where some 200 exhibitors were displaying their weapons. <ORGANIZATION> Intratec </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> featured its new Scorpion, a pistol capable of firing 30 rounds as fast as the finger can squeeze the trigger. `` It's for defense and recreation,'' said company spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>. `` It's great for a family, for recreational shooting. A child can handle it. It's great for plinking tin cans.'' The company also is promoting a weapon less than 5 inches long that fits in the palm of a hand, touting it as `` a very affordable insurance policy.'' Action Arms of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> promoted a range of weapons as `` New Toys for the Big Boys.'' Among the weapons was a 32-round <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> pistol, less than 10 inches long, manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>. At the end of one aisle, a man on a videotape discussed `` the myth of shooting to wound versus shooting to kill,'' saying the latter was the smarter policy. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciammitti </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Guardian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, talked of personal security items such as tear gas, stun guns up to 100,000 volts, a strobe light that temporarily blinds an attacker and a new dry powder that swells an attacker's eyes and throat, making it hard to see and breathe. T-shirt vendors were doing a booming business, with messages such as `` Mercenaries Never Die: They Just Go to Hell to Regroup,'' `` Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap,'' `` Fight Crime _ Shoot Back'' and `` Gun Control is Being Able to Hit Your Target.'' Bumper stickers implored `` <PERSON> Boycott </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>'' and `` Pardon Ollie _ Indict <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' Throughout the exhibit hall and registration areas were giant bottles for donations to various causes, including the Omega First Amendment Legal Fund, to be used to fight a $ 9.4 million judgment levied against Soldier of Fortune magazine in a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> case. The lawsuit claimed that <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> hired a hit man through the magazine's personal services classified ads, and the hit man killed <PERSON> Black </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> of <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, on Feb. 21, 1985. The magazine was found negligent for publishing the ad. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, editor and publisher of the <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, Colo.-based magazine, said in a statement to conventioneers that it would be impossible for a publication to track down and verify each advertiser's `` hidden agenda.'' Black is on <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> death row for paying <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> $ 10,000 to kill Mrs. <PERSON> Black </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> is serving three life terms for the Black slaying and two other killings in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>.

 Radical students demonstrating against the Olympic Games and the government have seen their support dwindle to a handful of diehards, and most Koreans have rejected their violent extremism. The radical movement has lost ground as hope grows in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> that political reforms will end the nation's long tradition of authoritarian rule and produce an enduring democratic system. Many Koreans, including a growing number of students, say violent anti-government protests are no longer necessary. People are increasingly critical of the radicals. `` Students know the people are against these demonstrations,'' a student leader said. Demonstrations against the Olympics, which began Saturday, have been small by Korean standards with the turnout dropping each day. Protests have been confined to campuses away from the Olympic venues and many have been peaceful. The government helped to defuse the protests by ordering riot police to avoid clashes if possible and not to use tear gas during the Olympics. Radicals marching out of colleges for violent protests several times found no police waiting to confront them and ended up dispersing in confusion. But violence has not disappeared completely. Protesting radicals hurled firebombs at runners escorting the Olympic torch to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> last week but failed to stop it. On Saturday, riot police beat radical students who staged an anti-Olympic protest in the heart of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. About 20 protesters were arrested. Student leaders say the Olympics should have been shared with communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to help reunite the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. They claimed the Games were being used to keep the two Koreas divided. `` We must oppose single-host Olympics which prolong dictatorship and perpetuate nation division,'' said a student leader, who like other radicals spoke on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> boycotted the Olympics after its demand to co-host the Games was rejected. The peninsula was divided in 1945. The radicals hoped to use the Games to continue anti-government protests by claiming they were being used to cement authoritarian rule. Radicals say President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s government is a front for military rule and insist there have been no political reforms. `` The Olympics are being used to cement the fascist regime,'' one student leader told a recent demonstration. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, a former general who took office in February, introduced broad reforms and most forms of political activity are now legal after years of repression. Even the main opposition parties agree that <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> is making an effort to build democracy. The changing political climate began to erode support for the radical movement this year. Once the spearhead for political change in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, the movement began losing many students because they no longer saw the need for violent protests. The departure of moderate students enabled leftist hardliners to take control of the student groups. The hardliners have attempted to compensate for their smaller numbers with more violent tactics. But the call for anti-Olympic protests has attracted little support. Top opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> said even the radical leaders realize that the great majority of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> want the Games to be a success. Koreans see the Olympics as a way to put the country in the front rank of nations. `` The students know they will not be supported by our people,'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said in an interview. Onlookers have jeered protesting radicals at several demonstrations, criticizing them for ruining <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s image at a time when world attention was focused on the country. `` Go home. You are shaming our nation,'' screamed an angry old man at protesters at one demonstration. While the radicals have lost support, political observers say they can not be ignored because of their willingness to use violence. A change in the political situation or loss of confidence in the government could revive the radicals' support, they add. Radicals form less than 10 percent of about 1 million college students. Other students may like some of the radicals' ideas, but reject their violent tactics. The radicals come from all social and economic backgrounds. Children of senior officials and military officers join children of workers and poor farmers in campus groups, united by a common idealism and anger over years of oppressive rule. The radicals say they are fighting for creation of an idealistic `` society of the masses'' with students, workers and peasants uniting to end oppression, poverty and exploitation. But the radicals often are vague about their goals. `` We feel in our hearts that something must be done now. People just talk and the government uses that to continue its rule. We must act to force change,'' said one leader.

 Riot police Saturday dispersed and beat radical students who staged an anti-Olympic protest in the heart of the capital on the opening day of the Olympics. About 20 protesters were arrested. Students later held a rally at <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the north of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and burned an effigy painted with an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag in the shape of a nuclear bomb. `` Oppose dictator's Olympics,'' students chanted at both protests. About 200 students shouting anti-Olympic slogans tried to march through <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s main shopping district towards Myongdong Cathedral to protest the opening of the Games. The brief protest was held about 10 miles from the Olympic venues. Scores of riot police charged the march after it had gone about 150 yards. Police roughly dispersed the protesters. Riot police punched and kicked protesters and arrested about 20 who were forced into a bus and taken away. Others protesters fled as police chased them. It was the first protest staged in the city center in several weeks. Protesters did not attempt to fight police. Nearly 10,000 Olympic athletes from 160 countries opened the biggest athletic show on earth Saturday under a massive security blanket and the jealous glare of communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. A colorful, 3 -LCB- - hour spectacle, mixing ancient Korean rituals with space-age technology, kicked off 16 days of athletic competition at the Summer Games The Games will produce the first all-out East-West gold rush since the 1976 Games in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. Later Saturday, about 300 students staged an anti-American protest at <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. They denounced the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governments and demanded the Olympics be shared with communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. `` Yankee go home,'' students shouted as they shot their fists into the air. About 400 riot police kept watch outside the school, but did not intervene and students dispersed without a confrontation. Radical students have staged many protests against the Olympics and the government of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo. The radicals are demanding the Olympics be shared with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to help unify the two Koreas which were divided at the end of World War II in 1945 and which fought the 1950-1953 Korean War <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> boycotted the Olympics after its demand to co-host the Games was turned down by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The radicals contend the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> helps to enforce the partition of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. Radicals demand the expulsion of the 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based in the nation under a mutual defense treaty.

<HEAD>Alarm That Official Secrecy Becoming Censorship Under Thatcher</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Subscribers to Index on Censorship got a surprise this month. Instead of the usual reports of suppression of free speech by dictatorships, the entire issue of the small but respected journal was devoted to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. It reflected growing alarm among editors, broadcasters and civil libertarians that Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government is adding censorship to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s already extensive official secrecy. From repeated attempts to suppress news about <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> to a worldwide government campaign to ban the publication of an intelligence veteran's memoirs, the list of recent controversies over media freedom has grown dramatically. `` If freedom is diminished in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, where historically it has deep roots, it is potentially diminished everywhere,'' wrote <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, an assistant editor of the Independent newspaper. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> edited the special issue of the Index of Censorship, a monthly journal on freedom of speech and censorship. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> insists she is trying to bolster national security, deny terrorists a platform and restore discipline to a leaky civil service. But during her nine-year tenure, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has gained a reputation as the most secretive of the Western democracies. `` Secrecy from the top of our society to the bottom is preventing newspapers from telling the public what is really happening,'' the Guild of British Newspaper Editors charged in a recent report, `` Officially Secret.'' The problem was underscored when Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> ignored calls to explain a mysterious incident in which a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> diplomat was expelled last week after firing a gun on a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> street. Those who felt the public was entitled to know why lives were put in danger received a stock response: The government never `` makes statements on matters relating to national security.'' The March shooting of three <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> members on a bombing mission in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> also stirred the secrecy debate. When two British television companies turned up witness' accounts suggesting soldiers deliberately shot to death the three men instead of trying to arrest them, the government pressured the networks to suppress the films, arguing they would prejudice the inquest The networks refused and the films were screened on schedule. Other incidents have raised concern over official secrecy: _ A police raid on <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> studios to seize tapes of a documentary about a secret spy satellite _ A legal bid this year to stop <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> radio broadcasting from interviews with current and former members of the intelligence services _ The confiscation of unscreened TV film of street violence in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>; a court order delaying screening of a film about an IRA-related trial _ The banning of a <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> film about an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> sympathizer that provoked a one-day protest strike at the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> Overshadowing all for sheer cost and persistence is the <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> administration's worldwide two-year court battle to suppress `` Spycatcher,'' the memoirs of retired intelligence operative <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> says she is defending a principle _ the life-long oath of secrecy taken by secret agents. She has lost her battle in foreign courts, but in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> it drags on. The Guardian and Observer newspapers are still fighting in court to publish extracts of `` Spycatcher.'' In Bath, southern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, bookseller <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON> this month received a summons for contempt of court for selling copies of `` Spycatcher'' that had been imported from <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON> works alone and said he could be bankrupted by legal costs, but added in a telephone interview: `` I sell books, it's my living and I do n't see why I should be deprived of that right because of some overweening authority.'' Since coming to office in 1979, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government has used the all-embracing 1911 Official Secrets Act in at least 24 prosecutions, compared with 34 the previous 68 years. The act makes it an offense for a civil servant to disclose any information, however trivial, without authorization. The government has unveiled a proposed reform confining the act mainly to defense, intelligence and foreign relations matters, saying this would dispel any notion it was being used to protect the government from embarrassment. But the proposals reinforce the lifetime gag on intelligence officers and shield the intelligence services from any parliamentary scrutiny. Some newspapers have responded by printing sensitive stories under headlines pointing out that under the new law, such stories will be unpublishable. Novelist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mortimer </PERSON> wrote in Index of Censorship: `` In healthier days most newspapers ... attacked the government of the day, whichever government it might be. Now, however, too many journalists censor themselves.'' <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Frankel </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION>, which is pressing for a U.S.-style law, said, `` Press freedom is deteriorating ... And it's notable how relatively little opposition there's been from the press itself.'' <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Dworkin </PERSON>, professor of jurisprudence at <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, concluded in Index on Censorship: `` Censorship is no longer an isolated exception. ... The sad truth is that the very concept of liberty is being challenged and corroded by the <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> government.''

 Attending a school where the ratio of women to men is 63-to-1 may seem like heaven to some young men, but for the first seven full-time male students admitted to <ORGANIZATION> Centenary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in 78 years, it can be a little strange. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, a 21-year-old junior from <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Olive </LOCATION>, acknowledged that he was `` a little uncomfortable with all girls in class'' but said he was able to adjust by the time he attended his second class after school opened Sept. 7. <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, a psychology and elementary education major, recalls how a female student saw him standing outside a classroom and mistook him for the professor. `` Most of the girls are friendly. It seems like they know me more than I know them,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>, 21, a freshman business major. <PERSON> West </PERSON> said his decision to attend the school was supported by all his friends _ except his girlfriend, who is a sophomore. `` She's not too happy about my going here,'' <PERSON> West </PERSON> said. West does n't expect to be distracted by his female counterparts, or at least `` not so much on my part but on the girls' part because I'm the new element.'' Centenary College was founded in this northwestern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> town as a coeducational preparatory school in 1867. Admission was limited to girls in 1910 and Centenary became a women's junior college in 1940. The four-year college was formed in 1976, and men were allowed to enroll only in the Continuing Education Division, consisting mainly of night classes. In April, the trustees decided to admit male students full time. <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Prisco </PERSON>, vice president for academic affairs and dean of the college, said the board decided it was `` the right time and the right circumstances'' to admit men full time. She said the school responded to the success of the continuing education division and the fact that male students were requesting admission to full-time programs. `` We felt very strongly that we were operating from a foundation of constraints and that it was the time to go coeducational,'' she said. `` It certainly broadens the perspective of the classes,'' Ms. <PERSON> Prisco </PERSON> said. `` The teaching challenge, I think, becomes greater ... the richness of discussion in class becomes greater ... it brings a whole new perspective. `` However, it does n't mean that we are going to forsake our mission of providing a strong education for women. I do n't think we have to give up one for the other.'' Total enrollment is about 450 students. There were 192 incoming students in 1987, down from 235 in 1986 and 261 in 1985, according to admissions department statistics. Adding male minds to the campus will not precipitate changes in the curriculum, Ms. <PERSON> Prisco </PERSON> said. `` I think we have strong academic programs and I think that's why we have the seven male students ... because they've realized our programs are strong,'' she said All seven are commuters, but dormitory space for men will be available in 1989, Ms. <PERSON> Prisco </PERSON> said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stowe </PERSON>, 23, a transfer student who lives within walking distance, said he decided to attend Centenary because it is a small, private school. `` I enjoy the campus and it's terribly convenient for me,'' he said. `` It's been a really neat experience for me ... but it is a little strange walking into a room full of girls and not seeing another guy there.'' <PERSON> Stowe </PERSON>'s girlfriend also is not too happy with his choice of academic institutions. `` She's not pleased a bit but she's getting over that,'' he said.

<HEAD>Aquino Says U.S. Must Respond To Soviet Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said Saturday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must decide whether to accept a Soviet offer and close its bases here in return for a Soviet pullout from a strategic garrison in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. On Friday, Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> offered to abandon its naval facilities in <LOCATION> Cam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> removed its six military installations from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. `` That is for the two superpowers to discuss and to talk about,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> told reporters. She gave no indication whether her government will make any recommendation to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> over the Soviet offer. Other Filipino officials also reacted cautiously to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s offer, which was part of a seven-point plan for reducing tensions in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proposal came during growing opposition to the bases here and against the backdrop of deadlocked U.S.-Philippine talks over the future of the installations, which include <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, Subic Bay Naval Base and four smaller installations. Talks between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> over the final two years of the 1947 Military Bases Agreement have stalled over compensation and other issues. On Thursday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wanted to keep <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, <PERSON> Subic </PERSON> and four other installations in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> but that <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s demands for more money were too high <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> met this week in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with Filipino Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> to discuss the impasse but neither side announced any progress. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pays about $ 180 million a year for use of the six bases. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> has said the Americans have offered about $ 502 million in compensation, but he said the Philippine demand for $ 1.2 billion a year would be a `` reasonable'' figure. The agreement expires in 1991, and Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has refused to say whether she will allow the bases to remain after that. In a statement to reporters, Sen. <PERSON> Leticia </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahani </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military facilities were not comparable and that the <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and <PERSON> Subic </PERSON> bases were `` far bigger complexes'' than <PERSON> Cam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranh </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON>. Two other senators, <PERSON> Heherson </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Saguisag </PERSON>, welcomed the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> proposal but warned that the issue would require careful study. In other developments, the government announced Saturday that Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> ordered the cancellation of the passport of the founder of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION> after the military claimed he had resumed leadership of the rebel movement. The statement released by the presidential palace said Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> issued the order Friday against <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Sison </PERSON>, whom she freed from prison in 1986. <PERSON> Sison </PERSON> left the country six months later and is believed to be in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The military said <PERSON> Sison </PERSON> has been soliciting funds for the rebels abroad. <PERSON> Sison </PERSON> founded the Maoist party in 1968 and was arrested in 1977. He was among about 500 political prisoners released by Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> in March 1986, one month after a civilian-military uprising toppled <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and propelled her to power. The party and its armed wing, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, have been waging a 19-year insurgency to establish a Marxist state in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Elsewhere, the military said suspected rebels led by a fugitive <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest ambushed a government jeep in the southern <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, killing five people. Col. <PERSON> Rogelio </PERSON> <PERSON> Villanueva </PERSON>, regional army commander, said the attack occurred Friday in the coastal town of <LOCATION> Cortes </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Surigao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sur </LOCATION> province about 510 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Villanueva </PERSON> said about 30 guerrillas opened fire on the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irrigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> jeep as it passed by on an isolated strip of the national highway. <PERSON> Villanueva </PERSON> quoted the survivors as saying the rebel band was led by renegade priest <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON>, one of the best known clerics who have joined the rebellion.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has dropped a line from his stock campaign speech: the one about being the underdog and liking it. Little more than a month ago, the vice president was trailing Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in national public opinion polls by double digits. Now, most polls show <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has seized the agenda and is either leading <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> or is even with him. Political professionals offer differing explanations for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s rapid rise But most suggest a combination of factors: his well-received convention address, a series of speeches that put <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on the defensive, and the failure of questions over running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s military record to stick as a major liability. Some analysts also cite quick damage control on the part of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign team, led by campaign chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, in minimizing possible embarrassments _ such as the quick resignations last week of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> operative <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> and six members of an ethnic coalition after allegations of anti-Semitic activities surfaced. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself says he's doing a better job now in `` getting through to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' both in terms of personality and message and that `` there's a good sense the campaign is on the move.'' The speed of the vice president's rally was welcomed by campaign officials. `` All of us had a lot of confidence in him and a lot of confidence the campaign would start moving in the right direction. But all of us were surprised how fast it did,'' campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said. Atwater credits <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s convention acceptance speech _ in which he appealed for a `` kinder, gentler nation'' and moved out from the shadow of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ as decisive in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s surge. Private analysts agree the speech was important but suggest other factors for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s rise, including a major miscalculation on the part of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> strategists on the impact of the Quayle controversy. `` There is an old political axiom: never murder anyone when they're committing suicide,'' said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON>, a political analyst with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` There was a tactical judgment in the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign to lay low for a few weeks or play presidential.'' `` But that did n't work very well,'' since the <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> episode `` has n't done the damage to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that one might have imagined,'' <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON> said. `` Then, they -LRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign -RRB- were flat-footed when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went aggressively on attack.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> aside, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> roared out of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> with a series of speeches that depicted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a liberal who is soft on crime and quick to raise taxes. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign did little to respond. Some Republicans said the furor over reports that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> used family influence to join the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> during the Vietnam War era may have actually worked to the ticket's advantage. Republican consultant <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> said, `` People were very sympathetic to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and did n't understand what all the fuss was. They were getting no news about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and there was a lot of sympathy for this guy.'' Democratic consultant <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Garth </PERSON> disagreed and said the selection of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> `` was without doubt the dumbest move the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign has made. It was dumb to pick him and dumb to stick with him.'' `` My feeling is that, had <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> picked anybody else but <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the election would be over today'' _ with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> the loser, <PERSON> Garth </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s rise in the polls reflected `` a very good speech at the convention'' and what he contended were misleading polls that showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ahead of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> earlier in the summer. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appeared to be ahead only because of `` a false bump'' he got from public attention to his lengthy primary battle against <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` Then the only question left was whether <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would cause trouble at the Democratic convention. And when he did n't, it gave another spurt to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Garth </PERSON> said. Other analysts suggested that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' lack of movement in the polls reflects a common political phenomenon, a problem that in fact affected <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in his 1980 presidential bid: A relatively unknown candidate gets a big surge in the polls from winning primaries, then sees it evaporate as voters get to know more about the candidate and lose their initial curiosity.

<HEAD>McFarlane Says Administration Exaggerated Potential Of Defenses</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> `` Bud'' <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, who was White House national security adviser in 1983 when President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> launched the Star Wars initiative, says the administration engaged in `` romantic and hyperbolic hyperbole'' to exaggerate the potential of space-based defenses. `` Truly impressive gains have been made in the technologies associated with ballistic missile defense since the late 1960s,'' <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> wrote in the fall issue of Foreign Affairs magazine. `` Yet there is no basis for saying that any of these systems will be adaptable as effective weapons systems before the turn of the century, except for two traditional ground-based interceptors, `` said <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s national security adviser 1983-85. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> said that he was among the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> advisers who urged <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to outline the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> plan, formally known as the Strategic Defense Initiative, during a March 1983 speech on defense issues. `` The president's speech provoked a firestorm of debate, and in the five years since then have been marked by bitter, passionate advocacy and criticism,'' he said. Initially, <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> said, the debate was `` polarized by, on the one hand, the romantic and manipulative hyperbole of the administration and, on the other, by the flatly dismissive rhetoric of scientists who should have known better.'' In answer to the question, `` can defensive technologies provide the means to defend us against ballistic missile attack?'' said <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, `` we do not know and can not know for the next 10 to 15 years.'' Despite the sometimes misguided political debate that followed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Star Wars speech in 1983, said <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, the initiative helped force the Soviets back to the negotiating table, nudged them toward 50 percent cuts in strategic arms and may have prompted them to into economic reforms. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> wrote that `` those of us in the White House who proposed the Strategic Defense Initiative believe that a reorientation of our investment strategy to emphasize an area of our comparative advantage _ excellence in high technology _ could persuade the Soviets that we could outstrip an entire generation of Soviet military investment.'' `` If we could do so, we could remove their only claim to superpower status and perhaps lead them to deal more constructively with our concerns about their -LRB- strategic rocket -RRB- forces,'' he said. `` The Soviets' commitment to a 50-percent reduction in their heavy missile launchers and warheads _ a possibility they would not discuss seriously until after SDI was proposed _ represents a vindication of that strategy,'' wrote <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> officer, resigned from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff in December 1985 and is now a counselor at the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He pleaded guilty in March to four counts of misleading <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about the Iran-Contra affair, in which the administration sent arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in hopes of winning freedom for American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

 Troops opened fire on anti-government protesters who surrounded the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> today but later surrendered to the students and <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks who occupied the downtown building, witnesses said. After the soldiers surrendered, they were disguised as protesters so they could escape, witnesses said. Elsewhere, three people accused of offering poisoned water to demonstrators two weeks ago were beaten to death by a mob and beheaded after the monks released them from their custody, witnesses said. Three people were slightly wounded in the shooting at the ministry, the witnesses said, the first known by troops in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> against anti-government protestors since a bloody but ineffective military crackdown last month. The incident at the ministry occurred while as many as half a million students, striking government employees, monks and policemen took to the streets to demand the end to 26 years of authoritarian rule. Two other government buildings nearby, <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, were ringed by demonstrators but there was apparently no bloodshed although some reported hearing shots fired. About 100 soldiers stood guard at each building. A small number of soldiers guarding the <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> opened fire on a surging crowd which surrounded the building and threatened to set it afire. Clambering over adjacent rooftops, students entered the top floor of the four-story structure. According to eyewitness accounts, 24 soldiers inside the building surrendered to monks and were disguised as students wearing red headbands to get them past the mob outside. The soldiers were driven away, possibly to a nearby monastery, and the monks seized one machine gun and several semi-automatic weapons. Today was not the first time soldiers sided with the demonstrators. On Sept. 9, 500 servicemen marched with protesters in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> in the first major military defection. Smaller defections also occurred in the provinces. Three people alleged to have offered poisoned water to demonstrators two weeks ago were beaten to death by a mob and beheaded after being released from the custody of monks, witnesses said. Some opposition leaders, who are believed to be negotiating with President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s government, were attempting to stop mob violence from escalating. On Friday, one key opposition figure, <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, defused a potentially bloody confrontation between soldiers and demonstrators moving on the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> armed with spears, swords and knives. `` They do n't seem to be afraid of the guns. They are angry and frustrated,'' said one Burmese intellectual watching the demonstrators facing off against rifle-armed troops Friday. The renewed protests indicated the general <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> population was unsatisfied with the reforms offered by the government. The state-owned Radio <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> announced Friday that all military personnel and civil servants had to resign from the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and refrain from membership in all future political parties. The decision, the radio said, was made at the recommendation of a recently formed election commission which is to suprevise multiparty elections in about three months. The opposition has rejected this move, saying an interim government must be formed before elections can take place. About two-thirds of the 2.5 million members of the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> come from military and civil service ranks. Several Burmese government employees said today they would defy a government order that they return to work by Sept. 26 or face dismissal. Virtually all government employees, including some police and military personnel, have been on strike since Aug. 8. Earlier today, the demonstrators marched in well-disciplined, peaceful lines and carried placards with anti-government slogans such as, `` If we do n't get it -LRB- democracy -RRB-, we will hit out.'' When smaller numbers of protesters confronted troops at the three government buildings, messages were quickly sent out and shortly the demonstrators were reinforced by others from nearby areas. Massive protests began after authoritarian leader <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON>, who seized power in 1962, resigned in July. His replacement, hardliner <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, attempted to restore calm by ordering the military to fire on protesters, but he resigned 17 days later. On Aug. 19, the relatively moderate <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> became <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s first civilian leader in a quarter-century.

 Israeli troops killed one Palestinian and wounded 24 in the occupied lands today, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> sources said, as residents observed a general strike to mark a massacre of Palestinians in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> six years ago. Today also was the 10th anniversary of the signing of the Camp David accords which called for Palestinian self-rule in the occupied lands and paved the way for the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty of March 1979. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> issued a statement on the accords saying: `` These agreements created a turning point in the history of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. They proved that it's possible to achieve peace between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its neighbors, that the hatred which prevailed is not eternal.'' <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> marked the anniversary by once again blaming `` Israeli intransigence'' for the accords' failure to give the Palestinians in the occupied lands a voice in ruling themselves. But except for the bitterly worded statement by <PERSON> Butros </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghali </PERSON>, minister of state for foreign affairs, the anniversary passed largely unnoticed in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. Underground leaders of the Palestinian uprising called for the general strike to mark the massacre of hundreds of Palestinians in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Sabra </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Chatilla </LOCATION> refugee camps by Israeli-backed Christian militiamen in September 1982. The strike turned violent in several towns and villages. In <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION>, dozens of <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> blocked the road with stones and burning tires and threw rocks at passing military vehicles, an Arab reporter said. Troops opened fire with rubber bullets and tear gas. When the rioters failed to disperse, the soldiers opened fire with real bullets, killing 18-year-old <PERSON> Emad </PERSON> <PERSON> Arkawi </PERSON>. A military spokesman confirmed a dead Palestinian was brought to the hospital but said the army was investigating the circumstances. <PERSON> Arkawi </PERSON> was the 267th Palestinian to die since the intefadeh, Arabic for uprising, began nine months ago. Six Israelis have also been killed. Arab reporters said three Palestinians between the ages of 17 and 20, including one woman, were wounded in the incident. Another 21 Palestinians were wounded, at least one critically, in clashes with troops in other parts of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The army said it was investigating the reports. The general strike was fully observed throughout the occupied territories. In <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION>, Palestinians painted graffiti in Arabic and <LOCATION> Hebrew </LOCATION> saying: `` Death to the Jews,'' and `` The End Is Near.'' It was the first time Arab insurgents have painted graffiti in Hebrew. <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags, outlawed by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, flew from the homes of many <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION> residents. In all the cities of the occupied territories, workers stayed away from their jobs, transportation ground to a halt and the streets were deserted. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags were hoisted on electricity wires and protesters burned tires. Protesters littered the highway linking <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> with nails to prevent cars from traveling.

<TEXT>
 The Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, facing the worst financial crisis of its history, may be forced to lay off as many as 300 of its 1,000 employees over the next few months, according to <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> sources. The crisis is based largely on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's decision to reduce its 1988 contribution to the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> by $ 10 million and by the same amount next year Compounding the problem is the failure of several other major contributors, including <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, to keep their payments current, the sources said. The impending layoffs have generated gloom and uncertainty among <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> employees, most of whom are Latin Americans who are faced with the prospect of the immediate loss of their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visas if their jobs are eliminated. `` The staff is terribly worried,'' said <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Garzon </PERSON>, a Mexican who is president of the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> staff association. He noted that many of the employees are longtime residents of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> area and would have to start from scratch if forced to return with their families to their native lands. `` They are facing a terrible family situation,'' <PERSON> Garzon </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION>, whose origins date back 99 years, is designed to enhance cooperation among the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and more than 30 other countries in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. In its heyday, the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> was seen by successive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administrations as a vital tool for combatting communism in the hemisphere but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has largely ignored the organization in recent years. This is partly because the anti-communist consensus among member states has eroded over the years. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> bypassed the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> in October 1983 when he decided to join forces with several other <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> countries in toppling the leftist government of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>. Neither the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> nor <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has looked to the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> as an appropriate forum for achieving a settlement to their long-running dispute. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with 85 per cent of the combined gross national product of <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> member states, has a quota of about $ 40 million, or 66 per cent of the organization's annual budget of about $ 65 million. The money is used to pay for programs in such fields as human rights, education and drug abuse, among others. But the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, faced with its own budgetary woes, informed the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> last May that it was reneging on $ 10 million of its 1988 quota. The money was reallocated to cover a foreign exchange shortfall that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic missions in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> had experienced as a result of the declining value of the dollar. The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> sources said the second blow came more recently when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> decided to cut $ 10 million from its 1989 quota. `` We have to decide every month which bills we'll pay,'' said one <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> official, insisting on anonymity. He predicted the layoffs would be announced around January 1 after decisions are made on which programs should receive priority. <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>, a Brazilian who has served as <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> secretary general since 1984, was unavailable for comment on the crisis. But he told one interviewer recently that the situation `` is so serious the essence of the organization is in danger.'' <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Garzon </PERSON>, `` We have dedicated our lives to the benefit of the hemisphere. But we are disposable.''

<DATELINE>KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Tourists are flying out and medicine, plastic tents and food are pouring in at <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'s two international airports as this island nation struggles to recover from the fury of Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>. Little by little, <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, home to 2.3 million people, is struggling back from the worst disaster in its history. But it's going to be a slow and painful process The confirmed death toll of 26 was low in comparison with Hurricane Charlie, which hit <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> in 1951 and killed more than 150 people. But <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> caused less physical damage. Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> has estimated losses at $ 8 billion and called <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> the worst disaster in the nation's history. The government say 500,000 people, or two-fifths of the population, have been left homeless after the hurricane roared down the spine of the 144-mile-long island on Monday. Four out of every five houses were either damaged or destroyed as <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s 145 mph winds tore away zinc roofs as if they were plastic sheets. Ninety-three percent of the island still had no electricity Saturday, although power was restored in the northern coast city of <LOCATION> Montego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, the main tourist area. The power failure cut off fresh water supplies to most of the island, including <ORGANIZATION> Kingston </ORGANIZATION>, a city of 750,000 people, because the pumping and filtration plants run on electricity. Power was not expected to be fully restored to the capital for at least two weeks. Crowds gathered around water hydrants and burst mains in 90-degree heat, filling plastic buckets and old milk containers. Reports from the countryside said people were taking water from muddy streams, despite the hazard of contamination. Radio stations carried a taped message every half hour from the health minister, Dr. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Baugh </PERSON>, warning people to boil drinking water, and millions of water purification tablets were being airlifted in from around the world. Looting of stores, warehouses and supermarkets in the first days after the hurricane forced the government to impose a night curfew, which was still in effect at the end of the week. People who failed to stock up before the storm rushed supermarkets and gasoline stations, forming long lines outside both. Armed soldiers were seen regulating the flow of shoppers in and out of a supermarket outside <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION>. On Thursday, <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> declared a 30-day state of public emergency, ordering stores and gasoline stations to reopen and giving security forces `` full'' but unspecified power to ensure that they did. The emergency order also gave the government the right to seize transportation and heavy equipment to distribute supplies arriving from around the world. The loss to agriculture is severe. Government officials said the poultry industry and this years's crop of bananas and coffee were wiped out. <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> told reporters Friday that he would discuss the disaster with world bank officials next week, but had no plan to ask for a rescheduling of <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'s $ 4 billion foreign debt. The disaster hit just as <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> was showing signs of recovery from economic distress brought on by a worldwide slump in the value of bauxite, sugar and other commodities. In addition, tourism _ now the nation's biggest foreign exchange earner at $ 550 million a year _ had staged a remarkable recovery as a result of an intense campaign to rid the island of its reputation for political violence. Although four major hotels in <LOCATION> Montego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> were heavily damaged, <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> said the area was making a quick recovery and the tourist industry was generally in good shape. Elections are due in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> by next March, and <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON>, who is seeking a second consecutive term, has consistently trailed former Prime Minister <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> in opinion polls. There was speculation that his handling of the hurricane disaster could tip the balance.

<TEXT>
 A $ 100,000 reward is on the table and nearly $ 1 million has been paid in ransom, but authorities say they still have n't gotten a break in the kidnapping of the ailing wife of a Jackson multimillionaire. Earlier this month, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials released a statement by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> offering the reward and asking for the safe return of his wife, 72-year-old <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON>, who was abducted from their home July 26. Mrs. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> suffers from intestinal ileitis, a disease that can result in life-threatening complications without medication. `` Nothing is new,'' said Police Department spokesman Sgt. <PERSON> Chip </PERSON> <PERSON> Pippen </PERSON>. `` To my knowledge, at least in the police department, we've had no response to the reward. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said federal authorities had nothing new to report. `` The investigation is ongoing at this time,'' he said. `` The community is concerned, but we just have nothing to report.'' Since Mrs. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON>'s disappearance, the only word from her has been a letter, which the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said was in her handwriting, with an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> postmark. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> could not be reached for comment; calls to his home were not answered. A typed ransom note was left at the house when Mrs. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> was abducted. Small spots of blood were found inside and outside the front door of the two-story house. The crudely phrased note, the only direct word from the kidnappers, instructed <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> to pay an unspecified amount of money to 12 people he had allegedly wronged. The people named in the letter are current or former franchisers with <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which handles portraits of school children, of which <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> was once the largest stockholder. The company filed suit against the 12 in the early 1980s, claiming they owed money from operating loans, materials and film processing fees. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> researched the monetary amounts involved in the lawsuits to decide how much to pay each of the 12. Although neither the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> nor <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> has said exactly how much was paid, the payments `` totaled nearly one million dollars,'' according to <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON>'s Aug. 23 statement. The story of the kidnapping was voluntarily embargoed by the news media for about 30 hours because officials believed publicity might endanger the victim. The kidnapping was disclosed at a news conference July 28 after family members decided to go public because of the vagueness of the demands in the ransom note. On Aug. 23, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials announced that <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> had followed the instructions and that payment had been mailed to the 12 named in the letter, or their survivors, on Aug. 16, the day after <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> received the letter from his wife. The letter promised that Mrs. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> would be returned if the payments were made. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said he could not comment on whether any of the 12 people had returned the money. At least one _ lawyer <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Winn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> _ reportedly did send back a check he received from <LOCATION> Hearin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON>'s worth reportedly exceeds $ 100 million. In addition to being co-owner of <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, he and his partner, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> oil man <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, own controlling interest in <ORGANIZATION> Lamar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a life insurance company which is the largest stockholder in <ORGANIZATION> Trustmark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s second-largest financial institution <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON>, lead researcher for `` Unsolved Mysteries,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s series on unsolved crimes, said producers plan to broadcast a segment about the kidnapping this fall if Mrs. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> is not found Last year, the segments produced tips that led to the capture of nine fugitives and solving of eight cases.

<TEXT>
 Rep. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> says that in his southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> district, support for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> is almost as strong as for the Pledge of Allegiance. So when the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> told <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s constituents to make sure he voted against a waiting period for handgun purchases, they responded. A week ago, they surrounded his car in the district and virtually kept him prisoner inside until he promised to help strip the waiting period from an anti-drug bill. They repeated verbatim all the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> arguments _ especially the fear that this was the beginning of the end of gun ownership. Last Thursday, the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Democrat was part of the 228-182 majority that voted to eliminate from an anti-drug bill a seven-day waiting period for handgun purchases and an optional background check of the buyer. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> substituted a requirement that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> develop a system for gun dealers to check whether buyers are convicted felons. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s case, more than almost any other, shows just how powerful the tug of the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> can be. He has no fear of defeat, because he's not running for re-election due to health reasons. He said he personally supports a waiting period and believes his constituents were `` brainwashed by the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>.'' And he had an emotional reason to support the waiting period, since two of his longtime friends and former constituents are <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. The waiting period is symbolically named after <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, the presidential press secretary who was shot along with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in the March 30, 1981, attempt on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s life. <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> is the vice chair of <ORGANIZATION> Handgun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which joined the nation's major law enforcement organizations to lobby hard for the waiting period. So why did <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> vote with the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>? In his district, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said, `` after the Pledge of Allegiance, the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> comes next. If I'm their spokesman, I'm not going to pull a holier than thou routine. I'm sitting here as a hired hand.'' The tug of the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> was n't as direct on all House members, but it was there nonetheless. Rep. <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Delich </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON>, R-Md., is a strong-willed lawmaker who would never be called a wimp by her colleagues A co-sponsor of the drug bill that contained the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> language, she said she told <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> backers `` I supported <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and leave me alone.'' Ms. <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON> said in an interview she was not pressured by the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>. But when the voting began, she watched the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> supporters pile up an increasing margin for their substitute language. When the pro-NRA count reached a majority, she decided she could n't be of help to the waiting-period forces. Bowing to the inevitable, she inserted her electronic card into a slot that cast her vote for the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>'s position. `` I wanted to see what would happen,'' she said. `` I told <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> a long time ago I would support her amendment. But I made a decision to vote depending on what was on the table. When I voted, the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> amendment was gone.'' It was not the first time the 3-million-member <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> won a gun control fight, though the opposition this time was more formidable. The opponents matched the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>'s zeal, but the gun control forces could not match the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>'s financial resources, said <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, the president of the Fraternal Order of Police. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Conover </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> lobbyist, attributed his group's victory to hard work, good strategy and some last-minute luck. The gun group, as it has many times before, mobilized its 21 field representatives across the country and thousands of activist volunteers. When the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> language appeared ready for a vote two weeks ago, the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> count estimated only a narrow 10-vote victory. Then, the vote was postponed for a week. `` We got lucky,'' <PERSON> Conover </PERSON> said, because the postponement allowed thousands of <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> members to receive their latest issue of either American <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> or American Rifleman _ the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> magazines. Although prepared in August, the publications contained an ad urging members to call members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to vote against the waiting period. `` People saw in the magazine it still was not resolved,'' <PERSON> Conover </PERSON> said, and apparently turned a steady stream of contacts with lawmakers into a last-minute flood. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Handgun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, saying law enforcement uniformly supported the waiting period, brought hundreds of uniformed police officers to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as lobbyists. But months before, the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> had begun compiling names of police officers who backed the gun lobby's positions and opposed the waiting period. Two weeks ago, the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> brought its police backers to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members began receiving visits by rank-and-file officers from both sides. The pro-Brady police officers were given space in a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> office building by the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, whose chairman, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, supported their cause. They turned the hearing room into a command center, directing the lobbying effort. The pro-NRA police had breakfast each morning at the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> cafeteria, and then were bused to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. `` When more than 100 rank-and-file police officers came to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and, in their own words, argued against a waiting period, that had a big effect,'' <PERSON> Conover </PERSON> said. `` It showed what we had been saying, but had not demonstrated: that law enforcement was not united on this issue.''

 Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> weakened to a tropical storm as it blustered northwestward today but it threw tornadoes and sheets of rain at thousands of shuttered evacuees along the <LOCATION> Texas-Mexico </LOCATION> border. At least 109 people have been killed and more than 800,000 left homeless since <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> ripped through the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> with 175 mph wind earlier this week, then crossed the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> before slamming into northeastern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. One person died today in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> after being injured in a tornado. But by this morning, the once massive storm's maximum sustained winds had flagged to 65 mph, nine less than hurricane strength, and forecasters said the eye had all but disappeared. However, they warned of continued danger from flash flooding inland. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was downgraded to a tropical storm at 6 a.m. EDT as it proceeded 50 miles southeast of the city of <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rishnychok </PERSON>, a meteorologist with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. Winds were still weakening as the storm moved west-northwest at 12 mph, he said. Gulf Coast residents expressed relief that the storm, which earlier was deemed the most powerful ever tracked in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>, pulled its punch as it came ashore despite delivering a spate of tornadoes. `` We're thankful,'' said <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>. `` What could have been one of the most deadly storms in history appears to have missed us.'' <PERSON> Corpus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christi </PERSON> residents who evacuated were eager to return, but <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said, `` We're saying do n't do it because of the flooding.'' At least a dozen tornadoes peppered southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> today, following 14 on Friday, killing one woman, striking a hospital complex, military bases and a mobile home park, authorities said. Some injuries were reported. At 6 a.m. CDT, the center of the storm was in northern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> near latitude 25.0 degrees north and longitude 99.8 west, or about 150 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, located at the southernmost tip of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s remnants should bring very heavy rains to <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> valley before heading north up the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> as a `` huge rain-making machine,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>, meteorologist at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` The danger of flash flooding in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is very great,'' <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON> said. `` Rainfall as high as 10 to 15 inches _ maybe even 20 inches _ is expected.'' By midweek, the storm should be in the lower <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and end up in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> as nothing more than foul weather, forecasters said. `` The people in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> better dust off their umbrellas,'' <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, responsible for billions of dollars in damage during a weeklong rampage across the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, barreled ashore Friday afternoon in <LOCATION> Tamaulipas </LOCATION> state, a sparsely populated area of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> about 120 miles south of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>. The eye passed over <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rosa </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, two small villages a few miles north of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pesca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, where ocean tides coursed over two miles of flatlands and into the town. `` We presume -LRB- the Mexican villages -RRB- are getting a good pounding from 120 mph winds,'' <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON> said Friday. Thousands of people evacuated in areas of northeastern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, including the entire beach area of <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, a city of 280,000 just across the border. To the south, about 300,000 people were homeless in <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> state and 10,000 more were homeless in <LOCATION> Campeche </LOCATION>, on the west coast of the peninsula, the government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> said. The storm had left more than 500,000 homeless in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> earlier in the week. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, heavy rains fell on <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, with gusts up to 82 mph recorded at nearby <LOCATION> Padre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, but the vulnerable coastal area escaped the worst of the storm. Police in nearby <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> said the windows of 20 to 30 cars in a parking lot were shattered by high winds or a tornado. Low-lying coastal roads were closed by high water. About 125 shelters holding 50,000 people were open in a four-county area of southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> around <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lohman </PERSON>. When the eye of the storm passed to the south, evacuees were eager to return to their homes. `` We're going home. We think everything is going to be OK,'' <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> said Friday night, leaving a <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> shelter into a downpour. `` We do n't think it's going to get bad and there was no need to stay here anymore.'' Others, however, were more cautious. `` I would n't want to go home and then have my family hurt by a tornado,'' said <PERSON> Praxedis </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, who was at a shelter with his pregnant wife and son. Elsewhere, most of the estimated 25,000 people evacuated in southern <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and 20,000 in the island city of <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> were allowed to return home Friday. In <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, tornadoes were reported in seven counties, uprooting trees but causing no major damage or injuries. One <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> drowning was indirectly related to the hurricane. A 3-year-old boy fell from his family's shrimp boat when they moved the vessel for safe mooring, officials said.

<TEXT>
 Rains from Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> sent a river raging over its banks in <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>, sweeping at least 10 policemen to their deaths and overturning buses loaded with evacuees from <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, police said today. The flooding occurred in <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>, an industrial city of 3 million people, located 110 miles from the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> border and 140 miles inland from <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>. At least 10 police officers were swept away while on a rescue mission around midnight, a judicial police officer said. Several buses loaded with evacuees overturned in the raging water and more were feared drowned. The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said early today it had been raining for more than 24 hours. A trailer truck also slid into the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Catarina </LOCATION> river in the driving rain and its two occupants were missing, the local newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norte </ORGANIZATION> said. Recreational areas with soccer fields, basketball courts, tennis courts and jogging trails have been built along the river in the last few years. <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> is a major northern industrial center and the capital of <LOCATION> Nuevo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leon </LOCATION> state. The <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Catarina </LOCATION> river crosses <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>. The storm slammed into <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for the second time in a week Friday afternoon. The eye of 450-mile-wide hurricane, with 120 mph winds, crossed onto land at 5:35 p.m. EDT, sweeping ashore in a sparsely populated area 120 miles south of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, weather reports said. Although the storm had lost much of its muscle, it caused floods and mudslides after it barreled into <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Earlier in the week, <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> killed at least 29 and left 300,000 people homeless in the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. The hurricane has killed at least 109 people, including one in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, 39 in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, 26 in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, 30 in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, five in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and eight in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. However, the death toll is expected to rise. In <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> just across the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, the storm felled trees, downed power lines and flattened dozens of tin shack homes on the evacuated beachfront. About 5,000 people were evacuated inland. Nearly two dozen tornadoes were reported around <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>. Much of the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> remained without communications and supplies today. At 9 a.m. EDT today, <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s center was located near latitude 25.1 north and longitude 100.3 west, or 185 miles west southwest of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> and 40 miles south of <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Maximum sustained winds were estimated to be near 50 mph and the storm was expected to weaken further during the next 24 hours. The center said rainfall of 10 to 15 inches was accompanying the storm with up to 20 inches locally. Flash floods were likely, it said. The storm was moving west-northwest at about 12 mph, and was expected to follow that track through midday today before turning gradually to the northwest, forecasters said. In <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, officials said the worst part of the storm appeared to have passed. `` Up to now the damages are not considered very grave,'' said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Inez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> government spokesman. Officials distributed crackers and water to thousands of people in shelters and rged them to stay put until the storm ended. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> hit <PERSON> Soto </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Marina </PERSON>, a town of 8,000 people 20 miles inland from <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pesca </LOCATION> on late Friday, its mayor told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone. `` There is considerable material damage to the town. It is still raining very hard,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinojosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortina </PERSON>. `` We will just have to stay in and wait until tomorrow to survey the situation.'' <PERSON> Hinojosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortina </PERSON> said about 3,000 refugees from <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pesca </LOCATION> were sheltered in <LOCATION> Soto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> la </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> but other coastal residents had not been evacuated or decided to ride out the storm. The <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tamaulipas </LOCATION>, a small mountain range between <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> and the coast, should blunt the hurricane's strength, said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>, a meterologist at the National Hurricane Center. <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON> expected the last of hurricane-force winds today. But he predicted very heavy rains as warm hurricane winds rise into cooler mountain air, possibly causing flash floods and mudslides. The Mexican armed forces began emergency flights Friday of food, medicines and water to <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cozumel </LOCATION> and other disaster sites in the Yucatan. In many locations, hurricane victims were without food, drinking water, electrical power, gasoline and communications since Wednesday.

<TEXT>
 The newly renovated boyhood home of President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> opened to the public Saturday and the federal official who oversaw the completion of the 19-year project was delighted. `` I'm very excited. I feel like we've really done something important,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Kesselman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> superintendent for the house. `` It looks great, if I do say so myself.'' The 18-room, three-story house includes five furnished rooms, exhibition rooms and work space for Park Service staff. <PERSON> Taft </PERSON>, the only American to serve as both president and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chief justice, was born at the house in 1857. His father, <PERSON> Alphonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON>, bought the house and its 1.82 acres for $ 10,000 in 1851, after moving from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and added a wing for more space. The family sold the house in 1899 and auctioned off many of the furnishings. Park Service officials had no original blueprints to guide the restoration. They had only an 1868 photograph of the house, with young <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> in the front yard, to show the home's 19th century appearance. <PERSON> Taft </PERSON>, a lawyer who made his national reputation by serving as civil governor of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and later as secretary of war under President <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, was the nation's 27th president, from 1909 to 1913. <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> lost a re-election bid to <PERSON> Woodrow </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and served as chief justice from 1921 to 1930. He died in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in March 1930, a few weeks after resigning from the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The house, built in the 1840s, was acquired by the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in 1969. <PERSON> Kesselman </PERSON>, who arrived in 1985 to direct the final stages of restoration, said the total job cost $ 3 million of public and private funds. The private Friends of <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Birthplace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> raised nearly $ 600,000 of that total to buy furniture. Some furniture was donated.

<TEXT>
 The destructive force of Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> has put this <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> resort, popular with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and other tourists, out of commission for up to three months, <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>'s mayor said. Nearly 6,000 tourists were stranded in the resort area Friday and 2,000 other vacationers were in the neighboring resort island of <LOCATION> Cozumel </LOCATION>, just south of <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>. With <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION> still without electricity or telephone service after <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> hit Wednesday, the tourist industry's priority today was `` to get the tourists out of here,'' said <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Cancun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> Mayor <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <PERSON> Zapata </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>'s luxury beachfront hotels, many flooded and windowless, `` should be operating by December.'' The tourist high season starts on Dec. 15. Tourism Minister <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Enriquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Savignac </PERSON> was more optimistic, saying that damages to <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>'s hotels would be repaired within six weeks. <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON> said it was too early to estimate financial losses suffered by <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>'s tourist industry when <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> slammed into the city with 160 mph winds. At least 39 people died in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in the storm, which forecasters have called the most intense on record. He said a figure would have to wait `` until experts come in to evaluate the damage.'' About 1,500 tourists jammed the local airport Friday afternoon waiting for a flight out. Eleven commercial flights left <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION> Friday from an airport working only during daylight hours because its control tower suffered serious damages. Temporary controller equipment was being shipped in from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Among the most seriously damaged of the nearly 50 beachfront hotels were the Club Med and the Presidente. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowley </PERSON>, a Club Med employee from <LOCATION> Whittier </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said about half the luxury resort's installations were destroyed by the hurricane.

<HEAD>Trustee Says Two New PTL Bidders; Ministry Trims Services,
Expenses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT MILL, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s bankruptcy trustee says he is considering two new bids for the ministry's assets this weekend as he prepares to recommend a buyer to a federal bankruptcy judge. `` I hope we can finish it up by Monday,'' Trustee M.C. `` Red'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said Friday night. In a separate development, ministry officials said they were suspending some service programs at the troubled ministry, including a home for unwed mothers-to-be, to save money. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said one new bidder is a <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, businessman, but he refused to reveal his name. Another bid came from a group of private investors from the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> areas, <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said. The Charlotte -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Observer quoted unidentified sources as saying the private investors offered about $ 200 million, $ 50 million in cash. The Canadian man, the newspaper reported, wants an option on the assets until Dec. 31. If he then bought the property, he would pay $ 115 million including $ 50 million in cash. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said if he could not make a recommendation on a buyer to Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> by Monday, he would request another deadline extension to accept more bids. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> has given <LOCATION> Benton </LOCATION> until Sept. 27 to choose a buyer or liquidate <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s assets. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, businessman who had previously offered $ 113 million, remains a possible buyer, <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said, adding, `` I think <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> is still right in there.'' <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> has been in bankruptcy proceedings since June 1987, three months after founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> left amid a sex-and-money scandal. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> has said that if <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> and its large Christian theme park near here are n't sold by Oct. 1, he will order the ministry closed. Earlier this month, <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> described <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> as the leading bidder for the property, but the proposed deal apparently fell through when <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> could n't prove he had the financing to reclaim his ministry. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, interim president of <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> officials have suspended the operations of their home for unwed mothers, adoption service and home for homeless or drug-addicted men. The suspension will save the ministry $ 3,000 a day in operating costs, said <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. The minstry had found homes for the two girls still living at the unwed mothers facility and were looking for places to send the men.

 A car slammed into a line of people waiting to buy tickets to a concert by rock star <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> early Saturday, killing a 17-year-old and injuring five other people, police said. The driver of the car, a 21-year-old <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> man, told police he was rear-ended by another vehicle, but police said they would charge the man Monday with vehicular homicide, running a red light and driving to endanger. `` They were on line and at about 1:45 a.m., this individual lost control of his car,'' said <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>. He said the car crossed a median and crashed into a line of people waiting to buy tickets at a record store. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said the 17-year-old, whose name was withheld pending notification of relatives, was pronounced dead at <ORGANIZATION> Beth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. Five other people were taken to two other hospitals, he said. The 21-year-old driver was released.

<HEAD>Soviet Press In Rare Critique Of Polish Leadership</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Poland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Polish leadership must share the blame with strikers and protesters for many of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s problems, the state-run Soviet press said in a rare critique of a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> ally. The daily newspapers <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> suggested in commentaries Friday that Polish workers were driven to strike by the government's mishandling of sharp price increases in the spring. Trust in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s government has eroded so badly that the leadership may not survive, <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Will the incumbent government stay in power or will it resign? This issue has become a political reality and will be discussed by the Polish parliament,'' wrote <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Runov </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> correspondent for the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency. His dispatch appeared in <LOCATION> Sovietskaya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rossiya </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said recent unrest should not cause the Polish government to back away from reforms. `` The country has approached a point in the process of socialist renovation and democratic development where it should n't stop. Further steps forward are necessary to overcome dogmatic and sketchy thinking,'' said correspondent <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Toporkov </PERSON>. `` One should compromise, each to the other.'' <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> said the strikes and their aftermath are just another step in democratization. `` But at the same time, economic decline is occurring. Progress in reform over the last two or three years has been small and the workers themselves have failed at reform,'' the newspaper said. When protests swept <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> earlier this year, the Soviet media called the strikes `` groundless and harmful both from the political and economic viewpoints.'' Commentaries carried by the papers then also accused Western countries of agitating strikers. The latest wave of strikes in August posed the most serious threat to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s government since it imposed martial law and banned Solidarity in 1981. <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, leader of the independent union federation, agreed to end the strikes after the government agreed to talks on legalizing the movement. `` On Aug. 20, when the strike wave reached its culmination point, it was clearly determined that the workers' protest in major cases is resistance to the failed economic policy conducted recently,'' <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> said. The Polish government this year raised prices 42 percent, a move officials said was necessary to balance goods with the money supply. Thousands of workers struck in protest and another wave of strikes began in August. <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s council of ministers was given extraordinary power to push through economic reforms, but `` it has n't given any tangible results.'' <PERSON> Runov </PERSON> said the government has responded with immediate measures to speed the country's economic reform program, but `` a problem of trust in the government is still an open one.''

<HEAD>University Heart Transplant Surgeon Ousted As Division Head</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A world-renowned heart and lung transplant surgeon has been ousted from his position as head of the division of cardiovascular surgery at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON> was relieved temporarily in early August during an investigation into assorted allegations, among them a never-proven claim that he or one of his assistants left a forceps inside a patient's chest and then did not inform the patient of the fact. In a brief news release offering no explanations, the hospital said Friday that `` after considerable thought and external consultation, a decision has now been made not to reinstate Dr. <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON>'' to his leadership post. It said he continues as a professor of surgery and a member of the hospital staff. The August announcement came after the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> reported that the university was investigating <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON> in connection with two operations. The newspaper later said its account of one of the operations should not have been published because it was based on sources who lacked firsthand knowledge. The <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> last month quoted sources as saying the move for <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON>, 40, to temporarily step aside was partly the result of a sharp dispute over the surgeon's personality and aggressive management style. The announcement Friday of surgery department chairman Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Najarian </PERSON>'s decision not to reinstate <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON> capped weeks of tension at the hospital over the matter. Hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said that because the decision involves confidential personnel matters, the reasons for <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON>'s ouster `` probably will never be discussed in a public forum. There was no comment from <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Najarian </PERSON>; both have failed to return repeated phone calls from reporters since the Aug. 2 announcement. <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON> was hired by <PERSON> Najarian </PERSON> in January 1986 from <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, where he was a protege of famed heart surgeon and <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> alumni Dr. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Shumway </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shumway </PERSON>'s daughter, a newly trained heart surgeon, recently joined <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON>'s staff. `` I thought he was the best cardiac surgeon available in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He was our No. 1 choice,'' <PERSON> Najarian </PERSON> said in May 1986, soon after <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON>'s arrival. At the time, <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON> was president-elect of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplantation </ORGANIZATION>. He is among a handful of surgeons in the world trained in combined heart-lung transplants, and has performed seven heart-lung transplants at <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. There are two other heart transplant surgeons among the five cardiac surgeons on the university staff, but <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON> is the most experienced and the only one who has done heart-lung and single-and double-lung transplants. Dr. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, chief of heart surgery at the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Snelling </LOCATION>, will serve as interim head of cardiovascular and thoracic surgery until a permanent head is appointed, the statement said. University Vice President for Health Sciences Dr. <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanselow </PERSON> said he reviewed <PERSON> Najarian </PERSON>'s action and supports it. `` These are tough and gray areas where anyone could make a mistake, but I feel reasonably comfortable about this one,'' <PERSON> Vanselow </PERSON> said.

 British boxer <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON>, the No. 1 contender to <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s heavyweight crown, shielded his family with his body while the 200 mph winds of Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> pounded <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, a newspaper reported Saturday. Nothing had been heard from the 26-year-old boxer, on vacation in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> with his girlfriend, <PERSON> Laura </PERSON>, and their daughters <PERSON> Nicola </PERSON>, 6, and <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON>, 2, since the hurricane struck the island last Monday. But on Saturday the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, which tracked them to their hotel at the beachside resort of <LOCATION> Negril </LOCATION>, told how <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> had shielded his family with his 228-pound body while the storm battered the holiday complex. `` It was worse than anything you can imagine,'' the Mail quoted <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> as saying. `` There was nothing to do but duck down, box clever and pray and hope it would go away. `` Nothing can scare me now. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> will be a breeze after this little lot,'' the boxer, whose title fight with the American has been postponed twice, was quoted as saying. <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> would not have been on vacation at all had his title fight with <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, originally scheduled for <LOCATION> Wembley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> Oct. 8, not been delayed. The champion suffered a concussion in a car crash at his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state home two weeks ago and no new date has been fixed. The Daily Mail said other guests at <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON>'s hotel talked with admiration of the fighter's efforts to protect his family and help local villagers replace tin roofs on their shattered homes. They quoted West German engineer <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Oesterle </PERSON>, vacationing at the same hotel as <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON>, as saying: `` He is a big man in every way with a big heart. He worked like a Trojan to help clear up the mess and he was out among the guests cheering them up. `` He told me that during the height of the storm his family was very frightened, crouching on the floor, and he used his big arms and body to protect them,'' <PERSON> Oesterle </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> told the newspaper: `` Quite frankly we were all shocked. We did not think it was going to be as serious as it was even though we had a warning.'' In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON>'s manager <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawless </PERSON>, who spent four days trying to contact the fighter, said, `` Thank God he's safe.

 Anti-Marxist rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> Mozambique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> killed 46 soldiers from <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> during clashes in the last month, the rebels claimed Saturday. The rebels released the statement in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> one day after Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> on the last part of a 10-day tour of southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> urged <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s Marxist-oriented leaders to begin peace talks with the rebels In the statement, rebel movement leader <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhlakama </PERSON> said he hoped <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s visit would contribute to peace in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, one of the world's poorest nations and one that has been wracked by internal war since it gained independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1975. On Monday, the rebels declared a cease-fire in three areas of the country so residents could attend Masses celebrated by the pope. The rebel statement said its forces on Sept. 1 attacked barracks housing <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> government troops and <LOCATION> Zimbabwean </LOCATION> forces, killing nine Mozambican and seven Zimbabwean soldiers. The statement said rebel forces on Monday killed 20 <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> government soldiers and nine Zimbabweans in clashes near <LOCATION> Vila </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mungari </LOCATION>, southwest of the coastal city of <LOCATION> Beira </LOCATION>. The rebel forces disputed what they said were government claims that rebel commander General <PERSON> Calisto </PERSON> <PERSON> Meque </PERSON> was killed in combat by Mozambican troops in central <LOCATION> Zambezia </LOCATION> province. The statement said <PERSON> Meque </PERSON> is alive and commanding rebel units in <LOCATION> Zambezia </LOCATION>. The rebels also claimed they killed a government officer late last month in an ambush in northern <PERSON> Cabo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delgado </PERSON> province. The government forces _ backed by Zimbabwean, <LOCATION> Tanzanian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malawian </LOCATION> troops _ have been fighting the right-wing guerrillas in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> since 1975. The bitter struggle has forced 1 million Mozambicans to flee to neighboring countries and caused famine among an estimated 6 million of the country's 14.5 million inhabitants. The rebel forces, whose estimated 12,000 to 22,000 guerrilla fighters formerly received backing from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, have been accused of slaughtering civilians. The rebels deny the allegations.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> operated a secret chemical weapons factory during World War II, bombed <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> with poison gas grenades and tested poison on prisoners of war, including Americans, a new report charges. The report in the October issue of the Chicago-based Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists also contends the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government knew about <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s use of chemical weapons but failed to prosecute Japanese officers at the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> war crimes tribunal in 1946. The report's author, <PERSON> Yuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON>, speculated the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government decided against prosecuting because it wanted to learn from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s knowledge of bacteriological warfare `` The use of chemical weapons -LRB- by the Japanese -RRB- was covered up by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government,'' <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON> said Saturday in a telephone interview from his home in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON>, a lecturer in Japanese at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adelaide </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, drew on newly discovered Japanese war documents, his own interviews and previously published material to piece together the account, said <PERSON> Len </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackland </PERSON>, the Bulletin's editor. `` I think what you have here is the first full story of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s poison gas enterprise and its grim results both on the Chinese and on the Japanese workers,'' he said Friday <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON> said his research was prompted partly by the Japanese government's long-time insistence that it never used chemical weapons in World War II. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> signed the 1925 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Convention that banned use of such weapons. <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON> said his research showed that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> built a factory for chemical weapons on <LOCATION> Okunoshima </LOCATION>, one of dozens of tiny islands in the <LOCATION> Inland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. To help keep the factory secret, <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON> contends, the Japanese government erased the island from maps in 1939. The factory operated from 1929 until the end of World War II, when it was destroyed at the direction of Allied officers. The plant manufactured a variety of chemicals, including mustard gas, lewisite, nausea gas and hydrocyanic acid gas for use against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON>'s report said. Neither the Japanese nor <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governments would respond to the report in the Bulletin, a monthly magazine founded in 1945 and supported by scientists concerned about the implications of nuclear weapons development. The Japanese foreign ministry would not make an official comment despite repeated calls from The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. But a <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> official said, `` We have not gathered enough evidence to specify it as a historical event.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and State departments also declined comment on the report through several public affairs officers, all of whom refused to be identified. Atrocities committed during the Japanese invasion of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which began shortly before World War II, have long been a source of controversy between the two countries. Chinese army records allege that at least 2,000 Chinese were killed and 35,000 injured by Japanese chemical weapons, <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON>'s report said. <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON> wrote that in 1983, researchers from <ORGANIZATION> Keio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> obtained a two-volume report on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s experiments with bacteriological and chemical weapons on Chinese, Soviet, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Polish prisoners in the early 1940s. The article gave no detail on the tests on Americans but said Chinese were subjected to mustard gas attacks and it quoted research notes on the resulting damage to their skin. In another test, Chinese prisoners had to drink a liquid form of the chemical; in a third, some of the liquid was dropped in the eye of a prisoner, <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON> reported. Documents do not say what happened to the prisoners. In his article, <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON> contends that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Col. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON>, a law officer assigned to investigate Japanese war crimes, uncovered evidence of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s use of chemical weapons and wrote two reports about it. But <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON> said <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON> `` was summoned home abruptly'' from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> in the early stages of the war crimes trials, `` and the issue was dropped, possibly because the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government was interested in keeping information relating to biological and chemical warfare for its own use.'' `` My intention was to warn of the danger of chemical weapons,'' <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON> said. `` So I hope the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and other major countries which are producing chemical weapons will reconsider.'' The report also said medical specialists from <ORGANIZATION> Hiroshima </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> have tracked nearly 5,800 former employees of the chemical weapons factory who suffered lasting injuries from working with the substances. `` Cancer of the respiratory organs is particularly high, suggesting a direct link with the inhalation of poison gas,'' the report said. One worker `` recalled in an interview that the factory was so contaminated that workers had to keep an eye on caged parakeets, which dropped dead when gas leakage rose,'' the report said.

<TEXT>
 Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, finishing a four-day Southern campaign swing, declared Saturday that Democrats who voted for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1980 and 1984 are `` coming back in droves.'' The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator told an enthusiastic, partisan audience in a small college auditorium that his ticket represented `` the difference between performance and promise. It's a message we understand here in the South.'' `` I've spent a lot of time in the last month going around visiting ... Democrats that have voted for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>,'' he said. `` And I've gone to them and said, ` Come home' ... and they're coming back in droves.'' Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had failed in his role as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s appointee to lead the fight against drug imports in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said `` And now <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants a promotion,'' he said, drawing laughter from the crowd. `` And he wants to pass the torch of failure on to the junior senator from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> spoke in front of a huge <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag, behind a collection of nautical items including a ship's wheel and lobster traps. On the stage with him was Sen. <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., with whom <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has gone quail hunting in the past `` We're opening <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> season a little early this year,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, repeating one of his favorite lines. In this conservative area of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> panhandle, near two major military installations, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> tried to underline what he said was a commitment to a strong defense by Democratic nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` Our message to the new South, our message to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, is strength and stability for national defense,'' he said. `` We support a strong nuclear deterrent. We support the triad, powerful reliable strategic weapons on the land, in the air and under the sea,'' he said. He did not mention <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' opposition to two programs for modernizing the land-based leg of the triad, the MX and Midgetman missiles. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> himself has supported both of those programs. <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON> described <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as `` the third senator from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'' for all the work he's done for the state. But even enthusiastic supporters in the audience doubted the panhandle would go for the ticket. `` You're in the middle of the redneck <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, who was the area's lone <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delegate to the Democratic National Convention. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, Democratic chairman of nearby <LOCATION> Okaloosa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took the area 65 percent to 35 percent last time. `` The comparison with four years ago is like night and day,'' he said. `` We've got a fighting chance at even this time,'' he said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Saturday afternoon to attend to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> business on Monday.

<TEXT>
 Armed <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks and students took over a government building Saturday, forcing 24 soldiers to surrender in the latest escalation of unrest threatening to topple the authoritarian government. The occupation of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> building in downtown <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> was believed to be the first in which a government office in the capital was taken over by protesters fighting to end 26 years of repression under the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The soldiers first opened fire on the protesters and slightly wounded three people. They later surrendered and were disguised as protesters with red headbands and allowed to escape, witnesses said. Mobs outside the building had threatened to behead the guards. The shooting was believed to be the first time soldiers fired on demonstrators since the Aug. 8-12 rioting that ousted hard-line President <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> and left 112 people dead by the government's count They previously shot only at escaping prisoners and mobs of looters. Elsewhere, three people accused of offering poisoned water to protesters two weeks ago were beaten to death by a mob and beheaded after the monks released them from custody, witnesses said. Up to 500,000 demonstrators, including striking government workers and policemen, took part in peaceful marches in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, carying placards that said, `` If we do n't get it -LRB- democracy -RRB-, we will hit out.'' Western-educated lawyer <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> took over Aug. 19 as the first civilian leader since the 1962 military coup, but protesters have rejected his plan for the ruling party to supervise a general election under a multiparty system. They have demanded an interim government be formed to conduct the polling. Witnesses said the troops guarding the ministry building opened fire after a surging group of protesters surrounded the building and threatened to set it ablaze. Clambering over adjacent rooftops, students entered the top floor of the four-story structure. Twenty-four soldiers inside surrendered to monks, who drove them away after seizing a submachine gun and several semi-automatic weapons. Protesters also ringed the City Hall and <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> buildings nearby and shots were heard, but there apparently was no bloodshed. After reinforcements arrived, about 100 soldiers were posted at both buildings. Security forces have sided with protesters in towns including <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> in the southernmost province of <LOCATION> Mergui </LOCATION>. On Sept. 9, 500 servicemen joined protest marches in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> in the first major military defections. State-run Radio <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> Saturday urged army personnel to return to their duties and work toward `` consolidating sovereignty, national unity.'' Opposition leaders, who were believed to be negotiating with the government on formation of an interim administration, have tried to prevent violence. On Friday, leading dissident <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> defused a potentially bloody confrontation between soldiers and 100,000 demonstrators moving on the heavily guarded <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> compound with spears, swords and knives. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, a former army brigadier, told the crowd, `` We can not blame these soldiers for the faults of some of their commanders.'' Street protests have persisted despite a series of concessions by <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s government. The latest, announced by <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> Friday, said all military personnel and civil servants must resign from the ruling party and not become members of any future political parties. It said the decision was made at the recommendation of the commission that is to supervise the elections, which may occur in October. Two-thirds of the 2.5 million party members come from military and civil service ranks. Many government workers said Saturday they would not heed a government warning to return to work by Sept. 26 or face punishment. Virtually all the workers have been on strike since Aug. 8, paralyzing the adminstration. One effect of the strikes has been the price of rice, the staple food, has tripled in recent weeks. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday it would donate $ 500,000 to religious organizations to buy rice for needy residents. With the political instability, most embassies have evacuated dependents of their diplomatic staffs and non-essential personnel. A number of Japanese were evacuated Saturday to <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> after the embassy in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> urged the remaining 108 Japanese there to leave. About 100 Americans had left earlier. Security forces killed scores of people in quelling student-led protests in March and June. That set the stage for the July 23 resignation of Ne Win, who had ruled since he staged the 1962 coup. More protests flared after <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> succeeded him. The government said security forces killed 112 people in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> before <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> resigned Aug. 12 after 17 days in power, but Western diplomats said the death toll may have been much higher.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> saluted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Olympic athletes Saturday and urged Americans to `` remember, win, lose or draw, how much we have to be proud and thankful for.'' The president devoted most of his weekly radio address, delivered from the presidential retreat at Camp David in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Catoctin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, to the games that began Friday in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> The patriotic tone of the address recalled <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s acceptance speech at the 1984 Republican National Convention, in which he spoke of that summers's Olympics.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been `` non-combatant'' as the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's point man in the war on drugs and the grim toll has climbed, with `` more deaths, more wasted lives, more shattered families,'' a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat said Saturday. `` While <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in charge, he himself said the nation is losing ground in the war on drugs. That's because he's used only one weapon in the war: hot air,'' Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said in the Democratic response to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s weekly radio address. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> accused the vice president of supporting funding cuts to enforcement and drug treatment programs, slashing personnel and leading an ineffective border interdiction system that even the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> recommended be abolished. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> pointed to a survey of drug enforcement officials by the watchdog <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> that showed more than half believing that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s anti-drug programs had `` no effect'' or had `` somewhat worsened'' drug interdiction efforts.

 Here is the text of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> response to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s weekly radio address: Hello. I'm Congressman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Those of us along the U.S.-Mexico border live on the front lines of the war on drugs. You can walk into the desert from my home in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> any night and hear the drone of aircraft flying north with their deadly cardo. The Reagan-Bush administration's point man in the war on drugs is the man who would be president _ <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But the stubborn facts are these: While <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in charge, he himself said the nation is losing ground in the war on drugs. That's because he's used only one weapon in the war: hot air. While <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in charge, he tried to cut $ 238 million from drug enforcement funding for state and local police departments. While <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in charge, he tried to cut drug treatment funding by 50 percent. While <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in charge, not once did Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> demand economic sanctions _ under a law he said he wanted _ against countries that wo n't cooperate in the war on drugs. While <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in charge, 2,000 <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> personnel have been cut from the war on drugs. While <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in charge, the Reagan-Bush administration created the tough-sounding National Narcotics Border Interdiction System, but it worked so badly that the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said it should be abolished. While <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in charge, the Reagan-Bush administration tried to kill the program that helps state and local governments pursue drug traffickers. While <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in charge, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s drug-smuggling dictator, General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, was on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government payroll _ lining his pockets and returning the favor by lining our morgues with the bodies of our young people. While <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in charge, the cost of cocaine in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> plummeted 600 percent. While <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in charge, cocaine deaths doubled nationwide. While <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in charge, the grim drug toll has climbed _ more deaths, more wasted lives, more shattered families. The verdict of drug enforcement officials nationwide in a survey by the watchdog <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>? More than half said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s anti-drug program had `` no effect'' or had `` somewhat worsened `` drug interdiction efforts. And what's <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s latest proposal? Putting vice presidential hopeful <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in charge. You'll remember this is the fellow who, until last week, was n't even aware his boss had been directing the administration's anti-drug efforts. Imagine. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in charge of the war on drugs. How can he be put in charge of this war when he would n't fight in the last one? We still have n't forgotten the last time he was given the opportunity to carry a rifle for his country. This is a fellow who sat out the last war typing press releases in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. This is a fellow who voted to drop drug charges against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s indicted dictator. Putting the vice president in charge of the war on drugs is n't a new idea. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> tried it. It did n't work then. And it certainly wo n't work now under the country club direction of golfer <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. The stubborn fact is the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> have been noncombatants in the war on drugs. The <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION> is n't exactly worried at the thought that <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> might take aim at their deadly business with his press releases. Several days ago, the nation was shocked by the story of a little boy in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> named Shrimpy. Shrimpy worked for two years for drug dealers and lost a bag of crack. He got a bullet in his head from point-blank range. Shrimpy was 11 years old. The problem is n't just saying no to drugs. It's getting a new president and vice president who will say yes to fighting the war. This is Congressman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> for a drug-free <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Thank you, and have a good weekend.

 Here is the text of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s weekly radio address, delivered from Camp David, Md.: My fellow Americans, let me begin this talk with a special message to the people of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Last night, many of you endured the ravages of Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>. Today, as you wait for the waters to recede and the cleanup to begin, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> and I and all Americans hold you in our prayers. We all have one blessing to count: Warning came early. You were ready; so were we. The federal government has spent the last week preparing to help during and after the storm. We've offered help as well to our international friends who felt <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s full force. As I told Jamaican Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON>, we're ready to play an active role in helping them to rebuild. Now, on a happier note, if you're like me, you look forward every four years to a very special event: The Summer Olympics. As you know, this week and next, the Olympics are being held in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Last night, athletes from all over the world marched around the Olympic Stadium there and stood and watched as a single torch-bearer climbed the steps and lit the Olympic flame, marking the start of the Games. I'm sure that, like me, you'll be proud of all these young men and women, and particularly of our own American athletes. Our athletes are a remarkable group, not only for their achievements, but for how they represent so much of what is good and beautiful and splendid about this sweet and promised land. As Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said when, representing all of us, he saw them off two weeks ago, they stand for the country of the little guy, the country where no matter what the circumstances of your birth or background, you can go anywhere and do anything; where the millionaire has no more vote than the pauper; where the sense of possibilities is so palpable you can almost breathe it in the air. The Vice President was right, and I've always thought you could see the spirit of which he spoke in all our Olympic athletes. You can see it in the way so many of them will pause in their daily training in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, as our athletes have at past Olympics, to help competitors from countries where good coaching is hard, if not impossible, to find. You can see it in stories that have been told about American Olympians over the years, like the one about a boyhood hero of mine, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorpe </PERSON>. In the 1912 Olympics in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Thorpe </PERSON> took the gold in both the pentathlon and the decathlon. He was the most talked about competitor at those Games. With his medals won, <PERSON> Thorpe </PERSON> was presented to the King of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, who said, `` You, sir, are the world's greatest athlete.'' And what was <PERSON> Thorpe </PERSON>'s reply to this August European monarch? It was simple, straightforward and American. He said, `` Thanks, King.'' And you can see the American spirit in the lives of every one of our team members at these games. This team comes from all over our nation, from the rough-and-tumble streets of our brawny cities to the quiet lanes of our vast countryside; from the suburban hills of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to riverfront towns n the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>; they represent every aspect of our country's life, and a shining hope, too _ a crystalline beacon of opportunity that we know is the heart of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. One athlete, raised in very modest circumstances, recalled recently that, quote, `` We were rich as a family,'' unquote. And that wealth of love has given her the strength to achieve her dream, just as throughout our history the wealth of family love has given countless millions of Americans the strength to pursue their dreams in our land of opportunity. There's so much we have to be proud of in our Olympic team this year. In all teams, from all over the world, no group of young men and women is quite like them. They're filled with optimism for the future, with faith in the boundless possibilities of humanity, with zest for a life pursuing excellence, pursuing achievement, pursuing the limits of their God-given abilities, and piercing beyond what they thought were those limits. As an Olympic athlete from another nation recently marveled about our nation and its people, he said, `` In <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, they appreciate achievement and faith in the future. In fact,'' he said, `` it's a prerequisite for getting around.'' And he concluded, contrasting the energy of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to other countries he had known, `` For everybody in the street in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, every day is a competition.'' Yes, our athletes have a love, a happiness, and an exuberance in being American. They're as patriotic as the Pledge of Allegiance, as red, white, and blue as the flag. They are filled with the spirit of our land and all of its magnificent diversity, a diversity you can see, even in their faces. When you look at most other teams, it's easy to tell what continent or region they're from, but we Americans come from every continent and region. Ours are the faces of all humanity, just as our nation was built by the hopes of all humanity. So, as you watch these Olympics, remember, win, lose, or draw, how much we have to be proud and thankful for. After all, we're Americans Until next week, thanks for listening, and God bless you.

<HEAD>Israeli and Lebanese Forces Withdraw After Guerrilla Search</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Israeli forces and allied Lebanese militiamen withdrew to the Israeli-occupied security zone Saturday after a 24-hour search operation for guerrillas in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, police said. About 250 Israeli troops and militiamen of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in 29 tanks and armored vehicles pulled back to the security zone before dawn after searching a 24-square-mile area for guerrillas. A police spokesman said the Israelis and their allies `` did not face any resistance during the operation'' which was carried out just south of <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> army lines in the western sector of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Bekaa valley Five Lebanese citizens were wounded during the sweep, and shells severely damaged at least 15 houses in the villages of <LOCATION> Mimess </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ata </ORGANIZATION>, the spokesman said. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not say how the five were injured. The search was launched Friday hours after an Israeli army patrol foiled an infiltration attempt inside the security zone, killing three guerrillas. <PERSON> Talaat </PERSON> <PERSON> Yacoub </PERSON>'s pro-Syrian <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for the attack in a communique released in the southern port city of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. The attempted infiltration Friday was the second abortive attempt in six days to cross the six-to-10-mile security zone established by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. A week ago, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers captured four guerrillas after seriously wounding one of them in the zone. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> set up its security zone after withdrawing the bulk of its occupation army from southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in June 1985 after a three-year occupation. The zone is intended to serve as a buffer against cross-border raids. The strip is patrolled by about 1,000 Israeli troops and an equal number of militiamen. Also Saturday, gunmen wounded three Ghanaian peacekeepers serving with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in the southern town of <LOCATION> Abbasiyeh </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the gunmen chased the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> jeep and opened fire after it had an accident with a civilian car. `` The attackers escaped and civilians evacuated the three wounded Ghanaian soldiers to a hospital'' in the southern port city of Tyre, the spokesman said. He said the three Ghanians were admitted to <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION>'s field hospital at the border town of <LOCATION> Naqoura </LOCATION>. Their condition was satisfactory, he said. The 5,800-strong <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION>, with soldiers from nine countries, has been based in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since March 1978.

 Officials predicted disaster and talked of fingerprinting those who stayed behind to identify their bodies. Gulf coast residents from <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, to this tip-of-Texas town boarded up their windows and fled. But in the end, it was <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, `` the storm of the century,'' who stayed away _ turning out to be too big to turn north, too gracious to blast the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> coast. `` We were waiting for the storm, but it never showed up,'' said <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> as he used a crowbar to pry plywood off his family's barbecue hut. `` Some people are mad a little bit that they spent money and the hurricane never showed up.'' Meteorologists' predictions that <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, like past hurricanes, would turn north toward <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and strengthen after battering <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penninsula </LOCATION> proved wrong. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> hardly strayed from its west-northwest course. `` He was so large it was too hard to veer,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Flatt </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> here. `` It was controlling the weather pattern. The weather pattern was n't controlling it.'' Said <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, former director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and now weatherman for <ORGANIZATION> KHOU </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>: `` This storm was so big it just did its own thing and charged right into <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> dumped up to 6 inches of rain on areas and spun off deadly tornadoes that destroyed a few homes, damaged roofs and shattered windows. Across the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, as in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, the damage was widespread and severe. `` I do n't think anybody's going to feel this was the wrong thing to do,'' Corpus Christi Mayor <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said of the evacuation in her town, where thousands of residents crowded into shelters. `` This is n't new to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' said <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION> police chief <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>. `` People know what hurricanes can do. I think that should another one arise, they'll respond just as well.'' On <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, several hundred miles from where <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> hit, an evacuation order was under fire. And some in poor neighborhoods of this border town complained about the expense of hurricane preparations. But when the sky cleared, most said they held no hard feelings over the no-show hurricane. `` I'd rather be safe than sorry,'' said <PERSON> Rosbel </PERSON> <PERSON> Villarreal </PERSON>, who boarded up the home he recently bought here and took his family, including three young children, to a motel in <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>. `` I spent probably $ 150 but I did n't want to take a chance.'' `` Sometimes they hit here, sometimes they do n't. You never know,'' said <PERSON> Jeni </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinojosa </PERSON> as she swept up fallen leaves and branches from her yard. <PERSON> Guadalupe </PERSON> <PERSON> Longoria </PERSON> remembers more brutal storms here like <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Beulah </LOCATION>. But she stayed in her home alone, praying, all Friday night. `` I was expecting whatever the dear Lord sends us,'' she said. By Saturday morning, a steady stream of cars and campers returned to wind-whipped <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> and the city that had gone into hibernation returned to life. Lines formed at bakeries, and crews began picking up the fallen palms and branches. For five days reports on <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s brute force prompted coastal residents to batten down the hatches and prepare for a fierce storm that made its mark on history with the lowest recorded barometric pressure in the hemisphere. Thousands of residents evacuated, but most stayed, saying either they felt safe in their own homes and would tough it out, or they feared looters. Plywood shot up to $ 15 a sheet in some areas. There were long lines at grocery stores, and hotels hundreds of miles away took in <LOCATION> Gilbert </LOCATION> escapees. `` You've got to do it,'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said. `` The meteorologists made a mistake, but anybody can make a mistake. You never know with hurricanes.''

<HEAD>Solidarity Leader: Government Says Independent Union Has A Future</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CZESTOCHOWA, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government said Solidarity has a future in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> but refused to lift a 6-year-old ban on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first independent union federation, a union leader reported Saturday. `` They clearly said, ` Give us time,''' said <PERSON> Wladyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Frasyniuk </PERSON>, describing a meeting Friday between Solidarity chief <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, Interior Minister <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> and 22 other people from the government, Solidarity and the church. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> meanwhile traveled to this southern city Saturday for an annual workers' pilgrimage and to report to other Solidarity leaders about prospects for legalizing the union. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> agreed to end a wave of strikes last month after the government agreed to talk to Solidarity about legalization. The labor unrest posed the strongest challenge to the communist government since it crushed Solidarity in the 1981 martial law crackdown. The union was banned in 1982. Frasyniuk, Solidarity leader in in the southwestern city of <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION>, met with a small group of reporters early Saturday. He said <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> informed Solidarity members Friday that Solidarity has a future but told union activists that he could not take a decision on legalizing it now because his hands are tied. He said alternate Politburo member <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciosek </PERSON> told the meeting the police and army are resisting the push to legalize Solidarity because they `` fear this symbol.'' `` Can we call this a great success? I think not. Success will occur when Solidarity has the right to return to legal activity,'' <PERSON> Frasyniuk </PERSON> said. But he said the union `` can not involve itself in interminable discussions, because the people we represent expect concrete effects.'' <PERSON> Frasyniuk </PERSON> said Solidarity decided to continue talks even without a firm commitment because it did not want to be seen as being the first to break off the process of negotiation. After the meeting, Solidarity members had `` a feeling of victory,'' he said. `` You could see that the problem of Solidarity was the dominant one, and nobody directly attacked Solidarity.'' `` We now see that the legalization of Solidarity is n't one single act to grant or not. It is a process,'' said <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Bujak </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Solidarity leader. Newspapers on Saturday carried a brief government communique about the meeting and listed those who attended. But there was no confirmation of <PERSON> Frasyniuk </PERSON>'s account. In an unusual move, the Politburo of the Polish <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>' -LRB- communist -RRB- Party held a meeting Saturday to review `` the current problems of the socio-political situation of the country,'' the state-run news service <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said It gave no further details. The Politburo normally meets only on Tuesdays. The talks at a government villa outside <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> marked the first time a national delegation of Solidarity activists met with authorities and the official trade union alliance OPZZ, which was set up after Solidarity was banned. Although their union remains illegal, Solidarity members wore union pins during the meeting and were treated with respect by the officials present, <PERSON> Frasyniuk </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Stelmachowski </PERSON>, a pro-Solidarity law professor who served as a mediator to set up the meeting, said `` some bitter things were exchanged'' during the six hours of talks. He did not elaborate. The meeting was to discuss terms for large-scale talks on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s future, including the subject of Solidarity and trade union pluralism. The sides agreed that the talks would convene in mid-October. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> on Saturday for the <PERSON> Jasna </PERSON> <PERSON> Gora </PERSON> monastery in <LOCATION> Czestochowa </LOCATION>, site of the <PERSON> Black </PERSON> <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> painting, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s most revered icon. He was to attend a workers' pilgrimage that annually draws tens of thousands of Solidarity supporters. It was begun by the pro-Solidarity priest the Rev. <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Popieluszko </PERSON> before his murder by police agents in 1984. In the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, meanwhile, the state-run media softened their hard-line support of the Polish government. They said officials and protesters must share the blame for many of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s problems and that the two should compromise The daily newspapers <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> carried commentaries Friday suggesting that workers were driven to strike by the government's mishandling of sharp price increases in the spring. <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> said trust in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s government has eroded so badly that the leadership may not survive.

 <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s top law official pulled two `` Saturday Night Special'' handguns from underneath his business suit to make a point at a breakfast for gun control advocates. <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, the secretary of public safety and correctional services, pulled out the guns to illustrate how easily they could be concealed, stunning guests invited to Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON>'s fund-raising breakfast Friday morning. `` My God, it was so dramatic,'' said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donofrio </PERSON>, an advertising executive. `` Bishop does not dress in loose clothing. ... Not a bulge anywhere. `` All of a sudden, he gets a gun from inside his belt, and the next thing you know he's got this thing in the palm of his hand. He passes that one off to someone, reaches somewhere else and gets another gun,'' <PERSON> Donofrio </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> invited 40 supporters to the private breakfast to raise funds to back <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s handgun control bill, the first of its kind in the nation, whose fate will be decided in a referendum on the Nov. 8 ballot. After <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s demonstration, they came up with on-the-spot pledges of an estimated $ 75,000 to $ 100,000 to help support the bill. <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> signed the bill, which seeks to ban the sale of cheap handguns known as Saturday Night Specials, in May. However, a group called the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> the Gun Ban, with support from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, conducted a vigorous campaign to repeal the law, submitting enough petition signatures to bring the issue before state voters. Critics contend the law could lead to a ban on the sale of all new handguns. Defenders say it will only affect cheaply made Saturday Night Specials. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bereano </PERSON>, a top state lobbyist and supporter of the gun bill, said the breakfast was a signal that from the governor's standpoint the campaign to save the bill `` is going to be todus porkus _ whole hog.

<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Circle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has dropped a plan to limit medical-care coverage for employees because of `` lifestyle decisions,'' such as those who contracted AIDS or suffered from drug or alcohol abuse. `` Effective immediately, we have canceled implementation of these specific limitations due to the widespread misunderstanding of both the intent and the specifics of the changes,'' Circle K President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Reade </PERSON> said in a memorandum to employees. The memorandum, dated Tuesday, was made public Friday. In January, the Phoenix-based chain of convenience stores told its 26,000 employees that rising medical costs had forced it to implement a policy of not paying for the medical care of people suffering disease or injury as a result of lifestyles. The company does not buy health insurance, instead paying medical claims out of its own budget. The policy did not receive widespread attention until August, when it triggered complaints and demonstrations. Critics said it discriminated against victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Company officials said the policy was intended to apply only to employees hired since Jan. 1 _ limiting the number affected to about 3,000 _ and claimed <ORGANIZATION> Circle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION> never intended to investigate how employees became infected with AIDS, which is most often transmitted through homosexual sex or sharing of needles by intravenous drug abusers. However, the chain temporarily suspended the policy and gave it up this month. <PERSON> Reade </PERSON> said company learned from the flap that `` impressions and perceptions many times are more important than intentions. It's such a volatile and sensitive issue that I think no matter how carefully we explained it, we would have been misconstrued. `` I'm just delighted,'' said <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> AIDS Project. `` The biggest danger was always that other companies were going to follow their lead,'' she said. `` Now this is going to help keep everyone else in check.'' Other companies reportedly had considered similar steps in the face of increases of 20 percent to 30 percent a year in the cost of employee medical insurance and estimates by the federal government that, by 1991, the medical bill for AIDS will top $ 10 billion a year. The medical cost of alcoholism already is $ 13 billion a year.

 A book publisher bought land for a new headquarters in April while planning to publish a booklet predicting the beginning of the end of the world would occur in September. <PERSON> Norvell </PERSON> <PERSON> Olive </PERSON>, 47, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, spent $ 114,000 for the land as he arranged to publish the booklet, `` 88 Reasons Why the Rapture Will Happen in 1988.'' The booklet, written by <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, predicted that <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> would `` rapture the church'' and believers would be taken up to heaven during the Jewish new year. He initially said the ` rapture' would occur by sunset Tuesday but later revised it to Wednesday morning. <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON>, a retired engineer and self-taught Bible student, also said there would be seven years of plague, famine and nuclear war before <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s Second Coming. <PERSON> Olive </PERSON> said he went ahead with the purchase of the 3.13 acres of land in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> because negotiations had taken a long time. `` We had had a contract on the property for a year,'' <PERSON> Olive </PERSON> said. He said the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> would disperse profits from the booklet if the predictions in it do not come true by the end of the year. In a news release, the society did not say how the profits would be dispersed, and telephone calls to the society's officer were not answered Saturday. The organization estimated net proceeds at between $ 200,000 and $ 300,000. The society, a non-profit corporation Olive founded in 1979, said it has distributed more than 2 million copies of the booklet but more than 1 million books were given away free. The booklet, priced at 30 cents to $ 2 each, cost 15 cents to produce and is now out of print. `` The book has created a sweeping revival across the country,'' the news release said. `` It is estimated that up to 100,000 people may have made new confessions of faith.'' Orders for the booklet are still coming in but wo n't be filled, <PERSON> Olive </PERSON> said.

More than 5,000 people left shelters around town early Saturday after the main force of Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> passed through <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> about 100 miles to the south. `` I'm kind of glad to be back home. I did n't know what I was going to find. My house is 80 years old and I thought it was going to be blown away but it was n't,'' said <PERSON> Odilon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gracia </PERSON>, 75. He said he waited out the storm at an elementary school with a leaking roof and wet floors. `` I feel a little better in my house than at that school,'' he said. While the shelters emptied, the city grew congested. Restaurants and food stores closed for two days opened their doors again. Cars lined up at gas stations. Residents pried protective plywood from windows and doors and mopped up water that had leaked in. Others cut up fallen trees and hauled them away. Despite wind still gusting at more that 30 mph Saturday, work crews were out picking up dangling traffic lights and downed power lines that caused some temporary outages Friday. Southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> was spared the 120 mph wind that whirled around the eye of <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, but was battered by rain, high wind and tornadoes spun off by the system. `` I thought it was going to be worse, but thank God it was n't,'' said <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Zapata </PERSON>, 40, while she and her family picked up garbage strewn in their yard by the wind. `` I'm thankful it was n't as hard as it probably could have been or else everything here would have been blown away.'' <PERSON> Rosalinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Delgado </PERSON> and her three children spent the night in a shelter, and were relieved to find their home in good shape. `` I was scared, the children were scared, that we were n't going to have any furniture left when we got back. But everything seems to be OK,'' Ms. <PERSON> Delgado </PERSON> said.

 Pneumonia and eye and skin diseases have broken out in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> in the aftermath of floods that claimed at least 953 lives, doctors and officials said Saturday. `` Over 3,500 medical teams working in the flooded areas are not fully equipped to handle these new diseases,'' said one Health Ministry official. `` Most of them are not carrying enough medicines for these ailments.'' The government's toll of 953 from the flooding, which inundated about 80 percent of the country, is considered low. Newspapers put the toll in excess of 2,000. The government's figures include 211 deaths from diarrhea, caused by the disruption of pure water supplies when floodwaters washed away pumps and inundated wells. Most of the other deaths occurred from drownings, and a lesser number from bites by poisonous snakes. Flooding is an annual disaster in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, where the 110 million people earn an average per capita income of $ 150 per year. Last year, floods during the monsoon season killed at least 1,500 people. One doctor in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> said an `` unusually large number'' of patients from flood-affected areas are suffering from eye ailments and skin diseases. `` The daily average of such cases has increased four - to six-fold in the last one week,'' said the doctor, <PERSON> Abdur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> `` A week or 10 days back, the daily average of such patients was about 10. Now it is between 50 and 60 every day.'' At least 51,792 cases of diarrhea have been reported from flooded areas, where victims had little or no way to boil water. A government effort to bring water purification tablets to the countryside has been largely unsuccessful. The reports of the disease outbreaks come as the levels of major rivers in the low-lying country begin to recede. `` By next Friday, most of the water will recede, except from the low-lying areas close to the rivers,'' said one official at the Flood Control Center. The floods have inundated 53 of the country's 64 districts. But government efforts to get relief to an estimated 40 million people have been hampered by lack of communications and resources. Many outlying areas remain inaccessible by road, and there is little dry land for the few helicopters. But resumption last Friday of rail traffic between <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, the capital, and <LOCATION> Chittagong </LOCATION>, the country's main port, was expected to boost relief work. <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, one of the poorest countries in the world, relies heavily on imports. Ninety percent of its imports come through <LOCATION> Chittagong </LOCATION>.

 Lebanese presidential candidate <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Edde </PERSON> said Saturday he will not return home even if he wins an election scheduled for Thursday unless Israeli forces withdraw from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> met for more than two hours Saturday in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> with Syrian President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> to try to help <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> out of a political crisis threatening to re-ignite that country's civil war. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> Near </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> affairs, was accompanied by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s new ambassador to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Djerejian </PERSON>, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> desk at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. American and Syrian officials would not elaborate on the talks, although one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> source close to the delegation said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> may travel to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this weekend for meetings with Lebanese officials, including President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> have been trying to ensure a president is elected in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> before Friday, when <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s six-year term expires Under the constitution, he can not seek a second consecutive term. <PERSON> Edde </PERSON>, speaking in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, where he has been living since 1976 after three assassination attempts in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said the success of Thursday's vote was `` unfortunately'' dependent on the <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> negotiations. An attempt to convene <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s parliament Aug. 18 to elect a president collapsed when <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> deputies, opposed to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s candidate, former President <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON>, boycotted the session <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s U.S.-aided Christians oppose <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s efforts to impose a settlement to end the 13-year-old civil war. <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON> was the only serious contender until <PERSON> Edde </PERSON> announced his candidacy last week. <PERSON> Edde </PERSON>, a 75-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>, said once <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> withdraws its troops from a so-called `` security zone'' in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, he can ask <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to withdraw its forces. `` Without that, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is not independent, with the presence of both the Israeli and Syrian armies,'' said <PERSON> Edde </PERSON>, a former interior minister. The government-run Syrian press, after virtually ignoring <PERSON> Edde </PERSON>, quoted him Saturday as saying the presence of their army in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> was legal. The article was interpreted as a sign <PERSON> Edde </PERSON> is emerging as a compromise candidate in the discussions between the Syrian and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sides. <PERSON> Edde </PERSON> confirmed he said Syrian troops were in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> legally because they were invited there in 1976 by the Lebanese government and had a peacekeeping mandate from the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. But he said there would be no need for them once <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> withdrew. `` I am convinced there will be no more civil war if there is a withdrawal because I am confident in the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> people from both sides, both Moslem and Christian,'' he said. <PERSON> Edde </PERSON> said if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> did not withdraw he would not return to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and would instruct parliament instead to elect another president.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Hurricane Gilbert killed at least 30 people when it swept across <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s southern peninsula last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Haiti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disaster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preparedness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday. An agronomist said the storm destroyed huge tracts of crops in the south and predicted a faminie. Radio stations, which earlier reported 10 people died when their boat sank during the storm, broadcast the new government figures Saturday. `` It seems that 50 to 60 percent of agricultural production in the south has been destroyed. This means that we can expect a famine in that region within two months,'' <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Edouard </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexis </PERSON>, an agronomist and former dean of the <ORGANIZATION> Agronomy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said Saturday. The military government has declared a state of emergency in the three southern departments, where there is extensive damage to homes and heavy losses in livestock and fruit trees. Coastal roads were flooded and power lines blown down. The Canadian government has offered $ 50,000 in emergency relief to be channeled through the Roman Catholic Order of Oblate Fathers. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> announced a gift of $ 25,000 to the Haitian Red Cross for relief work. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>, president of the military government, expressed sympathy for the victims of the hurricane Friday night. `` The military government is conscious of its responsibilities and duties towards the nation and can not be insensitive and indifferent to the misfortune which has befallen us,'' <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> said. At least one political leader questioned why <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> had n't better spent money it has received in the past for hurricane protection measures. `` After all this time that <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> has been subject to the possible ravages of hurricanes ... and millions and millions of dollars have fallen into the hands of its rulers, with what structures of protection has the country been endowed?'' <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillipe-Auguste </PERSON> asked in a statement distributed to the press. <PERSON> Phillipe-Auguste </PERSON> was minister of agriculture under President <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>, who was overthrown by <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> in a military coup in June. Before the arrival of the hurricane, state and private radio stations broadcast the hurricane emergency instructions prepared by the disaster office, but no evacuation was announced.

<HEAD>Gilbert Leaves Grand Isle's Highway Just 100 Feet From Shore</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Hurricane Gilbert-US, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRAND ISLE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s waves washed away 25 feet of coastline, leaving the highway connecting the island to the mainland in danger if another storm hits the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, an official said Saturday. `` Now the state is really going to have to get into the scene because there is a threat to the highway,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Valence </PERSON>, who ordered the 2,000 inhabitants to evacuate during the storm. Altogether, he said, the resort community lost 100 feet of land from hurricanes <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>. Now <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Highway 1 is only 100 feet from shore in some places, he said. Grand Isle's losses are only a small part of the coastal erosion in a state which loses more than 50 square miles of coastal wetlands each year. But it's a significant amount for an island about a mile wide and eight miles long facing the open <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> due south of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. Other parts of the state apparently escaped <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s passage across the Gulf unscathed, aside from minor damage from a tornado Friday in <LOCATION> Slidell </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> will join <LOCATION> Valence </LOCATION> next week to survey the coastal damage to the state's only populated barrier island. <LOCATION> Valence </LOCATION> has been trying raise money to build two stone jetties to stop or at least slow down the erosion. The jetties were a major campaign platform for the new mayor, who took office 75 days ago. Since then, he's had to evacuate the island four times for hurricanes <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, and a tropical storm. <LOCATION> Valence </LOCATION> said that's a record for Grand Isle. `` People are very sensitive to weather conditions here,'' he said. `` At the same time, we're equally sensitive to <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isle </LOCATION>'s beauty and charm.'' <LOCATION> Valence </LOCATION> and about 12 emergency workers rode out the storm on the island. At its worst point Thursday night, the pounding of the surf created a salt mist that shorted out and exploded hundreds of power company transformer connectors. <LOCATION> Valence </LOCATION> lifted his evacuation order Saturday morning, but police dispatcher <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said many residents went home much earlier while <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was hitting <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` We started coming back Friday afternoon,'' she said. `` There was no water on the roads then.''

 A steady rain fell Saturday as a small wagon train departed from Red Clay State Historical Park for <LOCATION> Tahlequah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the infamous `` Trail of Tears.'' `` It's fitting,'' observed <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, the coordinator of the project. `` From what I've read, the first bunch of Cherokees were forced to leave on a day much like this one.'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Golconda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, drove one of the six covered wagons that will make the 1,000-mile journey, scheduled to end in early December. Participants hope to call attention to the federal government's forced removal of the Cherokees from their eastern homelands in 1838. `` I think the blackest chapter of our nation's history began with the Indian Removal Act of 1830 and culminated with the relocation of the Cherokees in 1838,'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said. `` The government called it a treaty but what it really amounted to was ... at gunpoint. They were made to leave their homes and walk to <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> so the white settlers could have their land.'' According to historical accounts of the trek, the first group of Cherokees, numbering about 1,000, departed Oct. 1, 1838, from <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clay </LOCATION>, their last tribal council ground in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. They were accompanied by federal troops and state militia. In all, 13 groups of Indians made the trek. `` About 4,000 of the Indians, or more than one-third of those who started out from <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> in the fall of 1838, died along the way,'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said. `` Yet, there are only two marked graves, in <LOCATION> Hopkinsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, along the entire route of the Trail Of Tears. It's a page of our history that's largely been ignored.'' The wagons that left <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clay </LOCATION> on Saturday were pulled by four mule teams and two teams of horses. A half-dozen riders on horseback also joined the first leg of the trek. Among the riders was <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, a farmer from <LOCATION> Woodbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, who said he first heard of the Trail of Tears as a little boy when he saw it mentioned on a plaque. <PERSON> Woodbury </PERSON> was one of the towns the Indians went through. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> is the project's <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> coordinator. `` This is an educational project and we'd like for people to come out and walk or ride with us for a while,'' he said. `` In my town, I know, the schoolchildren will be coming down to see the wagon train and learn more about what happened on the Trail of Tears.'' `` We want them to know that the Cherokees were n't savages in loincloths, that they were a civilized people whose land was stolen by the white man.'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said the wagons represent each of the six states the Cherokees went through on their way to <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. `` The Cherokees followed a circuitous route through <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, a route that later would be known as the Trail of Tears,'' he said. `` We're going to stay as close to that route as is possible. Prior to embarking, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> read a letter from <PERSON> Wilma </PERSON> <PERSON> Mankiller </PERSON>, the principal chief of the Cherokee Nation at <LOCATION> Tahlequah </LOCATION>. `` Those of you who are taking part in this commemoration of the Cherokee Trail of Tears can not conceive the human misery of those you now honor,'' she wrote. `` The Cherokee people had lived much like their rural southern neighbors. They were a settled, agricultural people with a democratic form of government. The effect of the removal was to thrust the Cherokee people back into the Stone Age.'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, an agricultural adviser, said he expects the trip to take 76 days, or about half as long as it took the Cherokees to get to <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. Participants are financing the trip out of their own pockets, except for $ 1,000 donated by the state of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, he said. `` I know we'll run into some problems along the way, but they wo n't be anything compared with the sacrifices the Cherokees had to make,'' he said.

 First-term Mayor <PERSON> Ygnacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> never wanted to be in the spotlight, but he has had a hectic summer dealing with a store roof collapse that killed 14 and coordinating efforts to prepare for a hurricane. By city charter, the mayor's post is not very powerful, but <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> has taken control of a city where several former top officials were accused of wrongdoing. <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, a 35-year-old certified public accountant who served as a city commissioner in 1979-83, said he stayed out of politics after his first venture because he did n't think it was for him. He returned last year to help manage his native city's administration after it was rocked by scandal `` Although the city charter gives the mayor very little power, the leadership has to be shown regardless of what the charter says,'' said <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, a 6-foot-6 man nicknamed `` Nacho.'' `` You have to assume a leadership role if you are going to lead a city through a crisis.'' On July 7, the roof of the <ORGANIZATION> Amigo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION> collapsed under the weight of torrential rain, trapping dozens and killing 14 people. <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> took control, coordinating initial rescue efforts and later talking to officials from across the country who offered equipment, food and medical supplies for the victims and their families. <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> learned that the city lacked some heavy equipment and communications gear, but said he was pleased that numerous private companies offered their assistance almost immediately. This past week, while <PERSON> Hurricane </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> moved through the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> toward the <LOCATION> Texas-Mexico </LOCATION> border area, <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> and other city officials prepared for the worst, although the storm ran inland to the south in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The store roof collapse had one effect on the city's preparations for the storm `` What the roof collapse did was give us confidence in our rescue procedures, that we could deal with a disaster as devastating as a hurricane,'' <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said. `` The roof collapse was more reactionary and with the hurricane we did have some lead time and we knew what we wanted to do.''

 Palestinians staged a general strike Saturday to mark the sixth anniversary of a <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> refugee camp massacre. Israeli soldiers shot and killed two Palestinians and wounded 27, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports and hospital officials said. The army clamped curfews on 250,000 Palestinians in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and arrested more than 100 alleged Arab ringleaders in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> in a nighttime raid aimed at heading off the disturbances. The 1.5 million Arabs of the occupied territories obeyed orders issued by underground leaders to stage a general strike marking the massacre of hundreds of Palestinians in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Sabra </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Chatilla </LOCATION> refugee camps by Israeli-backed Christian militiamen in 1982. In a related development, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> marked the 10th anniversary of the Camp David peace accords by again blaming `` Israeli intransigence'' for the U.S.-brokered plan's failure to give the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> a voice in ruling themselves. <PERSON> Butros </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghali </PERSON>, minister of state for foreign affairs, said in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>: `` <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> had hoped that this anniversary would come at a time when there was peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and Palestinians enjoyed the right of self determination. `` But because of Israeli intransigence, and the continuation of its occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> strip, and its continuation of repressive measures which stand against all international laws as well as <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> principles, the Palestinian people still live under tragic circumstances.'' The signing of the two accords, which laid down a framework that led seven months later to the only peace treaty between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and an Arab country, followed 13 days of negotiations at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential retreat at Camp David, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> considers that accord frozen since negotiations among <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> broke down in 1982. <PERSON> Ghali </PERSON>'s statement noted the uprising that began in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> last Dec. 8. He said the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> `` have refused and rebelled against -LRB- <LOCATION> Iraeli </LOCATION> occupation -RRB- in a huge popular uprising.'' Palestinians Saturday stayed away from their jobs and kept indoors except for knots of mostly young protesters who took to the streets to burn tires and stone Israeli forces. Late Friday, the army, bracing for trouble, arrested over 100 Palestinians suspected of organizing demonstrations in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dahariya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tulkarm </LOCATION> in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, a military spokesman said. But the move did not prevent the most widespread and intense violence in several weeks. In <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers opened fire after dozens of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> protesters blocked a main road with burning tires and stones and threw rocks at military vehicles, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters said. The troops killed 18-year-old <PERSON> Emad </PERSON> <PERSON> Arkawi </PERSON>, Palestinian hospital officials said. Arab reporters said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops also shot and killed 25-year-old <PERSON> Munjed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarhan </PERSON>, from the village of <LOCATION> Lubban </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sharqiya </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sarhan </PERSON> died immediately. His body was draped in a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flag and buried, the reporters said. A military spokesman confirmed a dead Palestinian was brought to <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION> hospital but said members of the family took the corpse for burial and the army could not investigate the cause of death. The spokesman said he was investigating the reported death in <PERSON> Lubban </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharqiya </PERSON>. Saturday's fatalities brought the Palestinian death toll to 268 since the intefadeh, Arabic for uprising, broke out nine months ago. Six Israelis also have died. Of the 27 Palestinian casualties reported Saturday, the army confirmed only the wounding of one boy in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION>, insurgents scrawled graffiti in Arabic and Hebrew that said `` Death to the Jews'' and `` The End is Near.'' It was the first time protesters have painted graffiti in <LOCATION> Hebrew </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Construction Site Turns To Fish Grab, And Grabbers Get Ticketed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A highway construction site turned into a fish grab when part of a bayou was drained, leaving a wide, muddy hole where men with nets, buckets and spears sloshed around after fish. But not for long: state wildlife and fisheries agents armed with ticket books quickly put the brakes on the landlubber fishermen Friday. `` The people who got citations were the ones in the water actively chasing the fish,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON> of the wildlife department. `` We did n't write up anyone who was picking up dead fish off the bank. If they want to scavenge, that's their business.'' Agents ticketed only people who caught gamefish such as bass or perch from the water, letting them keep trash fish such as catfish, gar and buffalo fish, he said. But men at the construction scene after the incident disputed <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON>, saying the game wardens confiscated all of the fish, including catfish and buffalo fish. And, they said, nobody was allowed to pick up any of the fish at the site. `` I do n't think it is right for us to have to pay a big fine for catching fish that were going to die anyway,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Alexandria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Talk </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified participant as saying. The minimum penalty for violating state gamefish regulations is $ 25. <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON> said the best thing for the contractor to have done with unharmed fish stranded in the pool have been to dump them into the bayou on the other side of the earthen dam. Project engineer <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Boniol </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> and Development said he was not present when the tickets were issued and is not familiar with state laws governing taking fish at a construciton site. `` That's not in the plans and specifications we drew up for this project,'' he joked.

 A high school English class took on a task of epic proportions when they decided to read aloud Homer's epic poems, `` Iliad'' and `` Odyssey.''

<HEAD>Creator Of Corvette Stingray Dies Of Heart Failure</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, creator of the now-classic <PERSON> Corvette </PERSON> <PERSON> Stingray </PERSON> and a former <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> executive, has died of heart failure at the age of 76. Ranked as one of the top 10 auto designers of all time by Car and Driver magazine, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> was a winter resident of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. He died Monday in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and was buried Friday in <LOCATION> Bloomfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. A vice president of design at <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> for 19 years, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> molded the appearance of hundreds of car models, including the 1963 <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Riviera </ORGANIZATION> and the 1970 Camaro. His designs were transformed into more than 72.5 million automobiles, according to <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>. The Stingray was introduced in 1963, when the Corvette was about 10 years old, and quickly became the dream of sports-car lovers. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> told The Post of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, last year of the genesis of his idea for a body design that became the fiberglass-body Stingray. `` I bought a Corvette chassis for one dollar,'' he said. `` I created the Stingray. I wanted it to look like no other car. I wanted to race.'' <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> officials had stipulated that <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> remove all company logos and keep the car off <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> property while he tinkered with it, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. He was quick to complain about today's cars. `` I do n't like the new Corvette,'' he told the newspaper. `` I think it's very bland. The emblem looks like a cigar wrapper. It has no classic look.'' And most new cars `` all look like a bar of soap ... they lack definition,'' he said. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> joined the <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> design staff in 1935, and a year later was promoted to chief designer for the <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studio </ORGANIZATION>. There he created the 1938 Cadillac Sixty Special, the first smaller, personal luxury car. He retired from <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> in 1965. Survivors include his wife <PERSON> Marian </PERSON>, three daughters and four grandsons.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> on Saturday blessed wheelchair-bound victims of <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s 13-year civil war and noted improvements in the Marxist government's relations with the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. On the last portion of a 10-day, five-nation tour of southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the pope flew from the capital, <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Beira </LOCATION>, an <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> city of 300,000 isolated except by air and water because of intense guerrilla activity in the region. <LOCATION> Beira </LOCATION>, the country's second-largest city after <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION>, has been plagued by almost daily cuts in electricity and water shortages caused by sabotage from anti-Marxist rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> Mozambique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> movement. Protected from a blazing sun by a thatched altar shaped like a native hut, the pope delivered a Mass at the edge of a golf course where the grass had been cut for the first time in 14 years, local officials said. Security surrounding the pope was tight. `` The picture frequently described by missionaries who live with you is not without shadows, due to the prevailing situation of insecurity, which ... generates violence, anxiety and distress, leaving limited space for freedom,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said. The civil war, which began after <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> gained independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1975, has forced about 1 million Mozambicans to flee to neighboring countries. Relief agencies estimate 6 million of <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s 14.5 million populace require food aid. At the open-air Mass before 50,000 people, the pope blessed a tractor driver who lost his legs when his vehicle hit a landmine and a young man whose legs were paralyzed after he was hit by bazooka fire in a rebel ambush. Port and rail links from <LOCATION> Beira </LOCATION> reach into landlocked African nations and have been a frequent target of attack by rebels, known by their Portuguese acronym <ORGANIZATION> Renamo </ORGANIZATION>. The Mozambican government has been openly hostile to churches in the past, but now is working to improve strained relations. The government recently returned church-run schools and hospitals that it said were mistakenly confiscated when many such institutions were nationalized. The rector of <LOCATION> Beira </LOCATION> seminary, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Machabo </PERSON>, said the government returned two churches in his area that were being used as a warehouse and a gymnasium. In an apparent reference to anti-church government policies, the pontiff said social ills develop when men begin `` shutting themselves off to God.'' But the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> acknowledged the improvements, saying, `` I would like to recognize also the efforts that are being made at this moment for the difficulties to be overcome.'' Life for <LOCATION> Beira </LOCATION>'s residents remains difficult. Communications are poor, stores lack many basic foods, transportation is difficult and residents almost never travel outside the city for fear of rebel attacks. `` But life is improving,'' says <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> do </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceu </PERSON>, a Portuguese nun who teaches languages at a local school. `` Five years ago a piece of meat was an event, now we have it from time to time.'' Later, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> spoke to about 5,000 people at the airport in the northern city of <LOCATION> Nampula </LOCATION>, where he heard more horror stories about the civil war. The Portuguese archbishop of <LOCATION> Nampula </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Vieira </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinto </PERSON>, said rebels killed 8,000 civilians and plundered about 600 towns in the past five years. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> also met with clergy in <LOCATION> Nampula </LOCATION> before flying back to <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION>, where he was scheduled to speak Sunday. Some Mozambican bishops have urged the government to talk with the rebels. But President <PERSON> Joaquim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON>'s government has refused to negotiate and has criticized the bishops for advocating talk with `` armed bandits.'' The rebels have been accused of widespread civiian atrocities, a charge they deny. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, in an April report, estimated the rebels have killed 100,000 civilians in the last two to three years. The rebels earlier announced a cease-fire during the pope's visit and wished the pontiff a good stay <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> met the pope last May in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, but the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> appears to be holding off the establishment of diplomatic relations as an incentive to advancing the peace process. <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, ravaged by drought in recent years, receives most of its military assistance from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but increasingly has been making overtures to Western nations. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the largest donor of food aid in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has been providing military training.

<TEXT>
 The Sandinista government and U.S.-backed rebels plan to resume talks Monday after a three-month stalemate in their search for an end to seven years of war. Both sides called the planned two-day conference in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> a preliminary step toward reopening the high-level talks that broke off June 9. The left-wing <PERSON> Sandinistas </PERSON> and rebels, known as Contras, signed an accord March 23 to seek a negotiated settlement to the conflict the government says has claimed the lives of 28,000 Nicaraguans. The agreement called on the rebels to lay down their arms in exchange for democratic reforms. Shortly before the talks broke off in June, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> proposed a timetable for disarmament and political reforms. But the Contras rejected the plan, saying it did not go far enough. They insisted on the immediate release of political prisoners, disbanding of the <ORGANIZATION> supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> court </ORGANIZATION> and full democratic guarantees. A March 21 agreement to suspend offensive military operations remains in place but both sides accuse the other of violating the truce. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> issues frequent communiques claiming Contra ambushes of government forces. <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON>, spokesman for the rebels, said recently Sandinista troops attacked Contra positions 93 times in August. Earlier this month the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> proposed preliminary talks in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> to be followed by a conference in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. The Contras initially rejected the suggestion, saying the government had restricted their movements during four earlier talks in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> and they would not return to the capital. They also wanted <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s opposition parties to participate in the next round of talks. Last weekm the rebels added a new condition. They demanded the release of more than 40 opposition leaders arrested by police during a demonstration on July 10. <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> recently proposed Sept. 26 for the next high-level talks to be held in a still-to-be decided location. The Sandinistas maintain the talks should be held in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> and that only the government and the Contras take part. Overt <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the rebels ended Feb. 29 and the Contras have few bargaining chips left. Over the past four months, most of the rebel forces fled from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> back to base camps inside <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> where they receive non-lethal aid suplied by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Contra sources say only 2,000 fighters remain inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, with more than 9,000 in base camps near the border in eastern <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The rebels, saying the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> still get large amounts of Soviet-supplied war materiel, are seeking renewed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid. Both sides are anxiously awaiting the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential elections in November. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> hope for a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> victory by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who opposes more Contra aid, while the Republican contender, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, has supported aid to the rebels.

<TEXT>
 One of the worst growing seasons in recent memory will mean a smaller-than-usual apple crop in the nation's second-largest apple-producing state, growers said The effects of late spring rain showers just when pollination began and a dry summer is coming into focus even as the state's major apple variety, the <PERSON> McIntosh </PERSON>, is being harvested in orchards across <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> this weekend `` It's too early to tell any numbers, but this year's crop is definitely down,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>, a vice president of <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> <PERSON> Brother </PERSON>'s Orchards in <PERSON> Wolcott </PERSON>. Statewide, production this year is estimated to be about 2 million bushels down from last year's 18.8 million bushels, according to industry figures. It's also the smallest apple crop since 1972. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemka </PERSON>, a fruit grower in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Greenbush </LOCATION>, said he was just beginning his harvest, and his crop is looking farily good. But there is usually a 10-day period in which McIntosh apples can be picked, he said, and any extended period of rain would be yet another setback. According to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, a cold front was headed into the state and showers are likely. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, the nation's leading apple producer, growers have largely avoided the drought. A July forecast for the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> fall apple crop calls for total production about one-third less than the record 1987 crop, but that's largely because trees naturally bear less fruit the year after a big crop. The total would be about the same as the 1986 crop.

<TEXT>
 The 15-month-old coalition government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Thorsteinn </PERSON> <PERSON> Palsson </PERSON> resigned Saturday night after failing to agree on a program to deal with the country's acute economic problems. President <PERSON> Vigdis </PERSON> <PERSON> Finnbogadottir </PERSON> was expected to decide within a day whether to call new elections or to ask a leader of one of the three coalition parties to try to form a government. <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>'s fishing industry, which produces 70 percent of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> island nation's export income, has suffered heavy losses. The economic crisis became so severe that on May 14, two days before he was to have left for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Palsson </PERSON> postponed an official visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He subsequently made the trip on Aug. 9. Also, on May 14, the government temporarily suspended currency trading because of a drain on foreign reserves caused by speculation the currency, the crown, would be devalued by 20 percent.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, declaring Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has provided `` zero protection for the environment,'' proposed Saturday elevating the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to a Cabinet department. `` And the first secretary of the Environment is going to be as committed to protecting the environment as <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been to neglecting it,'' the Democratic presidential candidate told a cheering crowd of campaign workers. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> drew a roar of approval from several hundred volunteers when he referred to rhetorical flubs by the Republican ticket. `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> does n't know what century he's in and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ca n't remember the Pledge of Allegiance,'' he said. From <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, to share the spotlight at the annual <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> dinner with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and to plead for high turnout among black voters, acknowledging blacks will be essential to a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> victory. `` Our adversaries are not just <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in prepared remarks. `` Our adversaries are despair and resignation and indifference and complacency.'' He struck several themes important to blacks, including civil rights, law enforcement, increasing the minimum wage, support for <PERSON> black </PERSON> colleges and sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s repressive apartheid regime. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> laid out his plan for a new Cabinet department at a rally in a union hall at which his campaign was signing up precinct workers for the drive to capture <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s 47 electoral votes _ the biggest single prize on Election Day. With politicians and pollsters agreed that the fight for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s critical electoral votes was currently a dead heat, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was recruiting thousands of precinct workers to his cause. At a series of meetings across the state, similar to the one at which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spoke, the campaign hoped to sign up 5,000 precinct captains. The process will be repeated on upcoming weekends in an effort to have a worker in each of the state's 23,000 precincts. The environment is a major issue in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and one of the most volatile aspects is the controversy over offshore oil drilling. Following <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' announcement, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hair </PERSON> called it `` exactly the kind of presidential leadership needed to address some of the most complex and important human and environmental health issues before our society.'' While the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has advocated pushing ahead with drilling off the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said last spring that he favored a delay in approving pending leases to determine if they were environmentally sound. `` He's done more somersaults than an Olympic gymnast on the subject of offshore drilling off the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` When he's in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ he's for it. When he's in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, he says _ well, maybe not. `` My friends, we need a president who wo n't change his position with the time zone.'' `` There'll be no drilling in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>,'' he pledged. `` And we're going to send the administration's five-year oil and gas leasing plan back to the drawing board.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ridiculed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s record on the environment, saying `` he calls for ` zero tolerance' against those who poison our water with toxic chemicals, but for seven and a half years, he's provided zero protection for the environment of this country.'' He said that as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> task force on regulatory reform <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` diluted, delayed and destroyed scores of regulations to preserve the environment.'' In a fact sheet distributed by the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> staff, it was noted that the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> budget already is larger than those for the State and <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> departments and that it employs more people than the departments of Housing and Urban Development and Education. The cost was described as `` insignificant,'' perhaps as little as a few hundred thousand dollars. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spoke in front of banner that read, `` Orange County Volunteer Victory Team.'' The volunteers all received red, white and blue <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for president signs and were told to put them up in front of their homes and urge neighbors to do the same. `` Do n't let anybody tell you this campaign is just television,'' he told the volunteers. But the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> forces have an uphill fight in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, a Republican bastion. The best Democrats hope for in the area is to hold down the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> majority to a level they can overcome with votes from heavily Democratic areas of the state.

<HEAD>Iraq Claims It Resettled Kurds In Modern Villages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAMARNI, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has transformed the face of its northern Kurdish region with battles and bulldozers, and an official said Saturday that residents of hundreds of razed villages were moved to new, more modern towns. The government, which has accused of attacking Kurdish separatist rebels with chemical weapons, flew foreign reporters by helicopter to this devastated village and over much of the region Friday and Saturday. Guides ate grapes growing in one area allegedly attacked by chemical weapons to support the government's denial it used poison gas during its recent offensive against the Kurds. Rebel leaders claim 4,300 Kurds died in Iraqi gas attacks. Many other areas visible from the air have been bulldozed in what officials describe as a plan to concentrate Iraqis throughout the country in towns more easily served with power, water and other amenities. `` We are bringing together the families of the villages'' into new towns of 2,000 to 3,000 people, <PERSON> Namuk </PERSON> <PERSON> Raqib </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorji </PERSON>, the provincial governor, told reporters in <LOCATION> Dihok </LOCATION>, 210 miles south of the Turkish border and 250 miles north of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. `` The villages are isolated and far-flung,'' he said. `` It is very difficult to bring services to people.'' <PERSON> Dihok </PERSON> is one of three governorates in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s Kurdish region, where about 3.5 million Kurds live. `` About 200 small villages in <LOCATION> Dihok </LOCATION> alone'' have been eliminated, the provincial governor, <PERSON> Sorji </PERSON> told reporters. <LOCATION> Bamarni </LOCATION>, 12 miles south of the Turkish border, fell victim to the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> army's massive thrust against Kurdish rebels, who had been supported by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The offensive began shortly after a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire in the eight-year-old Iran-Iraq war went into effect on Aug. 20. A bulldozer stood on a hill overlooking the smashed concrete and mud-brick houses. Grape vines still flourished near broken bicycle frames, old shoes and an abandoned baby doll. Fire had scorched the orchard on the town's edge. There were no residents. Iraqi government escorts took reporters to what they identified as the <LOCATION> Balisian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, 95 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Bamarni </LOCATION>. They said it is where the rebels claimed gas attacks occurred, but there was no obvious evidence of that _ and no people either The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and several other western European states have urged the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to dispatch a team to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to investigate charges of poison gas attacks but <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> has refused. On a 90-mile flight from <LOCATION> Sulaymaniyah </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Arbil </LOCATION>, geometric grids of new concrete dwellings rose along highways or on the outskirts of large towns. Western diplomats say <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> appeared to be trying to end decades of simmering rebellion among Kurds by eliminating remote village sanctuaries and putting the general population into more easily controlled centers. But the Dihok governor said the program was `` a general decision'' applied across the country, although outside observers have not noted movements on a similar scale outside the Kurdish region. Tens of thousands of Kurds from villages have fled into <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> during the latest fighting. In another development <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s information minister, <PERSON> Latif </PERSON> <PERSON> Nassayif </PERSON> <PERSON> Jassim </PERSON>, said Saturday <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would `` pay very dearly'' if it attacked targets on the pretext they were chemical weapons plants, the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. In June 1981, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> carried out what it called a pre-emptive air strike against the French-built reactor west of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> to prevent <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> from developing an atomic bomb.

<HEAD>Protesters Mass at Controversial Soviet Nuclear Power Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of people formed a human chain at a nuclear power plant in the Baltic republic of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> on Saturday to protest the facility's threat to the environment, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. The official news agency said people from all over <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> locked arms at the <ORGANIZATION> Ignalina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> in the north east of the republic. Fire broke out Sept. 5 in a control cable of the No. 2 reactor, but no radiation was released, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported at the time. During Saturday's demonstration, people cleaned up the area around the plant located near a lake and planted trees, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Some of the protesters were invited to tour the plant. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> did not give a precise number of demonstrators, saying only that there were thousands, or give their demands. The demonstration was part of a growing environmental campaign in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Soviets are increasingly taking advantage of <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, or openness, to speak out. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> himself has said the government should pay more attention to preserving the environment and earlier this year created an agency to oversee environmental protection. Concern over the dangers of nuclear power heightened in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and worldwide after the April 26, 1986, explosion at the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear power plant in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>. The accident sent a cloud of radioactivity worldwide and killed 31 people. Eight <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators and 20 congressmen sent letters Thursday to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> urging him to discuss the <LOCATION> Ignalina </LOCATION> plant's problems with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnandze </PERSON>, a U.S.-based group of Lithuanian emigres reported.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ridiculed Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s claim to be an environmentalist, accusing the vice president Saturday of flip-flops on the issue of offshore oil drilling and comparing him to former <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, speaking to campaign workers in <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, also said he would elevate the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to a Cabinet-level department. `` The first secretary of the environment is going to be as committed to protecting the environment as <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been to neglecting it,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was attacking <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on one of the issues the Republican presidential nominee has staked out for himself, having declared last month at an appearance in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> that he was a lifelong environmentalist. `` The next thing you know, we'll be hearing that <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorsuch </PERSON> -LRB- <LOCATION> Burford </LOCATION> -RRB- and <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavelle </PERSON> are environmentalists too,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Watt </PERSON>, who served as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first interior secretary, was a favorite target for attack by environmental groups because of his support for opening up previously protected land for commercial use. Mrs. <PERSON> Burford </PERSON> was in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> until 1983. Ms. <PERSON> Lavelle </PERSON>, who headed the agency's toxic waste cleanup program, served three months in jail for lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` The sight of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaigning on the coast and talking about his commitment to clean water reminds me of the old saying from television detective shows: They always return to the scene of the crime,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, on Saturday was wooing the immigrant vote often sought by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who seldom fails to mention his Greek-born parents. The vice president spoke briefly to a group of 174 new citizens from 62 countries at a naturalization ceremony in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stood in for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at the event, staged by the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on the Bicentennial of the Constitution to commemorate the 201st anniversary of the signing of the Constitution in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` We Americans have always thought of ourselves as special, as a light shining out to the world,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the new citizens after they were given the oath of citizenship by former <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> chief justice <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burger </PERSON>. `` All of us, from the newest citizen to the oldest, must participate in the running of this country.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s remarks were low-key and non-partisan, but the event gave him a chance to appear before television cameras flanked by the flag and a replica of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> and to recite the Pledge of Allegiance, which has become a mainstay of his campaign. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, speaking later to a crowd at the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> legislative conference in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the election's stakes are particularly high for blacks `` This election is a struggle for the future of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said in prepared remarks. `` It's a struggle for the soul of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. It's a struggle we must win, and I need your help to do it.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' unity message was designed to help heal what some regard as continued divisions within the Democratic party since he defeated <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for the party's nomination. `` Together, we're going to build an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> where we aim high again,'' he said, mentioning the issues of civil rights enforcement, judicial appointments, full employment, the war against drugs and sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s racist government. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of standing by and doing nothing while the administration tried to dismantle the Superfund program for cleaning up toxic wastes. He also said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supported <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of the Clean Water Act and has `` done more somersaults than an Olympic gymnast'' on the question of offshore drilling. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also came under attack Saturday for his role in leading the administration's efforts to stem the flow of illegal drugs into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He has said that he would appoint his vice presidential running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, to a similar responsibility if the Republican ticket wins the election. Speaking to a partisan crowd in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> panhandle, <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` wants to pass the torch of failure on to the junior senator from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, meanwhile, addressed a crowd of picnickers who gathered in the pouring rain at the farm of Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., near <LOCATION> Middleburg </LOCATION> `` I call this kind of weather <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> weather _ gloomy skies and dark clouds,'' said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, speaking into a microphone poking out of two bales of hay set up in front of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s house. But the strongest attack came from Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, who delivered the Democrats' response to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s weekly radio address with pointed references to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s decision to serve public information officer in the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> during the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> questioned <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s fitness to lead the nation's war on drugs. `` How can he be put in charge of this war when he would n't fight in the last one? We still have n't forgotten the last time he was given the opportunity to carry a rifle for his country,'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said. `` This is a fellow who sat out the last war typing press releases in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>.''

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rebel attacks are preventing convoys of relief supplies from reaching the famine-stricken south, a provincial governor was quoted Saturday as saying. The <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is `` obstructing relief operations to southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and that has stopped the works of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> there,'' <PERSON> Mauris </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawya </PERSON>, governor of <LOCATION> Equatoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>, said in a statement to the Sudanese daily <ORGANIZATION> Al-Nahar </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lawya </PERSON> said rebel attacks during the past few days forced an army-escorted convoy of 912 trucks headed for the provincial capital <LOCATION> Juba </LOCATION>, 750 Miles south of to return back to <PERSON> Yie </PERSON>, 70 miles to the northwest. <PERSON> Lawya </PERSON> said only 96 out of 1,080 supply trucks from neighboring <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION> were able to make the journey to <LOCATION> Juba </LOCATION>, 750 miles south of the capital <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, because of such attacks. The rebels believe the government might use relief convoys as a cover to move military reinforcements into areas under guerrilla control. Meanwhile, the rebel group claimed in a radio broadcast monitored Saturday that it captured <PERSON> Katre </PERSON>, a garrison town 20 miles from the border with <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION> and warned aircraft not to fly over southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> without its permission. The broadcast, monitored in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>, also called on civilians to evacuate <LOCATION> Juba </LOCATION> and nine other southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> towns. <PERSON> Pacifico </PERSON> <PERSON> Lado </PERSON> <PERSON> Loleik </PERSON>, who represents <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> in the sovereign council, which acts as head of state, said earlier this week that rebel attacks are stopping food trucks from reaching <LOCATION> Malakal </LOCATION>, an <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> city 425 miles south of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>. Officials have said thousands of people in the south have died and tens of thousands more may also perish without food shipments. The rebels, mostly Christians and animists, are seeking more autonomy as well as economic and administrative reforms from the Moslem majority government in the north.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> said Saturday that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> could hold their first summit in three decades if lower-level talks succeed. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s highest-ranking government official also denied strongly that the Chinese leadership is divided over how to proceed with the nation's economic reforms, now riddled with inflation, overspending and corruption. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> spoke in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> board of directors and executives. It was <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most positive response yet to Soviet calls for an improvement in ties. On Friday, Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> called for `` full normalization'' between the two Communist giants. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> have been politically at odds since an ideological falling out in 1960. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said he welcomed such a call. In a 40-minute interview at the <LOCATION> Diaoyutai </LOCATION> state guesthouse, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> stressed that Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, often regarded as <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s political rival, has been a full participant in recent decisions to slow down reforms. `` Rumors going around the world'' of a serious rift in the leadership are groundless, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said. Minor differences over policies are `` normal phenomena,'' he said. `` Our top leadership is united.'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` would like very much to normalize our relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' He noted that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> share 4,300 miles of common border, `` so the strain on relations between the two countries is not in the interest of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> because we need to modernize our country in a peaceful environment.'' He also emphasized that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has no intention of becoming an ally of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> or returning to the relationship of the 1950s, when <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> acted as a big brother to the fledgling Communist government in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The premier also refuted the idea that better Chinese-Soviet ties would be a threat to the West. `` Let me tell you a secret,'' he said with a smile. `` Recently when your <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary -LRB- <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> was here I asked him some questions about the Soviet military strength and he told me a lot of things I did not know.'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> also left open the possibility of the first Chinese-Soviet summit since <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> met <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> in 1959. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in his speech in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> Friday, renewed overtures for a summit he first made in <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION> in 1986. Although <PERSON> Li </PERSON> noted <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s longstanding `` three obstacles'' to a Chinese-Soviet summit, he seemed to play down the differences while emphasizing that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` would like very much to normalize relations.'' The three obstacles are the Soviet troop presence in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the nine-year occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by Soviet-allied <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, and the heavy Soviet troop presence on its border with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Progress recently has been made in all three areas. He said Chinese-Soviet talks on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> last month had `` reached certain results.'' He said some disagreements remain on other issues, but `` once there is further agreement the subject of a summit meeting will be placed on the agenda.'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> tried to dispel reports of dissension within <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s political ranks by explaining that all top decisions are made by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION>, which is headed by party chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> and includes <PERSON> Li </PERSON> He said decisions made in the past month to calm consumers and cool off the economy, including a ban on further price increases this year, were made `` under the directorship of General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> and some were proposed by him himself.'' Some Western and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> reports have speculated that <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, who advocates bold policies of introducing market-oriented reforms, is in trouble because of the current serious side-effects of the reforms. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said the reforms, initiated by senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> 10 years ago, will proceed, but there is a need to stabilize an economy battered by a 20-percent inflation rate, rising government deficits and uncontrolled spending on public projects. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> delegation was led by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> board chairman and chief executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> President and General Manager <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boccardi </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Judges Rule Public Interest Lawyers Can Collect Prevailing Rates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court said lawyers who handle so-called public interest cases at low rates can charge the government the higher `` prevailing market rate'' for their work if they win in a suit challenging federal policy. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, in an 8-3 decision Friday, ruled that public interest lawyers are entitled to collect fees at the often-higher, prevailing rate when they successfully challenge federal government policies. Under federal laws, the government must pay the legal fees of the winning side in a variety of challenges to federal statutes, a system designed to encourage private initiatives to enforce the law. The government, however, has challenged the size of the fees. Judges dissenting from the appellate decision asserted that the ruling overturns a rational and efficient method for determining fees, established by a ruling in 1984, and will `` create an enormous administrative burden for this court.'' A former assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney who was involved in establishing the rule that the government would reimburse lawyers at the rate normally charged by their law firms said the ruling would create chaos. `` How can you determine what the market price is?'' he asked, speaking on condition that he not be identified. `` Every law firm charges a different hourly fee.'' The case arose after four lawyers successfully sued the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, challenging laws that they said allowed huge mining companies to skirt environmental standards. The lawyers represented Save Our <ORGANIZATION> Cumberland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountains </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a citizens group based in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> district judge awarded them just under $ 200,000 in legal fees for the four-year legal battle, according to one of the lawyers. The government appealed. A three-judge appellate panel ruled that the two lawyers should be compensated at a lower rate of $ 100 an hour, finding that the district court judge had erred in using the prevailing market rate to determine the legal fees. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sentelle </PERSON>, in his opinion for the majority, said the three-judge panel's ruling was `` inconsistent with the intent of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in enacting fee award statutes'' and with <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings. From now on, he said, awards would be based on `` the prevailing market rate.''

<TEXT>
 A group of religious <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace activists arrived here Saturday after being expelled from <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, where they were held in a cell for four days after protests at the American embassy and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air base. Members of Project Independence, who arrived at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, said they were protesting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and that colleagues in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> would continue to protest. They said four other members of the interdenominational group, who chained themselves to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy gate in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Wednesday, have been joined by `` scores'' of Guatemalan citizens each day for prayers and protest songs. `` They will stay chained up until they are forcibly removed or until the seventh day of their action,'' said <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, 27, a seminary student at the <ORGANIZATION> Divinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He said the group in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> also will fast until the end of the protest. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> was one of 13 Project Independence activists detained in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> on Wednesday and deported Saturday for separate protests in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, the Honduran capital, and at the <LOCATION> Palmerola </LOCATION> air base 40 miles outside the city. The four protesters in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> were identified in a Project Independence news release as <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Liteky </PERSON>, 57, a former Roman Catholic priest; <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashera-Davis </PERSON>, 34, member of a religious community in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, Md.; former <ORGANIZATION> Swarthmore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> Dean <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuchardt </PERSON>, 49, and <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Story </PERSON>, 26, a legal researcher from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. According to <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> McCallum </PERSON>, 47, a doctoral student at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Divinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> who took part in the Guatemalan protests, Project Independence staged the demonstrations to coincide with the anniversary of the date in 1821 when <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> gained independence from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. `` We put our bodies in front of the path of death'' that project members regard as the fruit of Central American policies of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, Ms. <PERSON> McCallum </PERSON> said. The project was brought into being `` to condemn the long and continuing history of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military and CIA-backed intervention in all the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries,'' said a statement issued at an airport news conference. Ms. <PERSON> McCallum </PERSON> said the group was detained for three days in a cell measuring 6-by-14 feet, where two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consular officers visited them. Members of the group said Honduran guards told the protesters their case was being handled by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities. `` It was clear to us our destiny was in the hands of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy,'' Ms. <PERSON> McCallum </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Fryer </PERSON>, 31, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said the group received privileged treatment at the prison. Guards were friendly and food and newspapers were brought to the protesters. But he charged that Guatemalan prisoners down the corridor went without food for seven days and could be heard screaming under torture. `` It was horrible to know that this -LRB- alleged torture -RRB- was just one of the results of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government policy in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. The group identified the other members as: <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Helrich </PERSON>, 70, <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Teri </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, 30, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bach </PERSON>, 41, both of <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boylan </PERSON>, 45, <LOCATION> Wyandanch </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Laffin </PERSON>, 34, and <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Maas </PERSON>, 53, both of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Presby </PERSON>, 29, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, 67, <LOCATION> Philadephia </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON>, 32, <PERSON> Maloy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 49, <PERSON> Madison </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Beer Bash Brews In Bavarian Capital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of revelers jammed the downtown area Saturday to soak up the suds and kick off Oktoberfest, the world's biggest and best-known beer bash. Officials estimate more 6 million people will attend the 2-week-long binge of hoopla and are expected to consume nearly 1.4 million gallons of the brew. The annual event draws visitors from both home and abroad to savor the traditional Octoberfest fare _ hamhocks, sauerkraut, grilled chicken and sausages _ washed down with glasses of beer to the sound of blaring Bavarian folk music. The festival got its start as a wedding party when on Oct. 12, 1810, when Crown <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON>, who later became King <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> I of <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION>, married Princess <PERSON> Therese </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Saxony-Hilburgshausen </PERSON>. That five-day celebration was held on the same patch of ground where the event is held today. During the early Octoberfests, the royal family paid the costs of the festival, but that tradition has long since faded and visitors are paying record prices for their brew this year. According to festival organizers, a liter of beer will cost on average about $ 3.70. Organizers said they expected consumption to equal or top last year's figures. Last year, revelers drank 1,396,720 gallons of brew and consumed a total of 732,859 grilled chickens and 349,594 pork sausages. Since its inception, the annual event has only been canceled 24 times, in 1854 and 1873 because of cholera epidemics, and during and after World War I and World War II.

 `` He was so ugly he had to sneak up on breakfast,'' one tale-spinner said, as `` Once upon a time ...'' took on a down-home flavor out at the eighth annual Northern Appalachian Storytelling Festival. Storytelling often has been relegated to the children's hour at libraries, storytellers said at the weekend event at <ORGANIZATION> Mansfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in north-central <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. But now they said they are in demand for everything from therapy for emotionally disturbed children to corporate picnics. `` Folk arts never die out. It's like a river that flows underground,'' said <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, 51, of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Augustine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` Then it breaks back into the sunlight.'' `` Just tell what happened and it's history,'' said <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, one of four storytellers at the two-day festival. `` Storytelling is just like history gussied up a little bit.'' <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Preservation and Perpetuation of Storytelling in <LOCATION> Jonesborough </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, said the number of full-time professional storytellers has increased from about a dozen in 1973 to 200 or more. Attendance at the National Storytelling Festival, held each October since 1973 in <LOCATION> Jonesborough </LOCATION>, has grown from 60 to more than 5,000, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON>'s festival was expected to draw 500 people this weekend, up from 50 when it started. Storytelling lagged with the coming of radio and television but has reemerged as people have turned back to basics, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` There's something very special and very important and very powerful about a told story. ... It's a co-creational process. With television, everything we have is created for us. We literally see the smoking gun,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 41, a former high school English and journalism teacher. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> began his career in the 1960s performing as a back-up guitarist and later toured as a folk singer. `` Through the early and mid'70s, I kept expanding the introductions to my songs,'' he said. Now, his guitar playing provides interludes for colorful tales sprinkled with down-home wisdom. He told of massive high school teacher <PERSON> Eulalah </PERSON> <PERSON> Singleterry </PERSON>, `` who loomed above us like a myopic praying mantis,'' and a pit bull charging him that resembled `` a blimp swallowed in a mammoth raccoon coat.'' And he told of the movie projectionist `` so ugly he had to sneak up on breakfast.'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON> gave up teaching elementary school to tell stories full time in 1985. He strung together humorous anecdotes from his childhood in rural <LOCATION> McHenry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, where he grew up listening to stories from his father, a horse-trader, his grandfather, who ran the general store, and other family members. `` If you want to learn the family stories, you have to go to all the funerals,'' May said. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Norfolk </PERSON>, 37, was a park ranger in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> who had dabbled in stand-up comedy and acting before becoming a full-time storyteller two years ago. He told a folk tale from <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION> about a pot that produced food on command until the man who found it got greedy and ruined its magical powers. <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Peirce </PERSON>, 57, a native of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, began as a folk singer and has been storytelling since 1972. She told an Irish folk tale about a young man who apprentices as a thief, beginning her story with: `` Once upon a time when the birds ate lime and the monkeys chewed tobacco up a tree ...'' `` That's how my father started every story,'' she said.

 Taking a break from the headaches of the Palestinian uprising and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s election campaign, thousands of Israelis turned out Saturday for a canine beauty pageant. <PERSON> Marco </PERSON>, a feisty boxer owned by <PERSON> Dov </PERSON> <PERSON> Amir </PERSON>, padded off with the champion's trophy after beating out 800 other pretty pooches in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s dog-of-the-year contest held in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>'s Exhibition Center. `` We can find time for other things besides the intefadeh,'' said organizer <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshak </PERSON>, using the Arabic word for uprising to describe the 9-month-old wave of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> violence aimed at ending <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>.

Israeli couples in cutoff jeans and short-sleeved shirts pushed baby strollers from ring to ring to view the more than 50 different breeds ranging from tiny lap dogs like the <LOCATION> Yorkshire </LOCATION> terriers to <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Danes </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernards </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marshak </PERSON> said the contest was sanctioned by the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, and had judges from the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. But although the competition was billed as an international event, organizers conceded there were few if any contestants from abroad. This was in contrast to 1987, before the uprising began, when a World Dog Show competition attracted scores of foreign competitors to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` Even so, we do n't feel the intefadeh here,'' said <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahaf </PERSON>, a veterinarian, who was interviewed in the show ring where <PERSON> Conan </PERSON>, his steel gray <PERSON> Mastino </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoletano </PERSON>, had just taken a blue ribbon. The show briefly pushed the Nov. 1 general elections out of the limelight for the doglovers. Experts say the razor-tight race between the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> could determine the future of the Israeli-occupied Palestinian lands.

 A police officer was reassigned after videotapes showed him thrusting his baton into a crowd demonstrating outside a hotel where Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was holding a fund-raiser, the mayor said Saturday. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worker </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Huerta </PERSON>, who was distributing information about a table grape boycott, was injured during the demonstration Wednesday. Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> said <PERSON> Huerta </PERSON> was cleary visible in the group seen on the videotape. <PERSON> Huerta </PERSON> suffered two broken ribs and a ruptured spleen. Police said there were about 100 officers and 850 protesters at the demonstration outside the hotel where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was holding a $ 1,000-a-plate fund-raiser. Earlier that day, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had announced his opposition to the union's table grape boycott. <PERSON> Huerta </PERSON>, 58, a union vice president, co-founded the union in 1964 with her brother-in-law <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> said he, Police Chief <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> and other top police officials reviewed videotapes of the protest provided by television station <ORGANIZATION> KRON </ORGANIZATION> before deciding to reassign officer <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Achim </PERSON> to administrative duty, pending the outcome of several investigations into the incident. The mayor said that he has asked the police department to review its policies for use of batons in crowd-control situations. `` Police face a difficult task when outnumbered by large numbers of demonstrators and I want to be sure they use the most prudent methods _ methods that minimize the risk of injury to themselves or anyone else,'' <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> UFW </ORGANIZATION> supporter for 20 years, has visited <PERSON> Huerta </PERSON> at the hospital at least twice. He said she has not been interviewed about the incident yet, on the request of her doctor. According to <PERSON> Huerta </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON>, an officer took a <ORGANIZATION> UFW </ORGANIZATION> flag she was carrying, threw it to ground and stomped on it. He also said the same officer poked her several times above her left hip. In <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Saturday, actor <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON> led 350 supporters of the union's `` Boycott Grapes'' campaign on a traffic-stopping march down <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION>. The march was dedicated to <PERSON> Huerta </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> staged a 36-day fast that ended Aug. 21 to protest pesticide use on grapes. Union officials charge that excess use of the chemicals has caused cancer in farm worker families, a charge that government and industry officials strongly deny.

 Palestinian and Jordanian officials met Saturday to discuss aid from Arab countries to help Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s news media reported. The joint Jordanian-Palestinian Committee on the Steadfastness of Palestinians Living in Israeli-Occupied Territories `` reviewed its financial situation and ways of contacting some Arab countries for funds needed so that the committee can continue its activities,'' the official news agency said. A Foreign Ministry official said the committee wants to raise $ 450 million to finance economic and social projects in the territories. The official, speaking with the condition he not be identified, said the committee would contact Arab countries that have not paid promised commitments to the fund. <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, member of the executive committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> organization, headed the Palestinian side at the meeting and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Taher </PERSON> <PERSON> Masri </PERSON> led the Jordanian side. King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> formed the joint committee in 1980 to channel economic and other aid to 1.5 Palestinians living under Israeli occupation. It became the only formal link between <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s decision in July to his government from <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> affairs in the occupied territories. A 9-month-old uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation in the territories has left 268 Palestinians and six Israelis dead. According to resolutions of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> summit in 1980, oil-rich Arab countries agreed to contribute $ 100 million to help finance development projects in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, captured by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 Middle East War.

 The <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> schools superintendent said he enrolled his daughter in a public school outside the city to protect her from possible gang violence. <PERSON> Laval </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said his 16-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON>, witnessed seven youths putting a homemade bomb in a locker at her school last April. Although there had been no threats to his daughter, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said he and his wife are concerned about possible retaliation because she had helped law enforcement officials investigate the incident at the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in the city's impoverished and drug-ridden <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION> section.

 About 200 people were feared drowned Saturday after a river swollen by Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s heavy rains surged over its banks, sweeping away four buses and flooding scores of homes, authorities said. The raging <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Catarina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> engulfed cars, crushed houses and flooded large areas of this industrial city of 3 million about 110 miles from the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> border. Much of <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> was without power and drinking water and the airport was closed. Gov. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Trevino </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> declared the state of <LOCATION> Nuevo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leon </LOCATION> a disaster area. `` It was a terrible thing, the worst thing that could have happened here,'' said his spokesman, <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. `` This disaster is unprecedented in the state.'' The hurricane, the strongest on record, was downgraded to a tropical depression Saturday after leaving at least 100 other people dead across the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said there were at least 200 people aboard the four buses. `` I do n't think many of them could have escaped,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Adelberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Salas </PERSON> said only 13 people aboard the buses were saved. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said some 20,000 people in the state were homeless, 12,000 of them in <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>. `` We all left with only the clothes on our backs,'' <PERSON> Victorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> said as he picked through mud, gravel and the cement blocks where his two-room house had stood. Flood waters began to recede late Saturday but the current in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Catarina </LOCATION> was too strong for a search for bodies. <PERSON> Trevino </PERSON> told a news conference the bodies `` are buried in mud. If there are people inside -LRB- the buses -RRB-, they are dead.'' He said a total of 60 bodies had been recovered in <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> and downstream Saturday but a `` considerable number'' of people were still missing. `` The current carried more bodies but we do n't how many there are,'' said <PERSON> Coroner </PERSON> <PERSON> Juventio </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON> in the suburban township of <LOCATION> Guadalupe </LOCATION>. Four policemen were swept to their deaths trying to rescue the bus passengers, said <PERSON> Comandante </PERSON> <PERSON> Antulio </PERSON> <PERSON> Alejo </PERSON>, commander of the Cobra police unit. The National Civil Defense System in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said two volunteers helping the police officers were missing. <PERSON> Alejo </PERSON> also said that at the same spot `` There are several cars buried there also and we understand that some bodies are still in some of the cars.'' Weather stations reported that <PERSON> Hurricane </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, during a 28-hour period beginning Friday and ending Saturday morning, poured 12 inches of rain on <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>. As the water began to subside Saturday afternoon the wheels and chassis of one overturned bus could be seen. The vehicle was buried up to the wheels by mud and rocks. Nearby and partially buried were construction machines and other vehicles that had been carried by the raging waters into the river. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pichardo </PERSON>, an employee of <ORGANIZATION> Transportes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Frontera </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>, said about 64 people were aboard the two buses from his company. He said one bus was en route to <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> from the border city of <LOCATION> Nuevo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION> and the other was on a run from <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Police said the buses were coming from the direction of <LOCATION> Saltillo </LOCATION>, about 55 miles west of <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Saltillo </LOCATION>, a city of about 450,000, is the capital of neighboring <LOCATION> Coahuila </LOCATION> state. Police said the buses probably had been diverted from their original routes because of flooded roads. They said rising water stranded the buses on a low-lying stretch of road parallel to the river. As a special police unit, the Cobras, tried to rescue the passengers, the current increased, the water rose and the buses overturned. Downstream from <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>, bodies were being recovered from the river, police said. The bodies of an elderly woman, a small boy and two men, all unidentified, were found in the town of <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION> 14 miles east of <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>, said federal police spokesman <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Banda </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Cadereyta </LOCATION>, 20 miles east of <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>, a police spokesman said another `` eight or ten bodies have been pulled out of the river.'' At noon EDT Saturday, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> issued its final advisory on <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>. It said the center of the storm was near latitude 25.5 north and longitude 101.0 west or about 220 miles west southwest of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and 45 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>. Maximum sustained winds were estimated to be near 35 mph and the storm was expected to weaken further. But rainfall of 10 to 15 inches was forecast, with up to 20 inches in some areas. It was the second time in three days that <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> slammed into <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The storm hit the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> on Wednesday and killed at least 29 people after leaving 69 people dead in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, which turned into a hurricane Sept. 10, killed 26 in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, 30 in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, five in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and eight in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The storm at one point packed sustained winds of 175 mph and had gusts of more than 200 mph. It was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure, which was measured at 26.13, breaking the 26.35 inches recorded for the 1935 hurricane that devastated the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION>. The storm left 500,000 homeless and caused $ 8 billion in damage in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, the military government declared a state of emergency in three southern regions, where 50 to 60 percent of the agricultural production was destroyed. The storm left the eastern <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> resort of <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION> in shambles. About 300,000 people were homeless in <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> state and 10,000 more homeless in <LOCATION> Campeche </LOCATION>, on the west coast of the peninsula, said <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> news agency. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> stranded 8,000 tourists in <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cozumel </LOCATION>, left much of the peninsula without power or communications and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage. The storm came ashore again Friday afternoon along a sparsely populated stretch of the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> coast south of <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>. It quickly began to dissipate into torrential rains and high winds that drenched the northeastern states of <LOCATION> Tamaulipas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nuevo </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Coahuila </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, heavy rains fell on <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, with gusts up to 82 mph recorded at nearby <LOCATION> Padre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, but the vulnerable coastal area escaped the worst of the storm. A woman was killed Saturday morning when a tornado hit her mobile home in <LOCATION> Bexar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. A second person died in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> when a utility pole crashed into a house.

 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said Friday she hoped the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could resolve their differences and end a deadlock over compensation and other issues in negotiations over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases. `` Well, they have their position, and we have ours,'' she said of the disagreement. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> made her remarks before Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> offered to give up the Soviet base at <LOCATION> Cam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> closes its six installations in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. She told reporters Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> was trying to narrow differences in his talks with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, `` so I'm hoping they will.'' The Filipino-U.S. talks are to set compensation and other terms for the final two years of the bases agreement, which expires in 1991. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> refuses to say if she will support extending the agreement. On Thursday, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants to keep the giant <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Subic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and other installations but Filipino money demands were too high. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is considering moving the bases to Guam or other sites. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> now pays about $ 180 million a year to use the bases. <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> sources have said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> offered to increase the compensation to nearly $ 500 million, including doubling direct bases-related aid to $ 360 million. <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> newspapers say the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> has demanded up to $ 1.2 billion a year, although <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> refuses to confirm that figure. Many Filipinos see the bases as an odious vestige of American rule here, which ended with Philippine independence in 1946. In addition, <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> and other officials maintain the bases do not serve Philippine interests because the country does not perceive an external threat. Last week, Deputy Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingles </PERSON> told a meeting of non-aligned nations in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, that the bases may threaten national security by making the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> a target in a future superpower confrontation.

<TEXT>
 A report on a June train crash that killed 57 people said a radio alert from the train hurtling out of control 90 seconds before impact was not relayed over loudspeakers at the station until 30 seconds before it hit. An investigating commission's findings, made public Friday, said the accident at the <LOCATION> Gare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION> station was due to a `` chain of circumstances'' implicating both personnel and the complex rules of the state-run train authority. The 36-page report recommended better training for personnel, modification of some equipment and an improved radio network. It stressed the `` unfavorable circumstances'' caused by a passenger who pulled an alarm to automatically stop the suburban train shortly before it was to enter <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> at rush hour June 27. The train restarted, then hurled without breaks into the station, crashing into a standing train about to depart. The report said that from the moment the conductor tried rearming the breaks after the unscheduled stop, a series of technical and human errors took place. The report noted that a radio alert was given just 1 -LCB- minutes before the accident while loudspeakers warned of the impending crash just 30 seconds in advance, leaving passengers on the standing train little time to evacuate. Most of the dead were in the standing train. Transport Minister <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Delebarre </PERSON> said the report had been handed over to the head of the train authority, <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Fournier </PERSON>, for study before a board meeting scheduled for Oct. 26.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has advised the Canadian and Illinois-based makers of railroad maintenance equipment that it will file a lawsuit to block their proposed joint manufacturing venture, a department official said Friday. The $ 30 million project proposed by <ORGANIZATION> Ivaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jordan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Schaumburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, would violate federal antitrust laws, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rule </PERSON>, the assistant attorney general in charge of the department's antitrust division. In a statement issued late Friday, <PERSON> Rule </PERSON> said the venture might lessen competition in the production and sale of automatic tampers, large pieces of equipment used to level and allign railroad tracks. `` The proposed joint venture would control over 70 percent of the automatic tampers sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` We are particularly concerned ... because it would reduce to only two the number of <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sellers of automatic tampers. As a result, railroad companies would face higher prices.'' Sales of the tampers totalled about $ 15 million last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Ivaco </ORGANIZATION> is the largest domestic producer of the equipment, made by its <ORGANIZATION> Canron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary at plants in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Queensland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, the department said.

<HEAD>EPA Must Decide If It Will Regulate All Benzene Emissions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> must decide by March 13 whether to regulate benzene emissions from at least nine additional sources, according to a federal judge's ruling The ruling by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> declined, however, to impose a deadline sought by an environmental group for tightening controls on evaporation of gasoline, one source of benzene, from cars. Benzene is a major chemical building block for producing other chemicals. Breathing benzene causes leukemia, according to studies of industrial workers. Though EPA has made decisions about several sources of benzene, and is considering major regulations for some of them, the judge said the Clean Air Act requires the agency to make explicit decisions on benzene emissions from other sources the agency has identified _ plants making ethylene, chlorobenzene, nitrobenzene, linear alkyl benzene and cyclohexane; chemical and refinery waste disposal; industrial solvent usage and the bulk handling and transportation of gasoline. If the agency decides these sources deserve regulation, it must adopt regulations within six months, the judge said in the ruling issued Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> expects to adopt a tightening of auto gasoline evaporation regulations by the end of the year. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Doniger </PERSON>, attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the plaintiff in the case, said Friday the ruling applied to all hazardous air pollutants over which <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has jurisdiction. `` EPA ca n't just pick one source, regulate it and say, ` That's it,''' <PERSON> Doniger </PERSON> said The sources in question were identified in the 1970s `` but just dropped off the agency's scopes,'' he said. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckart </PERSON>, associate general counsel of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` We have a lot of doubt whether she had jurisdiction to issue the order,'' and for the plaintiff, `` the proper way would have been a petition to use to regulate those sources.'' However, he said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has not decided whether to appeal.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is reviewing 40 break-ins at offices and residences of political opponents of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> policies, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. The department, Sessions told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, is trying to determine whether there were violations of civil rights in the break-ins, which in most cases are unsolved. Government lawyers are reviewing the incidents on the basis that the unidentified people committing the crimes may have conspired to inhibit the victims from carrying out their constitutional rights to petition <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> already has said it has found nothing to suggest the burglaries are connected to each other and has ascertained no pattern to them. A member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights, Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON>, D-Wis., theorized that the break-ins possibly could be politically motivated and are being carried out by Salvadorans in this country or by intelligence assets of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee chairman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif., suggested the <ORGANIZATION> Salvadoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, which critics of the Salvadoran government say is linked to right-wing death squads in that country, also might be in contact with those conducting the break-ins Sessions told the panel that <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>' theories may be correct, but that the bureau has nothing to substantiate them. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration critics have suggested the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> might be involved in the break-ins, but bureau officials have said they have found no evidence of that. Sessions said it is `` important for the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public to know that it is not the bureau'' involved in the burglaries and he said he looks forward to `` being able to respond'' to inquiries by <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> that the bureau had nothing to do with them `` and I hope that it is always that way.'' At one of the locations under review in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> examination, the <ORGANIZATION> Old </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, has been burglarized 10 times since 1984.

He wants the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to conduct more widely focused probes of the burglaries, on the basis that they interfere with First Amendment rights, not just on the narrow question of whether the groups lobby <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>' list of break-ins in a May 4 letter totaled more than 70. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> says there now are some 100 break-ins that appear to fit the pattern of being targeted at Central American policy opponents.

<TEXT>
 Despite some criticism that his call for an evacuation of the island was unnecessary, City Manager <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> said Friday he made the decision because his primary interest was in saving lives. By Friday morning, about 65 percent of the 65,000 <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> residents were off the island with 40 percent of them leaving before the evacuation recommendation was given, <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> said his decision to call for evacuation was based in part on a report by the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> that the hurricane could hit near <LOCATION> Freeport </LOCATION> if it turned northward overnight. The report said if that happened, Friday morning would be too late to evacuate the entire island, which takes 17 hours. About 90 percent of the businesses were closed on the island Friday. Many homes and businesses were boarded up. `` It's like a ghost town around here,'' <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> said. As <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s center moved onto the northern Mexican shore Friday afternoon, however, forecasters lifted a hurricane watch for the upper <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> coast at 2 p.m. and <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> officials rescinded their evacuation recommendation. <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> said the data may have been misinterpreted by <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> officials and that evacuation may have been premature. But <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> said Friday he did not misinterpret the data and that it was just one piece of information used to decide whether to evacuate. Even if the hurricane misses the <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> area, the economic impact caused by lost tourist dollars and closed businesses could top $ 70 million, city manager <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> said Friday. At least 30 area school districts were closed Friday and athletic and cultural events were postponed because of the hurricane's threat. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> sent all but a few employees home Thursday and closed the center to tourists. In <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, traffic was lighter than usual Friday morning as area schools, colleges and some businesses decided not to open. But many other businesses decided against closing as the threat of <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> waned. <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which employs nearly 4,000 people in the area, remained open Friday as did <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> with its 13,000 <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> workers. <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said `` it was business as usual'' Friday despite the threat earlier this week the storm might hit the area. She said the company had no problems conducting business. `` We stayed open. Most of the downtown businesses did,'' Ms. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> banks also were open Friday. In hindsight, <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> said he would have made the same decision because he was more concerned about saving lives than anything else. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, officials may recommend an evacuation but they can not order people from their homes. Although the storm has forced many businesses to close and send employees home, it has meant big sales to some other companies. Panic-buying this week cleared the shelves of many grocery stores in the area and sales also were booming at lumber and hardware stores. But sales could slow later as people use up their hurricane provisions. And although oil prices increased earlier this week partly because of the storm, the decreasing chance that <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> would seriously disrupt energy production in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> helped curb the recent rally. Oil and gas companies operating in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> evacuated many of their personnel from refineries and oil platforms, but observers said the prospect of major disruption in oil supplies had waned.

 When the syndicated television show `` Entertainment Tonight'' planned a show on media hoaxers, they contacted veteran hoaxer <PERSON> Joey </PERSON> <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON> _ who quickly hoaxed them by sending a friend to do the interview. `` How could I resist?'' <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON> asked after the program aired Friday night. `` I mean, who did they think they were dealing with?'' <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON>, speaking by telephone from his <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> apartment, was ecstatic after viewing the opening segment on the show, which featured co-host <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> delivering this caveat: `` The hoaxers are honest enough to admit they enjoy the attention. But their bottom line is this: Let the talk show bookers, the newspaper assignment editors and the viewers beware.'' Laughed Skaggs: `` The only problem is they did n't take their own advice.'' `` <PERSON> Joey </PERSON> pulled a fast one on us,'' said ET producer <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Narblock </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, adding he suspected <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON> might have been up to something when a picture of the hoaxer in Penthouse magazine did n't match the fellow on the film. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> introduced the phony <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON>, played by writer-teacher <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, by detailing a hoax perpetrated on `` Good Morning America'' where <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON> offered a cure for the common cold: the common cockroach. Savage, wearing a pair of dark sunglasses, then says, `` What I hope to achieve is that the public becomes more skeptical. And if they're more skeptical, maybe they're more discerning, more demanding. And so the media, then, has to police themselves a little better.'' <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON> said he was doubly tickled because he had appeared previously on `` Entertainment Tonight,'' so the program should have footage of what he really looks like.

<TEXT>
 Major American motion picture exporters asked anew Friday for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government intervention to enable them to operate film distribution offices in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, in a formal unfair trade complaint to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative, accused <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> of violating a 1985 agreement permitting independent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> distribution of major <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> productions, of discrimination and of failure to crack down on pirating of video cassettes. Announcing the action, <ORGANIZATION> MPEAA </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON> told reporters the South Korean film importing and distributing industry has launched a `` very aggressive attack to make sure that Americans never get to open their own offices'' as promised in 1985. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> cinema houses bypassing local distributors to deal directly with the American exporters have been threatened with having `` live snakes let loose in their theaters'' to frighten away audiences, <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON> said, quoting Korean press reports. Two <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> cinemas that made direct bookings with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exporters to show `` Fatal Attraction'' and `` Batteries Not Included,'' pictures that were hits elsewhere in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, were expelled from their industry association and may be forced to cancel the openings later this month, <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON> said. It is a coincidence that the trade complaint is being filed at the start of the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Olympic Games, when <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is at the center of international attention, <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> MPEAA </ORGANIZATION> has been warning for weeks it would take action unless <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> authorities agreed to negotiate the issues and a recent meeting with the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> ambassador produced no results, he said. The South Korean Embassy did not respond immediately to requests for comment on the MPEAA complaints. The 1985 accord allowed MPEAA companies to import and distribute their motion pictures in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, he said. That accord prompted <ORGANIZATION> MPEAA </ORGANIZATION> to withdraw an earlier formal complaint it had filed with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative charging unfair trade. But three years later, the country's domestic film distribution industry, `` literally defying their government,'' has made it economically impossible for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exporters to operate distribution offices, <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON> said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is the only country outside the Soviet bloc where the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> film industry can not freely operate its own distribution system and split profits directly with cinemas. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s 673 cinemas showed 11 MPEAA pictures in 1984, 18 in 1985, 28 in 1986, 30 in 1987 and nine the first half of this year, he said. But independent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> film-makers not belonging to <ORGANIZATION> MPEAA </ORGANIZATION> operate in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> by selling films outright and 75 percent of the movie houses show American pictures, <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON> acknowledged.

 <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> rode her sailboard over the northern edge of Hurricane Gilbert on Friday to the cheers of a surfside crowd that gathered after word their city would be spared the brunt of the hurricane. Much of <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION> seemed abandoned Friday, but <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Drive </LOCATION> was jammed with traffic as residents and tourists flocked to the city's seawall with the news that <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> would hit farther south than expected. The eye of the hurricane came ashore Friday afternoon about 120 miles south of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, or about 280 miles from <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>. Scores of cars cruised up and down the windy beachfront road in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, as bicyclists, joggers and windsurfers were joined by crowds of residents complaining of cabin fever in their boarded-up homes. `` This is definitely the advanced class,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, a legal investigator who took her sailboard into 35-mph winds after fleeing Port Isabel near <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>. `` This definitely rates a ` 10'. But it's also a good day for conservative, positive sailing,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Corpus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christi </ORGANIZATION> architect <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, one of about a half-dozen surfers who rode high tides at 4 feet above normal levels. `` I was sitting in the house with the windows boarded up, getting kind of bored,'' said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. `` I decided I'd just get out here and see what the winds were like.'' Many of the residents and tourists who decided to stay in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION> had heard repeated warnings that <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> would likely turn toward the north, striking land near <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> and bashing <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION> with heavy wind and rain. But when the hurricane stayed on its course toward <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the seawall swelled with confident crowds. `` Most people probably would n't expect to see this many people down here in a hurricane, but once you've lived in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION> for a while, you come to expect the unusual out of the residents,'' said <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Roland </PERSON>, who was enjoying his daily bicycle ride along the seawall. Families gathered along the seawall as the waves lapped at the concrete steps, and children danced along the edge of the churning water, mugging for cameras. Many, including <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiter </PERSON>, said they just grew tired of sitting inside a house darkened by plywood-covered windows. `` I think everybody is just bored, and this is kind of a release from being cooped up,'' he said. `` You can only take that sort of thing so long before you start getting stir crazy.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> must stop using the name `` McSleep Inns'' for its economy hotels because the public would believe the hotels are owned by the fast-food giant <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a judge ruled Friday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Niemeyer </PERSON> said the use of the prefix `` Mc'' is a `` deliberate attempt to benefit by the good will and reputation of <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>.'' He granted McDonald's a permanent injuction and gave <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inns </ORGANIZATION> 30 days to comply with the injunction. The company immediately responded to the injunction by changing the name of their new hotel chain to `` Sleep Inns,'' which will offer a night's lodging for $ 20 to $ 29. The first two `` Sleep Inns'' will break ground next week in <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Salisbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, the company said. `` The last thing we wanted for our lodging product is to be confused with some hamburger chain,'' said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Petitt </PERSON>, executive vice president and chief operating officer for Quality Inns. `` We'll change the name to eliminate any chance of anyone being confused.'' Last September, Quality Inns, based in Silver Spring, announced the new chain of economy hotels to be marketed under the name `` McSleep Inns.'' Three days later McDonald's demanded that the name not be used. After repeated warnings from <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, Quality Inns filed suit against the hamburger chain, asking the court to declare that `` McSleep'' does not infringe on the chain's trademark. Quality Inns said the `` McSleep'' name was selected because it connotes a clear impression of value. McDonald's counter-sued Quality Inns in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, charging that the use of the name constitutes an infringement and that the public will confuse the hotels with <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Niemeyer </PERSON> heard the case without a jury in July. `` The court has reaffirmed the rights of our customers not to be confused or mislead by companies trying to profit from our name and image,'' <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubner </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said Friday.

<HEAD>Land Costs and Traffic Jams Change Face of Historic Center</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND DE LIGNY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The rising land costs and traffic jams of modern <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> are changing the face of the `` Canal Belt,'' the city's cultural and economic core since the middle of the 14th century. The industry that has operated there for centuries has moved to the suburbs, leaving behind a 35-percent employment rate in the area and bringing yuppy-like gentrification and skyrocketing rents to neighborhoods that had n't changed much since the 17th century. The latest and the last of the industries to depart was <PERSON> Klene </PERSON>'s candy factory, which had permeated its neighborhood with the distinct aroma of licorice since it opened in 1915 <PERSON> Klene </PERSON>'s factory moved to a modern, $ 9.5-million plant in <LOCATION> Hoorn </LOCATION>, 20 miles north. `` We left for a number of reasons, but the catastrophic traffic situation here was the most important one,'' said <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilarius </PERSON>, <PERSON> Klene </PERSON>'s managing director. The company serves about 10 percent of the Dutch licorice market with yearly sales amounting to the guilder equivalent of $ 4 million. As <PERSON> Klene </PERSON>'s output more than tripled over the past decade, getting the ingredients _ mainly sugar and starch _ in and the licorice and peppermint out became an almost impossible task because of the Canal Belt's old narrow streets, <PERSON> Hilarius </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` The daily average was five 20-ton trucks with raw materials and the finished product a day,'' said <PERSON> Hilarius </PERSON>. The trucks had to run an obstacle course of traffic jams on the 8-foot wide street along the <LOCATION> Looiersgracht </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. Industrial activity within <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>'s city center had been declining since the mid-1960s, when the city developed huge industrial zones in the deep-water port area west of the city. But development of the industrial zone was stunted by the 1973 oil crisis recession. Instead of industrial giants coming in, it was small to medium-sized businesses that took refuge from heavy traffic and high land leases in the city-owned industrial zones. City leases, which serve as a sort of real estate tax, have increased from the equivalent of $ 1.20 a square foot in 1978 to $ 4 now. An <ORGANIZATION> Amsterdam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> survey indicated that during the last eight months of 1986, more than 800 such firms moved out of the 2.3-square-mile Canal Belt, taking with them them some 2,200 jobs. Among the major departures was the <ORGANIZATION> Heineken </ORGANIZATION> brewery, which shifted its main brewery to <LOCATION> Zoeterwoude </LOCATION>, 25 miles south of the capital, and kept only its head office and a demonstration plant for tourist tours in the capital. `` It worries us greatly that 35 percent of the city center's work force is now unemployed,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Vilder </PERSON>, `` and most of the companies that left employed low-grade labor. <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>'s average unemployment rate is 18.4 percent, well above the national figure of 14 percent. <PERSON> Klene </PERSON>'s 85-member work force was made up of unskilled laborers. <PERSON> Hilarius </PERSON> said he unsuccessfully tried to buy city land for a new plant in the cramped city center. City Hall spokesman <PERSON> Harald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ytsma </PERSON> said, however, no municipal land had been sold since 1896, when the city adopted a lease-only policy to have tighter control over land use. Part of the area's unemployment problem stems from the traditional reluctance of Dutch workers to commute to jobs outside their own cities, with the majority of the commuting class white collar employees. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Vilder </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> minimizes the problem of industry abandoning the city center, saying other, smaller business are taking its place. `` The city is losing lots of unskilled jobs, but on the other hand, thousands of small businesses are opening their doors every year,'' he said. `` What is industrial activity? In our view, a small computer repair company also is industrial activity, and such firms abound in the inner city.'' That shift has prompted a gentrification that is turning historic working-class neighborhoods like the canal-woven <PERSON> Jordaan </PERSON> into upscale neighborhoods. With most city jobs now in the banking, commerce, media and tourism sectors, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Vilder </PERSON> says, unskilled workers should be induced to commute to out-of-town jobs. But blue collar attachment to inner city neighborhoods is often stronger than the draw of jobs in a strange city. One elderly <PERSON> Jordaan </PERSON> woman signalled that bittersweet attachment when she told a new white-collar neighbor, `` If it were n't for people like you, my son could afford to live in this neighborhood.''

 As the season approaches for yearend tax planning, investors face the possibility that some standard, time-tested strategies might not work so well this year. In normal circumstances, the main idea in yearend maneuvering for tax purposes is to minimize the tax liability from investments you would incur for the current year's tax return. To do that, you could use any one of several techniques for postponing realization of capital gains until the new year arrives. In addition, you might sell an investment that has performed poorly before yearend, taking a loss to offset profitable sales made earlier in the year or to reduce your other income by as much as $ 3,000. Advisers on tax matters have traditionally urged their clients to take these steps early, so as not to be caught in the late-November and December rush. But thanks to the elections, the federal budget deficit and the possibility of additional changes in the tax code before too long, many of the experts are hesitating to make the usual recommendations right now. As <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> put it in its advisory publication The Outlook: `` Keep in mind that shifting investment gains forward to 1989 could be the wrong move if tax rates rise next year, a possibility that certainly ca n't be ruled out. `` On the other hand, the next tax hike could come in a package that would lower capital gains tax rates.'' Adds <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, a Valley Forge, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, adviser on tax and investment planning, `` Ingrained in our subconscious is the notion we must delay income taxes as long as possible. `` 1988 may be the year to purge ourselves of this preconception _ the 28 percent tax rate wo n't last forever.'' The idea of postponing tax liabilities rests on a solid foundation known as the time value of money. The longer you can legally put off the time of reckoning, the longer you have the use of the money and its earning power. Many long-term investment strategies are geared to delaying taxes until after you retire, when you presumably fall into a lower tax bracket than you occupied in your peak earning years. The problem is, the virtues of tax postponement come into question when you do not know what future tax rates will be. No matter what is said during the presidential election campaign, many financial observers believe `` revenue-raising'' proposals will be made next year because of the need, mandated by law, to narrow the federal budget deficit. Nevertheless, some observers say, there is a case to be made for waiting longer than usual to decide on 1988 tax strategies _ if you think, or hope, that the rest of the campaign and the results of the Nov. 8 elections will help to clarify the tax outlook for next year and beyond. No matter what the future may hold, there is a natural human tendency to want to reduce the current year's tax burden, if only for the emotional satisfaction that comes with a refund in the spring. For investors planning to sell losing investments before yearend, experts offer the reminder that they must avoid what the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> calls a `` wash sale.'' If you sell an investment, and repurchase it within 30 days -LRB- either before or after -RRB- the date of the sale, the loss from the sale does not qualify for any deduction. In the unusual environment that prevails this year, tax advisers agree, one old precept still applies: While tax planning is important, short-term tax considerations should never become so paramount in your mind that you permit them to lead you astray from your long-term plans and goals.

 Living in this coastal town, <PERSON> Elwot </PERSON> <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> learned to pay careful attention to the weather, and on the afternoon of Sept. 21, 1938, his nose told him to expect an `` autumnal sou ` wester It soon became clear it was something much worse. Trees were already down when a two-car garage was lifted by the winds before his eyes. `` It went up whole, like a kite, and flew on over the tops of the trees and smashed in the road just like so much kindling wood,'' recalls <PERSON> Avery </PERSON>, now 89. Impelled beyond reason to see more, <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> left his wife and stepped outside. His hilltop home had become an island; neighboring houses were swamped in 5 feet of water. The wind nearly blew him off his feet. He crawled back on his hands and knees. The Great New England Hurricane of 1938, which had turned inland virtually without warning, was the worst natural disaster to hit the region. Its torrential rains, 30-foot waves and 186 mph winds pulverized granite seawalls, twisted railroad tracks like spaghetti and leveled whole forests. Moreover, the storm was aimed like a giant wrecking ball at the most densely populated part of the country, the so-called Gold Coast between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. It wiped out 4,500 homes and badly damaged 15,000 other buildings, smashed 26,000 cars, sank 6,000 boats and tore down nearly 20,000 miles of electric lines. The death toll was generally calculated at 580 killed, 100 missing. Nowhere was it heavier per capita than in <LOCATION> Westerly </LOCATION>, a town of barely 20,000 inhabitants today and fewer then. Within hours of the storm's passing, the old <ORGANIZATION> Westerly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> became a temporary morgue where bodies _ eventually more than 100 _ were brought for identification. <PERSON> Avery </PERSON>, as owner of a funeral home, was put in charge. Since all the telephone lines were down, he got a ham radio operator to order a truckload of caskets. Then he worked round the clock for three days _ `` living on tomato soup and whiskey'' _ to bury the dead. Among them was his own mother, whose beachside cottage had been smashed to pieces by huge waves. The last time anyone saw her alive, he says, she was standing in the surf holding the handle of a suitcase. The suitcase itself had been torn away by the wind. There were similar scenes of terror everywhere the hurricane struck, from <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. As the waves swept through downtown <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, people ran for higher ground. Some drowned in the streets. <PERSON> Claire </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, who was 9 years old, remembers the terror she felt when her father did not come home that night. `` It turned out he climbed a light pole and hung on until he was rescued,'' she says, still exuding relief 50 years later. Short circuits caused by flooding set off the worst fire that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, had seen since <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> and the British torched the city in 1781. The flames quickly consumed 30 buildings and threatened the entire business district. Firefighters, floundering in water above their waists, watched in frustration as the hurricane blew the spray from their hoses back into their faces. Only a shift in the wind saved the city. Across the region, the storm cut power, transportation and telephones, isolating whole communities. In <LOCATION> Somerville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, physicians delivered babies by candlelight. As the <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> rose 25 feet and spilled over its banks, 10,000 people were evacuated from low-lying areas of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. After the flooding came looting. Fall River, <LOCATION> Marlboro </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Northampton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, were under martial law. National Guardsmen with fixed bayonets patroled <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> and Westerly. But there were also many instances of heroism. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION>'s Bostonian express was trapped, with 600 aboard, by floodwaters at a trestle near <LOCATION> Stonington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>. Hulks of cottages and boats slammed against the cars Passengers screamed as the train swayed dangerously. The engineer ordered everyone into the first car and the tender of his locomotive. Wading into shoulder-deep water, he uncoupled the other cars, then climbed back aboard and opened the throttle, nudging aside a house that had been tossed onto the tracks and driving the locomotive inch-by-inch across the buckling trestle to safety. On open water, it was a rare boat that was able to ride out the storm. In <LOCATION> Somerset </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, a 600-foot oil tanker was tossed ashore. In <LOCATION> Warwick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, the wind picked up a 30-foot sloop like a toy and deposited it 40 feet above the ground in the branches of an elm, where it remained perched and little damaged. <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> was blown half-a-mile across <LOCATION> Narragansett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> clinging to a wooden door. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Haggerty </PERSON> of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> looked out the window of the small office building where she was working and realized it was floating in the <LOCATION> Seekonk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. She made her way to the roof as the building swept toward the <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>.

The hurricane's damage, in 1938 dollars, was estimated at $ 400 million _ the equivalent of several billion dollars today.

<TEXT>
 A little past 1 a.m. on Sept. 30, 1938, in the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> here, the leaders of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> signed the <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> Pact and told the world war had been averted. `` I believe it is peace in our time,'' trumpeted Prime Minister <PERSON> Neville </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. A year later World War II started. Instead of being `` appeased'' by the dismemberment of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, as the <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> Pact provided, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> invaded <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The pact was, in fact, one of the great stepping stones toward war. A half century later, world politics is still being shaped by the lessons learned, the lessons unlearned and the lessons forgotten from the <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> Pact. `` The sort of attitude _ ` Let's not have another <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>' _ has become a way of thinking about international politics, particularly on the more conservative side,'' said <PERSON> Reinhold </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON>, a West German political scientist and specialist on the <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> Pact. <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON> added that is at least partially reflected in the continuing mistrust between East and West. `` <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> has become a sort of ideological catchword because it stands for a policy of capitulation,'' <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON> said in an interview. The <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> talks were a last-ditch attempt, led by <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON>, to appease <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s militaristic craving for `` Lebensraum'' -LRB- living space -RRB- and avoid war. <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> was threatening to invade <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, which would have triggered an immediate European war because of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s commitment to protect the Czechs and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s alliance with the French `` The <ORGANIZATION> Munich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> was not only one of the most important steps leading to World War II, but it has also become a symbol of successful political blackmail,'' said <PERSON> Hermann </PERSON> <PERSON> Graml </PERSON>, a top West German historian. <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON>, Premier <PERSON> Edouard </PERSON> <PERSON> Daladier </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and his ally in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, dictator <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Mussolini </PERSON>, began the <ORGANIZATION> Munich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 29, 1938. Czechoslovak leaders were excluded as <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> demanded. The site of the talks, a long, three-story, barracks-like structure built just three years earlier, still stands and is a music school. But <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s private office, where the four leaders met, disappeared long ago in postwar renovations. Firsthand accounts of the four-power meeting describe the Nazi leader as extremely volatile and ready to wage war if he was n't given <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s German-speaking Sudetenland `` <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> was in a crude and rude and aggressive mood _ a very unattractive character,'' the British statesman <ORGANIZATION> Lord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION>, who accompanied <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> as his aide, said in a recent interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> at his estate in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Daladier </PERSON>, writing years after the meeting, said of the start of the discussions: `` <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> arose and delivered a diatribe against the Czechs. It was a real explosion. Spreading his arms or clenching his fists, he accused the Czechs of a frightful tyranny over the Sudeten Germans.'' Historians say <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> had used the argument of self-determination for <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s minority Germans as a propaganda device to justify his claims upon the bordering nation. `` What he really believed in was the right of supposedly racially superior Germans to dominate other people,'' <PERSON> Graml </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Munich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor, said during an interview at his office. At one point during the discussions, <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> objected to <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s stipulation that Czechs who would evacuate their nation's 11,000-square-mile Sudetenland, an area slightly larger than <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, could not even take their cattle <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s translator during the conference, wrote in later years that the Nazi leader responded impatiently: `` Our time is too valuable to be wasted on such trivialities.'' <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> dropped the matter. Faced with a hostile Nazi leader who appeared ready to throw all of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> into war if he did n't get what he wanted, the <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> Pact was signed. Leaders from all over the world welcomed the agreement and what looked like a last-minute escape from war. But <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> said the pact had shamed his country. `` You were given the choice between war and dishonor,'' <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> told <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> later. `` You chose dishonor and will have war.'' <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> was given the Sudetenland, but it quickly became obvious he had no intention of keeping his vow to be satisfied with just that. In March 1939, German troops overran the rest of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Six months later German troops marched into <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and soon the world's major powers, including <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, were embroiled in a war that did not end until <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s defeat in May 1945. Many modern-day historians, like <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON>, say <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> had no choice but to sign the <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> Pact, arguing that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> could not have withstood a major war at that time. `` The British could not afford to go to war in September 1938 because of the negative status of its air force, and they had hardly any expeditionary force at all,'' said <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Muenster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. But the <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> Pact has left a lot of bitter memories. Some French historians say the <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> accord may be one reason there has never been a strong French pacifist movement since World War II. `` Politically, mentally, pacifism was killed by <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Jean-Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Azema </PERSON>, a historian at <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>' Political Science Institute. The Czechoslovaks, the sacrificial victims of the <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> Pact, also have bitter recollections of the infamous accord. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> was rebuilt after World War II and Communist leaders were installed. This past February, <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s new <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, defended the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> takeover in 1948 as a guarantee that the nation's alliance with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had rid it of dependence `` on imperialist states, for which a tragic price was paid after <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>.'' But <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s invasion was replayed 30 years later with the Soviet-led invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> that crushed the 1968 `` Prague Spring'' reform movement.

 With loyalty unshaken by hindsight, <ORGANIZATION> Lord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Neville </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON>'s aide at the 1938 <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> Pact talks with <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>, defends an episode long ranked among the most shameful in British history. `` <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> decided to continue with this peaceful diplomacy in order to try to persuade <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> that war would be a tragedy not only for <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, but for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' Home -LRB- pronounced <PERSON> Hume </PERSON> -RRB- said in an interview as the 50th anniversary of the <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> Pact approached. `` He thought that <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> must be sufficiently reasonable to understand that.'' <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> bought peace, but <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> quickly overran all of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and started World War II with his invasion of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in 1939. <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON>'s successor as prime minister in 1940, sharply assailed his predecessor for signing the <ORGANIZATION> Munich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> died haunted by the words he blurted out to cheering crowds outside No. 10 Downing St. on Sept. 30, 1938, as he brandished the piece of paper he'd brought home that day. `` I believe it is peace in our time.'' Home, who as Sir <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas-Home </PERSON> served as prime minister himself in 1963-64, sticks to a generous judgment of the leader he served as parliamentary private secretary from 1937 to 1940. `` If you are a prime minister leading a democracy and you want the nation to go united into a war, then you've got to carry diplomacy as far as you conceivably can,'' Home said in the interview at his 50-room estate, <LOCATION> Castlemains </LOCATION>. Home, at 85, is still active politically as a member of the unelected House of Lords. Self-effacing and impeccably mannered, Home recalls both the chilling details and the vain hopes of the face-to-face talks with <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> was in a crude and rude and aggressive mood _ a very unattractive character,'' he said. `` But <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> was concerned to get this bit of paper out of him, which he'd drafted that morning himself, saying that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would settle their differences by peaceful means, so a bit of that short time was taken up with that.'' The rest consisted of allowing <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> to annex the Sudetenland from <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, which the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> overran entirely the following March. Six months later German troops marched into <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> finally declared war on Sept. 3, 1939. <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON>, <PERSON> Home </PERSON> said, never expressed any regrets about the <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> Pact, but knew he'd blundered with his `` peace in our time'' remark. `` As soon as he said the words, he knew that he'd made a mistake because it was an unjustifiable claim,'' Home added. `` He'd gone back to Downing Street from the aerodrome. The crowds were enormous. I was inside, we were packed like sardines, and I heard somebody on the staircase say to him, ` Well, <PERSON> Neville </PERSON>, go up to the historic window and say peace in our time.' `` And he turned on whoever it was _ I could n't see who is was _ and said, ` I do n't do that kind of thing,' ... and somebody in the next four or five yards must have said, ` Oh, <PERSON> Neville </PERSON>, look at the crowd, go on, do it.' And that's how it happened.'' Home said the justification for <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> is that it saved a vital year for British air rearmament. `` It could have made all the difference between victory and defeat.'' To <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>, who replaced <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> as prime minister in May 1940, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> `` chose shame'' at <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>. `` We have sustained a defeat without war, the consequences of which will travel far with us along our road,'' he declared in the House of Commons.

 When Premier <PERSON> Edouard </PERSON> <PERSON> Daladier </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> 50 years ago after signing the <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> Pact with <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>, <PERSON> Neville </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> and <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Mussolini </PERSON>, he received a delirious hero's welcome In most French eyes he had saved their country and averted war. But today, for many French citizens the <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> Pact and the name <PERSON> Daladier </PERSON> are synonymous with appeasement, even cowardice. It also may be one of the reasons why the pacifist movement has never gained much ground in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. `` To criticize somebody as a `` Munichois'' is an insult,'' said <PERSON> Jean-Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Azema </PERSON>, a historian at <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>' prestigious Political Science Institute. `` Somebody who lacks courage is called Munichois.'' Yet, at the time, the agreement that gave <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s Sudetenland to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was approved by 60-65 percent of the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> people, despite <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> military accords with the <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> government in force since World War I But the French themselves became the victims of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s ambitions when the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> occupied <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1940 <PERSON> Daladier </PERSON>, then minister of war, was interned by the collaborationist <PERSON> Vichy </PERSON> government. In 1943 he was taken to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and imprisoned until the end of the war. <PERSON> Daladier </PERSON> never recovered politically. He died in 1970, having never again held office. `` Even though his attitude during the war was irreproachable, he never recuperated politically because of <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Azema </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> generation is now in its twilight years. The majority of today's Frenchmen have no firsthand memory of the times, its dangers, its fears, its politics. Nonetheless, <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> remains a strong symbol. `` I have the impression that it rendered the French non-pacifist,'' said <PERSON> Azema </PERSON>, noting stronger movements in other European countries. `` Politically, mentally, pacifism was killed by <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>. No French politician can support a pacifist policy, a pacific policy yes, but not a pacifist policy.''

 The son of <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Mussolini </PERSON> remembers that <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s fascist dictator, like Prime Minister <PERSON> Neville </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, thought the <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> Pact of 1938 had saved the world from war `` I remember he came home from <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> and said, ` Peace is safe,''' said <PERSON> Vittorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Mussolini </PERSON>, who was 22 when his father went to the <ORGANIZATION> Munich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON> <PERSON> Spadolini </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> president of today's Italian <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and a professor of contemporary history at the Univeristy of <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> agreement to cede the <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s Sudentenland to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> `` generated negative beliefs within the dictatorships and within the democracies. `` <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> was convinced that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> would never have gone to war to defend the Eastern states,'' said <PERSON> Spadolini </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Mussolini </PERSON>, who had taken a role that was unnatural for him, that of the apostle of peace, was convinced of playing a determinant role within the Axis. Above all, <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> contributed to the infusing in him the ... conviction that the British were decadent and faint-hearted and could be provoked without impunity.'' Said <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> Bottai </PERSON>, the secretary general of the <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>: `` <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> was also the last conference in which the destiny of other peoples was decided in an abstract, arrogant way. `` Then, people thought they could still solve war and peace with political agreements, now we try to deal with this through the more complex mechanism of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, together with the concept of armaments reduction, which is new and more complex.'' Sen. <PERSON> Gaetano </PERSON> <PERSON> Arfe </PERSON>, a member of the independent left who also is professor of history of parties and political movements at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florence </ORGANIZATION>, said the advent of the atomic bomb marks a great difference between then and now. `` At the time, one could aim for war.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Half a century after the <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> Pact dismembered their country, many Czechs still feel they were betrayed by nations they thought were their allies. British, French and Italian leaders joined <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, in September 1938 to sign a pact allowing the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> to swallow the German-speaking Sudetenland. The following year, <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> occupied the remainder of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> as well and the nation no longer existed. `` In the history of nations there are events ... which even decades later bring about strong feelings of patriotism,'' historian <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Anger </PERSON> wrote in his book `` <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> 1938,'' published in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> this past August. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s president in 1938, <PERSON> Edvard </PERSON> <PERSON> Benes </PERSON>, had relied on a treaty with <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the loyalty of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to protect his country from <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s fascism. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> were the country's two main allies on which <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> had modeled its democracy. In a 1947 biography of <PERSON> Benes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Compton </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackenzie </PERSON> wrote: `` What finally broke <PERSON> Benes </PERSON>' heart was the betrayal of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.'' Bitter feelings have lasted long after the end of World War II and the reconstruction of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, including the <ORGANIZATION> Sudetenland </ORGANIZATION>, under <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leadership. <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>, who became the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader in December, said in February that the 1948 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> takeover guaranteed an alliance with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> instead of dependence `` on imperialist states, for which a tragic price was paid after <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>.'' However, many Czechs and Slovaks have felt equally betrayed by their Soviet allies. Many of them are younger people who are bitter about the Soviet-led invasion 30 years later to crush the `` Prague Spring'' of reforms. On the 30th anniversary of the <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> Pact in 1968, Czechoslovaks were reeling from the shock of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invastion Aug. 20-21 that crushed the reform movement of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader at the time. On Aug. 21 of this year, thousands of mostly young Czechoslovaks turned out on <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> to protest the 1968 invasion. An estimated 10,000 demonstrators chanted `` Dubcek'' and demands for truth and freedom. While bitter about <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, Czechoslavaks see the Nazi era as being over and West German visitors today are warmly welcomed in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. `` We usually hate the most those we have loved the most, and vice versa,'' said one long-time political observer who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` Look at the eager welcome given to the thousands of West Germans swarming the streets of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> today. One could almost forget the way they -LRB- Germans -RRB- came to this country 50 years ago.''

<HEAD>The Lure of Dividends Return</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When the stock market acts like a bull, many investors concentrate on capital appreciation and all but forget dividends. The reason why is hardly complex, since almost anyone is likely to be attracted to a one-day leap of $ 1 a share vs. a dividend that might amount to less than that for an entire year. But when the market stalls, as it seems now to be doing, interest in dividends returns. Newsletter writers tout high-dividend stocks and brokers offer clients their lists of prospects for dividend increases. When the talk is about dividends, you know the spirit of the marketplace has changed, that it has become calmer, more realistic, more attuned to economic conditions and, most likely, healthier. Smart investors, however, never lose interest in dividend yields, even when others are talking about huge one-day profits and the promoters are talking about a new era and new levels of prosperity. The dividend collectors, however, know that over the long run they sometimes can make more in dividends a bit at a time than others might make _ and lose _ in sharply fluctuating prices. <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, one of the new-breed market researchers who rely on cold, hard, provable data in contrast to the emotions, promotions and shenanigans that predominated from 1982 to 1987, offers this evidence: _ Over the past 38 years, the total return on the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500-stock index has averaged 11.4 percent Of this, 4.6 percent came from dividends, the rest from capital appreciation. _ Reinvestment of dividends over a long period of time can boost an investor's wealth enormously Little dividends become big sums when compounded; that is, when dividends reinvested earn dividends themselves. If you had invested $ 1,000 in the S & amp; P beginning in 1926, and withdrawn all dividends during that time, your investment would have been worth $ 19,366 by the end of 1987. But, had you reinvested all the dividend payments so that they in turn could earn dividends, your portfolio during the same time would have grown to $ 347,956. Such evidence is not new, but it still arrives with a shock on the current market scene, having been scorned for years by a public that believed a stock puchased in the morning should show a gain by afternoon. Dividends can not do that, since seldom are they offered more than once in three months. Moreover, you must pay taxes on dividends, whereas you can defer any tax on capital gains until you sell. There are other reasons, too, why dividends fall out of favor during bull markets, chief of them being the notion that dividend-paying companies are too plodding, too conservative, too slow-growing. But when the marketplace returns to its senses, as it probably has now, the beauty of dividends returns to its proper place in investment philosophies.

 The nation's automakers, their regulators and their critics agree on this: There is more to fuel economy than saving gasoline. On a single mile per gallon, to hear the interested parties tell it, hangs the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade balance, the ability of the domestic auto industry to compete, the nation's energy independence, thousands of highway traffic deaths, even the capacity of the Earth's climate to support humankind. A welter of comment offered at hearings this past week lead to those assorted conclusions. It now falls to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to weigh those competing interests and issue a decision on where fuel consumption standards ought to be set in the future. In many respects, fuel economy is a 1970s issue hitching a ride on the concerns of the 1980s and the 1990s. Beginning in 1972, oil producing nations, mainly in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, raised oil prices dramatically. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1975 responded with legislation to reduce the nation's reliance on foreign oil by forcing <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> to build more fuel-efficient cars. The law phased in a minimum gas mileage each manufacturer on average must attain. The corporate average fuel economy _ shortened to CAFE and pronounced like a small eatery _ is calculated on the basis of gallons of gasoline used by a maker's domestic car production over the estimated life of the vehicles. The CAFE standard in 1985 reached 27.5 mpg. The next year it was lowered to 26 mpg by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> after some of the automakers argued that, for technological and commercial reasons, they could not meet the stricter standard. The standard was scheduled to revert to 27.5 mpg with the 1989 model year. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> in August proposed setting the CAFE standard through 1990 somewhere between 26.5 mpg and 27.5 mpg. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> oppose setting the standard at the higher end of the range. They said they could live with a 26.5 mpg standard, but the question is one of trade and jobs. To meet a 27.5 mpg CAFE standard, the two largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers said they would have to restrict production of large cars. The result, they said, would be layoffs at large-car assembly plants. The job losses would cascade through the manufacturers' suppliers and into the general economy, ultimately numbering in the hundreds of thousands Analysts buy the argument that the stricter fuel-economy standard would pinch <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think you would have more problems, because Americans want to buy horsepower and big cars,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON>, an analyst with the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> brokerage house <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It probably would n't be a disaster; it would be more of a pain for the companies than it is now.'' A pain for <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> would be a boon for the foreign automakers, particularly the Japanese, and detrimental to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> balance of trade, both the automakers and analysts said. Large and luxury cars accounted for about 19 percent of the 5.2 million domestic cars sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this year through August, according to industry reports. All but one of those models were made by <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> makes one big car. Most imported cars are smaller vehicles. Even if the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> makers restricted big-car production, they would still make some of the high-profit vehicles, thereby diluting the average gas mileage of their fleets. To offset that production, `` they have to have a lower performance -LRB- small -RRB- car than the importers, because the importers do n't have to balance their small cars aginst the higher fuel-usage cars,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Grady </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>. Therefore, even buyers of small cars would tend to gravitate to higher-performance imported vehicles. Against that bread-and-butter question lie other issues, some divorced from the orginal conservation intent of the law. Some want CAFE loosened to lower the highway death toll. The <ORGANIZATION> Competitive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a free-market advocacy group, argued that setting the standard at 27.5 mpg would lead to between 2,200 and 3,900 additional deaths over the life of 1989 cars because people are more likely to be killed in crashes involving smaller vehicles. Others want the mileage standards tightened in order to protect the environment. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, a group of 20 environmental and conservation grups, argued that loosening the CAFE standard, by putting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, would accelerate the greenhouse effect, a warming of the atmosphere caused by a trapping of the sun's heat, with disastrous effects for world's food-growing ability in the next century. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and others point to gasoline prices averaging 97 cents per gallon, far lower than forecast during the height of the oil crunch, and say the law has outlived its original intent and should be scrapped. Still others, such as the Center for Auto Safety, a consumers group often critical of the auto industry and its regulators, say the conservation issue is still important, with oil imports standing at 38.1 percent this year, against 36.8 percent when the CAFE law was passed. A new energy crisis, they argue, is something for which the nation should be prepared. The CAFE decision, the conflicting comment suggests, is a question of public priorities, a balance between the economic health of the auto industry and broader political, safety and environmental concerns. A ruling is expected within a few weeks.

<HEAD>Real Traders Enliven Movie Set In Soybean Pit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Four and a half years in the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond pit have taught <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> that the popular image of futures traders as overnight millionaires is a myth. Two days of playing a soybean trader in the upcoming film comedy `` Limit Up'' convinced White that his own perception of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> movie-making was also at odds with reality. Instead of glitter and glamor, White and 13 other real-life traders from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, who were recruited to add authenticity to the production, found the experience downright tedious. `` You're filming 10 percent of the time and 90 percent of the time you're standing around waiting for them to set the cameras and lights,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. And those lights were hot. `` I was sweating more than I do in the pit I trade in every day,'' the 29-year-old independent trader said last week during a break from the hectic pace of the T-bond arena. `` Hot'' also could describe the group's performance as soybean traders whipped into a buying frenzy by rumors of a large Soviet grain purchase, said director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Martini </PERSON>, a Chicago-area native who also wrote the screenplay for `` Limit Up.'' `` It just electrified everyone in the company,'' <PERSON> Martini </PERSON>, 33, said in a telephone interview from the set on the trading floor of the old <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> building in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` The actors were incredibly impressed with their energy and what these guys do,'' <PERSON> Martini </PERSON> said. `` Some of these guys who came out here had traded together for 25 years and you just ca n't get that from <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Martini </PERSON>'s older brother <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION> trader who served as a consultant on the production, said the realistically raucous trading scenes drew wild applause from onlookers. `` All sorts of heavyweights were coming over to the set,'' he said. `` They'd never seen anything like it.'' The attention was welcomed by <PERSON> White </PERSON>, who said he went to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> harboring a fantasy of being discovered. `` I'm available any time for any other production for any film,'' he said. `` I'd gladly trade spots.'' <PERSON> Martini </PERSON>'s previous credits include the screenplay for the 1987 comedy `` Three For The Road'' and `` Ca n't Hurry Love,'' a 1988 release that he wrote and directed. `` Limit Up'' stars <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockwell </PERSON>, `` Saturday Night Live'' alumni <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Danitra </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>. The movie is being produced by <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and is scheduled for release next spring, said <ORGANIZATION> MCEG </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>. The movie's title refers to a sharp upward move in the price of a commodity traded on a futures exchange. Exchanges usually limit the amount that prices can move in either direction. <PERSON> Martini </PERSON> said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> plays a low-level employee of a trading company at the fictitious <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> who sells her soul to the devil -LRB- Miss <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> -RRB- to become a successful soybean trader. <PERSON> Stockwell </PERSON> plays her arch-rival in the soybean pit and she falls in love with <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, who plays a broker. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> plays God. The director said he envisions `` Limit Up'' as a cross between the Christmas classic `` It's A Wonderful Life'' and `` Trading Places,'' the 1983 comedy hit about commodities trading that featured <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Aykroyd </PERSON>. <PERSON> Martini </PERSON> said he asked a friend at the Board of Trade to recruit some traders for his movie because he wanted to realistically portray `` the integrity of bean traders, the camaraderie between them ... how they are like gladiators in the Roman arena fighting for the world food supply.'' Despite such high praise, the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> contingent returned home with their visions of <LOCATION> Tinseltown </LOCATION> a bit tarnished. `` Maybe I thought we'd be involved more,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> lamented. `` Hollywood's very glamorous,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a 42-year-old grain trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, `` but the actual making of fils is very boring.''

<HEAD>Toyota Unit Makes Rare Foray By Japanese into US Public Debt
Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bond market, which has proven attractive in recent years for Japanese investors, showed it can be gracious on those rare occasions when it gets a call from a borrower affiliated with a Japanese company. The market provided a warm reception this past week for a $ 200 million issue of three-year notes from <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> finance subsidiary of the Japanese automaker <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The notes, sold in denominations of $ 1,000, were priced to yield 8.826 percent, or a slim 38-hundredths of a percentage point more than <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities with a similar maturity. `` We were very pleased. It went very well and sold out within one hour,'' said <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Jahn </PERSON>, vice president for <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Torrance </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. He said while the company has no specific plans for additional offerings, he said he expects to be back. According to the research firm <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the sale was the first straight public debt offering in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 10 years by an affiliate of a Japanese company other than a bank or a concern controlled by the government. The last such issue was the sale a $ 20 million in five-year notes by <ORGANIZATION> Ito-Yokado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a Japanese department store company, in June 1978, according to <PERSON> Fran </PERSON> <PERSON> Wissak </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lerner </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION>, which led the underwriters of the issue, said Japanese companies have been deterred from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> debt market because of <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> requirements. But he said he suspects other Japanese companies will be watching the <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> note sale and may be encouraged to try it as well. A wholly-owned subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sales </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> makes loans to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Toyota dealers and their customers. It has grown rapidly over the past three years, and counts over $ 3 billion in accounts receivable on its books, according to <PERSON> Jahn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jahn </PERSON> said the company started out raising money in the Euromarkets because they offered ready access and cheaper rates, initially, than the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets. But <PERSON> Jahn </PERSON> said as the company's growth accelerated, it found it needed to return to the Euromarket more frequently. Over the past three years, he said <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> raised $ 2 billion in 16 separate offerings and that in recent months, found itself going back to the market with new offerings every six to eight months. `` We realized that we could n't raise all our funds in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` It was time for us to enter the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. market.'' <PERSON> Lerner </PERSON> said <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> worked for nine months to come up with documents acceptable to the company and the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. He said a first-time issuer could get into the Euromarkets, on the other hand, in two weeks. Nonetheless, <PERSON> Jahn </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> wanted `` to make sure we have the capability of going into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market'' to accommodate the company's expected growth. `` It is the deepest and most liquid debt market in the world,'' added <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Misteli </PERSON>, assistant treasurer at <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lerner </PERSON> said he expects <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> will become one of the most active issuers in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> debt markets within two years, joining a group that included the financing arms of the Big Three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers. He said other Japanese companies may also decide to start borrowing here. The increasing frequency of Japanese acquisitions in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may accelerate that development as Japanese companies look for new sources of funds to help them finance those purchases, he said. `` Now that a major leader among Japanese companies has taken this initial step, other Japanese companies will follow suit,'' he said.

<HEAD>Wall Street Not Yet Wowed by Signs of Slowing Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the effort to revive the sagging securities markets of Wall Street, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy certainly has been doing its part. Early this year, when stocks were weighed down by fears of a recession, the economy put on a burst of impressive growth. Now, amid worries about inflation and tighter credit, business activity appears to be obliging by slowing down to a safer, more sustainable speed. But the traders and money managers who make the markets go still seem unsatisfied. And that has left many observers wondering just what it is the markets want. Consider the government's latest report on international trade, which read like a prescription specifically written to cure the markets' ills. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> figures, issued on Wednesday, showed a much larger than expected narrowing in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit, to $ 9.53 billion in July from $ 13.22 billion in June. In the prevailing view of things on Wall Street, the deficit was headed in the right direction for the right reason _ an 8.9 percent drop in imports, while exports continued to increase. The implication was that the worldwide markets for goods produced in this country remained strong and that domestic demand was slowing enough at the same time to cool inflation worries. The stock market did indeed rally on the news, but the advance had a half-hearted ring to it. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed Wednesday with a gain of 17.60 points. By the next day, the market was back in the sluggish, drifting pattern that has predominated since mid-summer. `` The initial reports on the economy's health in August were unexpectedly weak,'' said <PERSON> Maury </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, economist at <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` But one month is not a trend. `` The erratic course of monthly data suggests it is premature to conclude that the economy is registering the slowdown from above-average growth which is a prerequisite for lower interest rates.'' Similarly, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Straszheim </PERSON>, economist at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>, said any conclusion about slower growth is `` probably premature.'' The latest trend in data on unemployment claims, <PERSON> Straszheim </PERSON> observed, `` suggests that employment growth will pick up in September and that the unemployment rate will decline.'' Growth in the gross national product is n't likely to slow until late this year, he said, and even then it will probably be stronger than the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> wants to see in its campaign to restrain inflation. `` Recent indicators have delayed the next tightening by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>,'' he conceded, `` but the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is still likely to tighten further.'' In the face of such restraining comments, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average settled for a 29.34-point gain to 2,098.15 in the past week. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index rose 1.97 to 152.79; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market climbed 2.31 to 383.91; and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index was up .77 at 298.22. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 165.38 million shares a day, against 138.17 million the week before. Should the economy begin a sustained slowdown that Wall Streeters accept as the real thing, will that mean clear sailing for the markets? Perhaps, analysts say. But there is also the distinct possibility that investors will begin to worry in earnest about the possibility of a recession. At some point, more and more investors are likely to question whether the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> and other central banks can engineer an anti-inflationary economic slowdown without bringing on a more serious slump. Says <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Applegate </PERSON> at the firm of <ORGANIZATION> Tucker </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anthony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; R.L. Day Inc., `` The extreme economic risk is recession, not boom.''

 Oil futures prices declined in moderate trading as the market shifted its attention from Hurricane Gilbert to the oversupply of oil around the world. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the October contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, settled 33 cents lower at $ 14.57 a 42-gallon barrel Friday compared with Thursday's closing price of $ 14.90 a barrel. Other contract months also settled lower. Wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery closed down 1.41 cents at 44.22 cents a gallon compared with 45.63 cents a gallon on Thursday. The contract rose more than 3 cents on Wednesday on fears of a hurricane-induced gasoline shortage. The October wholesale heating oil contract fell 1.33 cents a gallon to close at 41.37 cents a gallon, compared with 42.70 cents on Thursday. Analysts said the market opened lower and traded in a narrow range Friday before weakening at the end of the day along with the prospects of a disruption in domestic gasoline and crude oil supplies in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The market had rallied earlier in the week on reports the hurricane was approaching the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> coastline near <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and that many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> refineries had ceased operations. But by Thursday, analysts said the focus shifted to production concerns as threats of a hurricane doing serious damage dissipated. By Friday companies which had evacuated workers from oil platforms announced they were resuming operations. `` Once the hurricane is off the front pages, the market will be back to looking at the supply and demand situation and I do n't think that looks constructive,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Byers </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Reports this week indicated the 13-member <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> had reduced its production last month, from 20 million barrels a day to below 19 million, but still more than the market can absorb, according to That preceded an announcement that the cartel's price monitoring committee would meet Sept. 25 and 26, suggesting that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> might be serious about setting production limits that would strengthen world oil prices. But on Thursday, Iraqi's oil minister slowed the market's upward momentum by announcing his country would not lower its oil output and might raise its production instead. `` That dampens any optimism about what could come out of an <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meeting,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Azarow </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has refused to abide by its OPEC-assigned quota of 1.5 million barrels a day and is reported to be producing about 2.7 million barrels a day Some observers hoped that after a recent cease-fire in its 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> would join with other <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> nations in restraining production.

<HEAD>Business Inventories Rise Slowly In Sign Of Economy's Strength</HEAD>

 Investors who had second thoughts after they bought gold as a hedge against inflation have pushed the price of the precious metal lower. Gold prices continued to tumble Friday, shedding nearly $ 7 a troy ounce. The plunge brought the two-day decline in gold prices to roughly $ 18 an ounce and left gold at its lowest point since March 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> quoted gold bullion at $ 411.75 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT. Unlike stocks and bonds, gold does not provide dividends. Its main merit is it keeps its value when paper investments are eroded by inflation. But inflation has been lower than gold investors had expected. `` These people are disappointed and shocked and adding fuel to the fire,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, vice president and bullion dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. `` The more selling that comes in, the more these people are in a panic.'' In other markets Friday, stocks gained some ground and the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.87 to 2,098.15. The dollar was mixed and bonds drifted slightly lower in sluggish trading. The government said Friday business inventories rose in July at the slowest rate in 11 months, an indication sales were strong enough to keep goods from piling up on the shelves. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said inventories rose 0.3 percent _ the smallest rise since one of 0.2 percent in August 1987. Economists believe businesses have been intentionally adding to their inventories in a small way to have a buffer for continued strong sales. Business sales fell 0.2 percent in July, but the decline was not considered worrisome because it followed a strong 1.4 percent jump in June. `` When you put June and July together, sales are still growing strongly,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Annable </PERSON>, chief economist of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>.
