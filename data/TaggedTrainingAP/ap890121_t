 Mortar shells from fighting between <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> troops and rebel forces destroyed 55 houses and wounded two people at a village just inside the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border, a senior police officer said today. Col. <PERSON> Amphol </PERSON> <PERSON> Ngamchit </PERSON>, police chief of <ORGANIZATION> Tak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION>, said a woman and a young girl were wounded in <LOCATION> Mae </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salit </LOCATION> village, which straddles the Burma-Thailand frontier. Damage was estimated at $ 500,000. The fighting Friday was part of an intensified campaign by the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> military against the <ORGANIZATION> Karen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, the strongest of a dozen ethnic minority organizations seeking greater autonomy. The Karen groups fields about 4,000 guerrillas and operates primarily along the rugged <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border. Brig.

 The victims arrive day and night at the sand-bagged <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>: men with shattered legs or stomachs ripped open by bullets, and children burned by anti-missile flares. There are fears of worse to come as the last of the Soviet troops depart <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in the next few weeks to try to meet a Feb. 15 deadline. The nation's pro-Marxist regime led by President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> will be left with its poorly trained army to face the guerrillas alone, and some Western diplomats say the guerrillas will win. Gunfire and explosions have been heard regularly the past few nights, and rifle-toting Afghan soldiers are deployed throughout the city. The Swiss-run <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> opened the 50-bed hospital in October in a villa beside the frozen <LOCATION> Kophen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. It has 16 foreign and 140 Afghan staff members. Victims arrive in ancient taxis or are carried by relatives. Some of the latest arrivals were shot or wounded hours earlier by mines, which are planted around <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and villages in the surrounding hills. Other victims were wounded weeks or months ago and have infected limbs, sometimes the result of botched surgery at government hospitals. As several victims arrived, <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON>, the Swedish chief nurse, cajoled an apprehensive middle-aged man into giving blood for the relative he had brought in with shrapnel wounds to the chest. Minutes later word came that seven more patients were on their way. Nurses chased relatives from a waiting area to make room, and set up brightly colored lounge chairs as temporary beds. `` There's a lot of shooting in the city. Most of the ones coming now seem to have been hit by stray bullets,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Kari </PERSON> <PERSON> Koskinen </PERSON>, a Finnish surgeon. <PERSON> Koskinen </PERSON>'s three-member team and one led by Dr. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewitson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> surgeon who arrived this week, alternate shifts and are on call around the clock. Most of the foreign staff, from a half-dozen Western European countries and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, have worked civil wars in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s refugee camps. Many say they sense there is a lot more killing to come in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in April 1978, and Soviet troops entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979. Since then, an estimated 1 million people have been killed in the civil war, and one-third of the nation's population of 15 million has sought refuge in neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. In the past two weeks, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> has readied a 100-bed extension to the hospital. `` I just have the impression that this is the beginning of a very, very bad time,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Keusen </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> radiographer and laboratory technician who arrived eight months ago from <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>. `` We could set up a hospital for 500 patients, for 1,000, it would still be too small.'' But somehow, the hospital staff finds room for the wounded. Beds are jammed together. An old man with leg injuries lay semi-conscious next to a cheerful 12-year-old boy who was shot in the spine four months ago during a clash betweeen guerrillas and government troops outside <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The boy will never walk again. A 10-year-old girl shows a visitor the healing burns that cover her left leg. At the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> artificial limb center in the city's industrial district, French physiotherapist <PERSON> Christoph </PERSON> <PERSON> Etienne </PERSON> makes tough choices daily. There's a waiting list of 1,500. Most of the patients are disabled soldiers, but women and children get priority, followed by young men over old, and amputees with one leg over people who have lost both legs and are least capable of using artificial limbs. The center opened in 1987, making it the first international facility the Afghan government allowed into the country to help the war-wounded. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> has run hospitals and clinics in <LOCATION> Pakinstan </LOCATION> throughout most of the <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> conflict, mainly serving civilians and guerrillas.

 Thousands of jubilant Republicans celebrated <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s brand-new presidency at 11 inaugural balls Friday night, and during a fast-paced tour of the merrymaking <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took a few reluctant whirls around the dance floor. He called himself `` a lousy dancer'' and told one crowd rocking to the music of <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>: `` I hope you do n't judge my being a president by the way I dance.'' A chill wind whipped evening gowns and fur stoles as 60,000 party faithful thronged from Union Station to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and Space Museum to the Kennedy Center on the banks of the moonlit <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> for a night of dancing and carousing. Inside the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the air was hot and thick as 5,000 guests were jammed shoulder-to-shoulder in the Grand Foyer to awaiting the president's arrival. Several people fainted, and for one woman, the crowd was so dense that she could n't fall down after she passed out. Hours after he was sworn in as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s successor on the steps of the Capitol, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> began his tour of the invitation-only balls with a visit to an American Legion affair for 149 Medal of Honor winners _ including freshman Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON>, D-Neb. _ and other military heroes. `` I'll do my level best to be a president who respects the military ... and keeps the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> strong,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was accompanied by former Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>, R-Ill., his choice to be secretary of the new Department of Veterans Affairs <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also let slip that he's not particularly keen on dancing. `` This is the first formal event ... and perhaps the most humane,'' he said, `` a ball at which you do not have to dance.'' But by the time he reached Union Station, the president finally took his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, onto the dance floor as the band struck up `` I Could Have Danced All Night.'' `` You can say that you saw it first here,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` a lousy dancer trying to dance his first dance with the first lady of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' A while later, at the cavernous Pension Building, the president quipped, `` the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> family is going to give dancing a bad name.'' He took a few turns with Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and stopped abruptly. `` That's it,'' he said. `` That's the only step I know.'' Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> apparently felt the same way. He told revelers at another hotel ballroom that `` I guess protocol allows you to witness my inability to dance.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> then took a few stiff turns on the dance floor with his wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, as the band played a tune from `` My Fair Lady.'' Tickets to the nine crowded black-tie balls sold for $ 175 each, assuring guests the privilege of jostling for drinks at cash bars and catching brief glimpses of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Tickets were easier t obtain for two casual-dress balls for the 30-and-under crowd, where the drinks had more fizz than kick. `` To be included in this is incredible,'' said <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Trost </PERSON>, 16, of <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, who got her $ 30 ticket from a friend and joined several thousand other youngsters in dancing to loud recorded rock music and videos. When <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> showed up at one of the youth balls, he recalled the inaugural parade and said, `` It was the young people that brought that thing alive.'' Outside one hotel, a group protesting the killing of animals for their fur hides picketed arriving guests, many of whom wore fur coats. The demonstrators carried signs reading, `` Fur Is Murder'' and `` I'm Warm. I'm Not Wearing Fur.'' A star of one hotel ball was 7-year-old <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Catonia </PERSON>, the current <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION>. The girl's mother, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, said her daughter was conceived at the same hotel during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first inauguration in 1981. Before the hoopla began, inaugural officials had said a $ 175 ticket to the black-tie events, reserved for invited guests, would get them little more than `` the honor of being there.'' Bars at each site were charging for drinks, there was no food and the dance floors promised to be gridlocked. The partying continues Saturday with scores of social events around the capital, including a `` Black Tie and Boots'' ball for 5,500 Texans that sold out within 24 hours. The four days of inaugural festivities costing a record $ 22 million to $ 25 million will end with a Sunday morning worship service at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Cathedral which was requested by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. One highlight of the week was a two-hour variety show Thursday night at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Convention Center, where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> joined 12,000 black-tie guests in applauding big-name performers from <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> to country singer <PERSON> Loretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>. The gala was broadcast live on television and grossed about $ 9 million from ticket and TV commercial sales to help defray costs of the privately financed inauguration week. Meanwhile, those protesting the policies of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and what they fear will be those of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration held their own Counter-Inaugural Ball at the <ORGANIZATION> Crispus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attucks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> on Friday night, with a $ 6 to $ 10 sliding scale admission charge. The dance party was arranged by the <ORGANIZATION> Counter-Inaugural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> a </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agenda </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of 80 groups ranging from the <ORGANIZATION> Gray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION> to the Student Coalition Against Apartheid and Racism. Those attending were asked to wear `` their finest trash,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasty </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Peace Center, a member of the coalition. Live music was planned for the first hour, followed by a disk jockey playing tapes `` so people can dance the night away.''

<HEAD>Restaurateur Defends Exotic Male Dance Fund-raiser For Shelter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLARKSBURG, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A restaurateur who held an exotic male-dance show to raise money for a shelter for the homeless says she does n't understand why some people objected to the show. `` I ca n't understand the uproar'' over Friday's show, said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Beaudin </PERSON>, owner of the <LOCATION> Mountainview </LOCATION> Restaurant in this northwestern <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> town. `` I just thought it would be nice -LRB- for patrons -RRB- to donate $ 10 and get something in return.'' However, some people in nearby <PERSON> North </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> strenuously objected to the show, saying they believed it was in poor taste. `` I do n't think it's right to hire male dancers for a cause like this,'' said City Council Member <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Babeu </PERSON>. `` It tarnishes it somewhat.'' Ms. <PERSON> Beaudin </PERSON> said she sold all 220 tickets nearly a week before the two-hour performance, and said she was pleased it all worked out well. `` Now I feel fine,'' she said. `` I was just hoping it went well because it really is to benefit the homeless. People are just having a good time.'' Ticket sales brought in about $ 2,000. The money will go to a 24-bed shelter for the area's homeless, which welfare workers say is urgently needed to house the increasing numbers of families seeking shelter. <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Berkshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> Action _ a branch of the private, non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Berkshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> which uses state grants to help the homeless _ has been handling 10 to 15 family or individual cases a month, said branch Director <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Louison </PERSON>. That compares with one case every month or two five years ago. Ms. <PERSON> Beaudin </PERSON> said the situation prompted her to look for a creative solution. She held a spaghetti supper fund-raiser in November, but made only $ 900. She said she saw the dance as an easier way to raise money. The <LOCATION> Clarksburg </LOCATION> board of selectmen waived the usual $ 75 entertainment license fee so Ms. <PERSON> Beaudin </PERSON> could use the money to hire police guards. `` She has the right to put it on if it's done properly and there is no physical contact,'' said <PERSON> Selectman </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Deneault </PERSON>, who added that he had heard no complaints from people in the town of 1,890 people. `` Most of the people doing the complaining are from <PERSON> North </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> successfully tested its redesigned space shuttle booster Friday, firing the rocket in colder weather than that which contributed to the Challenger disaster. `` The nation has a new president today and a new success in its space flight program,'' said <PERSON> Royce </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s solid-fuel rocket motor project manager at the <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala </LOCATION>. The $ 20 million test, the last of six qualifying tests, was designed to show the strength of the rocket's casing and the behavior of its solid-fuel propellant, which has n't as much `` oomph'' in cold weather, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. Early test data showed the propellant's burn rate was normal for the conditions and there was no evidence of the uneven burning that could have occurred at that temperature, he said. The horizontal 126-foot-long booster, its 1.1 million pounds of propellant chilled to a coldest-ever 40 degrees, was fired for 125 seconds at the company's <ORGANIZATION> Wasatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> center 25 miles west of here. The bright orange plume from the rocket's tail melted the snow from a nearby hillside during the test, which was delayed for 90 minutes by a lack of wind to blow away dust from the blast. About 300 company and space officials cheered as the rocket ignited. If post-test analysis turns up no serious problems, the experiment will qualify the rocket for cold-weather launches, although further testing on a smaller scale is planned, said <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, vice president of engineering for space operations. Identical boosters already have been used on two shuttle flights in the four months since <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s return to manned space flight. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> ordered <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> to redesign the booster after a Jan. 28, 1986, explosion destroyed the shuttle Challenger and killed its seven astronauts. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> required only five qualifying tests before the shuttle program resumed with the launch of Discovery on Sept. 29. The shuttle Atlantis was sent into space Dec. 2, and in both cases the boosters performed with no problems. A presidential commission blamed the Challenger disaster on a booster joint that allowed a plume of superhot gas to burn through an O-ring, triggering the explosion of the craft's liquid fuel tank. Investigators also found that freezing temperatures the night before the launch stiffened the joint's rubber-like O-ring seal, causing it to lose pliability and contributing to the failure.

 Nets, firecrackers and recordings of killer whales have n't stopped sea lions from gobbling trout and salmon swimming through a ship canal, so wildlife officials are going to send the overeaters into exile. This year's run of steelhead, a seagoing rainbow trout that returns to fresh water to spawn, was about 1,650 at a fish ladder that lets fish bypass a set of locks, down from about 2,600 last year, officials said this week. Seven to nine <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> sea lions `` hanging around'' the locks are gulping an average of 14 fish a day each, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, state <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. Despite a net barrier erected last year, the 300 - to 800-pound animals ate 53 percent of the run, <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> said Sea lions eat 5 percent of their body weight daily, said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON>, a department spokeswoman. The new plan calls for installing a cage near the mouth of Salmon Bay below the locks on the <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> section, said <PERSON> Tag </PERSON> <PERSON> Gornall </PERSON>, a Marine Animal Resource Center veterinarian The cage of five-sixteenths-inch steel mesh will be mounted on a buoy that was a favorite sea lion resting place and will have a trap door that can be closed by rope from a nearby boat, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLong </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> mammals laboratory. Sea lions heading for their usual easy pickings in the pool below the fish ladder at the locks will be trapped, tagged with radio collars and trucked about 200 miles to the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, just north of the mouth of the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, and released on the coast. <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> was chosen `` because you ca n't extradite them,'' <PERSON> Gornall </PERSON> said, `` and besides <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> have enough of their own sea lions and do n't want any more.'' Asked about the difficulty of moving one of the animals, <PERSON> DeLong </PERSON> said it could be about the same as moving a `` leather bag filled with 600 pounds of rocks.'' <PERSON> DeLong </PERSON> said he expects the sea lions will be back for more fish, perhaps as soon as five days after they are removed. He said the animals migrate from their <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> breeding grounds every year and they know the route. `` I reckon they'll know where they are when we put them off the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast,'' he said. The operation will begin as soon as the cage is completed, said Ms. <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON>. The feasting sea lions have been the bane of fishermen and others concerned about the salmon run but have delighted residents and tourists who flock to the locks to watch the spectacle and applaud the frolicking animals. The sea lions have become a problem at the locks only in the last couple of years. Scientists have said sea-lion populations have been growing since federal legislation protecting marine mammals took effect several years ago. Only one or two sea lions feasted outside the <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> in 1984, but others caught on quickly, <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON> said. `` They kind of see their buddies over there. Since 1984 that one or two has grown to the neighborhood of 20 problem animals,'' she said. Along with firecracker noisemakers and recordings of sea lion predators such as killer whales, offerings of dead fish injected with a sickening substance failed as deterrents. Rubber bullets have been rejected _ for now. `` We must exhaust all other viable options before we even consider shooting the sea lions _ the last option,'' <PERSON> Gornall </PERSON> said. `` We're trying to save and manage the fishery and the animals.''

 Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife say there are no movie parts in his future, but they both plan to keep busy in the home state that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says is not so much a place as a way of life. `` I do n't even use the word retirement,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told reporters aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> plane that flew him here Friday after the inauguration of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The former president and first lady came back toward the reporters' seats early in their flight West and answered questions for about 20 minutes. When the plane arrived at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> were greeted by an enthusiastic crowd and then driven to their new home in the fashionable Bel Air neighborhood by motorcade. Their spokesman, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>, said they planned a private weekend and no announcements would be made about their activities. `` We're just moving into a new house,'' said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` We did n't get the job done over the holidays when we were there. The <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> slept a total of nine nights in the home around Christmas and just after New Year's Day. `` Obviously, we have to unpack,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, a movie actor before he entered politics, was asked if he could n't be tempted to re-enter films, even in a cameo part. `` No, there is kind of a lingering feeling that would look a little bit like trying to cash in on this job that I've had,'' he said. But, a reporter asked, aside from making money, would n't it be appropriate to go back to what he did before politics? `` Well ...'' said the former president. `` You do n't go back,'' said his wife. `` No,'' he agreed. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he plans to write a book and to speak out on behalf of such causes as a presidential line-item veto, a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution and repeal of the two-term limit for presidents. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said she does n't believe in retirement either and plans to finish a book she is writing and work on behalf of a drug abuse treatment center she is backing in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who had changed to a blue <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jacket with his name on the pocket after boarding the plane, told reporters he was prepared to hand over power to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` For a long time I had to accept this day and know it was coming,'' he said. Returning to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, he said, `` will be a return to a life we did love very much. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is n't a place in my mind, it's a way of life, so that is the sweet part of the bittersweet experience.'' There was just one more thing, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, that the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> wanted to clear up. `` He never took naps,'' she said, bringing the subject up herself. `` No, in eight years, he never took a nap.'' `` She sometimes gets edgy because she thinks I should be able to take a nap,'' the former president said. At the airport <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the crowd it had been `` a bittersweet several hours this day'' and added, `` I have to warn you, when you have to stay eight years away from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> excerpt for an occasional visit, you live in a perpetual state of homesickness.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spent 458 days in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> during his eight years as president. By contrast, his predecessor, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, spent 77 days in his native <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> during his one four-year term.

 Protesters rebuked President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on his Inauguration Day by twisting his oft-mentioned `` thousand points of light'' into their own `` thousand lights for women's rights'' and `` 1,000 sparks of dissent.'' Nearly 1,000 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> demonstrators strewn through the inaugural parade crowd of 300,000 wore buttons Friday that lighted up to read, `` Keep Abortion Legal.'' `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ca n't get to the White House without knowing there are a lot of us who feel very strongly about our constitutional rights,'' said NOW President <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Yard </PERSON>. In a separate demonstration, four <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> women _ three wearing rubber masks of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ marched along the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> sidewalk wearing signs protesting the extravagance of the inauguration and contrasting it to the nation's need to address problems of the homeless, AIDS and other social issues. `` This is pretty much like a coronation in a monarchy,'' said <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Barehr </PERSON>. `` The only difference is <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is n't <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s son. As the Bushes moved by in their car, other protesters shook their fists and jeered, but were virtually drowned out by cheers. Meanwhile, members of the <ORGANIZATION> Counter-Inaugural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> a </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agenda </ORGANIZATION> _ a coalition of 80 groups ranging from the <ORGANIZATION> Gray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in Solidarity with the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION> _ distributed thousands of leaflets calling for changes in administration policies. Their slogan was `` 1,000 sparks of dissent.'' The coalition called for all people to `` have the right to adequate food, housing, clothing and quality health care and education.'' In addition, the coalition called for a clean environment, the right to safe, legal abortions, and no discrimination against minority groups or AIDS victims. `` We demand a government responsive to the needs of the people and the planet rather than corporate and military interests,'' the group said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is looking for a kind of radar that can spot orbiting debris as small as a dime which someday could pose a hazard to its planned space station. The space agency has access to space debris reports from the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, but it says information is still `` extremely limited about the number and size of small debris pieces at the operational altitude range of the space station.'' The station will operate 180 to 360 miles above <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> needs radar that can see debris as small as one centimeter in diameter, compared with the 10-centimeter capability of current systems. The new equipment also would need to calculate the altitude of the objects. A request issued this week for proposals specifies that the new system must be available by October 1991. The space station, named Freedom, is scheduled to be in orbit in 1996. As of Jan. 11, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> was tracking 7,087 pieces of space junk, 3,142 put into orbit by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 3,302 left behind by Soviet spacecraft. Space junk has included items such as screws 1 @ 8-inch in diameter missing after a 1984 space shuttle mission, a thermal glove that floated out of Gemini 4 in 1965, and a screwdriver dropped by a spacewalking astronaut aboard the Soviet Mir space station. `` Even the smallest pieces of orbital debris pose a potential hazard'' to the space station, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said. `` It is important that the pressurized modules of Freedom be built to withstand as much orbital debris damage as possible.'' The station is planned to remain in <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> orbit for up to 30 years.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led his inaugural parade of floats, bands and military marchers up <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, walking for a time under bright sunshine along the route to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> he now calls home. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, emerged three times from their armor-plated limousine to walk along parts of the parade route from the Capitol to the mansion at 1600 <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> where they have a four-year lease. At one point, the first lady left her husband's side and rushed over to kiss television weatherman <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, who was broadcasting from the sidelines. The Bushes, followed by Vice President <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, and the <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s children, walked the final leg of the 1.6-mile parade route past the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> and into the presidential reviewing stand outside the White House. For nearly three hours, the president and his new vice-president sat with their families, <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> officers, <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices and other guests to review floats, bands, dance troupes and equestrian teams representing all 50 states. Darkness fell and bone-chilling cold set in before some 12,000 marchers, 70 floats and 457 horses had filed past the presidential reviewing stand. Most of the people who paid $ 100 a seat in bleachers nearest the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had left long before the parade ended. For the finale, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his guests stood to sing `` The Battle Hymn of the Republic'' with the <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tabernacle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Choir </ORGANIZATION>, which arrived on a white float bearing the slogan `` Peace, Prosperity and Independence.'' `` It's a grand day sir, and it's a grand old flag,'' conductor <PERSON> Jerold </PERSON> <PERSON> Ottley </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, whereupon choir members, sporting yellow plaid scarves, broke into a spirited version of `` It's a Grand Old Flag.'' Like any firemen's parade in towns across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inaugural procession had a stream of high school bands, flags, baton twirlers and antique cars But unlike most local parades, this one also had the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> State Marching Band, the Budweiser Clydesdales and the `` President's Own'' <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION> all in the same line. The two grand marshals, comedian <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> and test pilot <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeager </PERSON>, rode to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on the lead `` Flag Float'' and joined the Bushes in the front row of the reviewing stand. The president's son, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, donned a white ten-gallon hat when the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> float, followed by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Longhorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION>, arrived on the scene. The line of march also included a band from <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>, the president's alma mater, and another from <ORGANIZATION> DePauw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> college that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> attended Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s alma mater, <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION>, was represented by a marching band that boasted `` the world's largest drum.'' An obviously delighted president stood up and waved as a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> TBM Avenger torpedo bomber, a duplicate of the plane he piloted during World War II, went by on a float. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> shared a joke as the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrolmen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the first police union to endorse the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential ticket last fall, filed by along with a large float representing <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s finest The endorsement was particularly embarrassing for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Democratic challenger from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. During the parade, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> dangled grandchildren on his knee, greeted Cabinet officers and chatted with his children. Across the aisle, the <ORGANIZATION> Quayles </ORGANIZATION> sat alone, speaking only infrequently with the Bushes or others on the platform. Arriving on the platform, Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> greeted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with a kiss, then quickly froze to attention after noticing that a color guard was passing by. Each time a flag appeared, Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> stood up and placed her hand over her heart.

 Democratic lawmakers welcomed <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inaugural speech as a sign that the new Republican president will have better relations with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> than <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did, but they also said it offered too few specifics `` I think we're off on a good foot,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, D-Mich. `` This has genuinely established a kind of bipartisanship and friendship that should go beyond inaugural speeches. `` I've been very touched by the things he's said in the last several days,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, D-Ga. `` It's better than what we've had in the past eight years. `` It was a very sensitive speech,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, D-Kan. `` In style, it's a dramatic break from <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> It was humane, and it showed a recognition that the Democrats control both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s suggestion in his 20-minute address that the federal government's money needs be reallocated clearly implied a shift from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s emphasis on military spending to domestic priorities. `` He repeated the themes he's been stating since the election: cooperation and conciliation,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash. `` It is all very well received, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will respond with an equal effort and attitude. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is extending the hand of friendship, and we intend to extend ours in return,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said he planned to make a speech in response on Wednesday, when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> reconvenes, `` setting forth some of our objectives for this Congress.'' He said he had discussed his plans for the response with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said the speech represented `` a good start,'' but added: `` Now the hard part comes _ doing all these things the president wants to do. Former House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, D-Mass., also welcomed the change `` It's the dawn of a new era,'' he said. `` We're back to normalcy in the White House. How delighted I am.'' Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, praised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s address and predicted he will be a different type of president than <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` He remembered the real problems, like the deficit and drugs,'' <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, you can tell by the way he talks, will be a hands-on president. Rather than trying to dismantle the bureaucracy, he'll try to make it work.'' Some lawmakers said that while they welcomed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s heavy emphasis on volunteerism to meet the country's social needs, they were concerned that it might indicate an intent not to put federal money into programs like housing and welfare. `` I just do n't understand how he's going to have <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> be more generous and not spend any more money on the people who need help,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION> `` Be happy, do n't worry _ that's what we heard today.

 A fireball that blazed across the night skies of the central <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Friday was a Soviet rocket body launched in December and re-entering the atmosphere, authorities said. The rocket was sighted in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and a number of witnesses called officials to say they had seen it blaze across the sky about 8:10 p.m. CST. Some witnesses said the fireball had fiery tail 30 to 40 miles long. Maj. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Space Command identified the object as a Soviet-built rocket body that was launched sometime last year. `` It came down about 9 p.m. EST,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. `` There is no way to know as to what happened to it.'' The space command tracks about 7,100 manmade objects and once they start to notice an object falling out of orbit they try to predict its re-entry, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said the object would not be positively identified until Saturday. Earlier in the evening, before the rocket body was tentatively identified, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> Dugald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillies </PERSON>, deputy director of public affairs for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Space Command, said the Space Surveillance Center was monitoring the object. `` We've gotten many calls as well,'' <PERSON> Gillies </PERSON> said. `` To the best of our estimation, it would be a re-entering of a Soviet rocket body from a launch that took place last year. `` -LRB- That's -RRB- as much detail as we have. -LRB- It was -RRB- one of the objects that we track. This re-entry correlates with what we were tracking.'' He said the sightings were made better because of weather that was clear and perfect for such sightings. A dispatcher at the <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> said the office had received calls from `` all over the state.'' `` Altus, <PERSON> Enid </PERSON>, Pawnee, <LOCATION> Muskogee </LOCATION> ... you name it, they've seen it,'' she said. `` We're not sure yet what it was.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and military bureaus and bases across the midwest and southwest were swamped with calls from the curious, officials said. `` It just appeared all of a sudden out of the south and fell straight due north and it left a line just as straight as could be,'' <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> England </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Abilene </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reporter-News </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> said the rocket was in the sky for about three minutes, slowly streaking across the sky. Sgt. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenzini </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, division of the <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>, said the display was spectacular. `` I went to the front door about 8:10 p.m. and saw what looked like a cluster of five pieces of some kind of burning debris in the sky,'' <PERSON> Lenzini </PERSON> said. `` It had the effect of Fourth of July, or Roman candles trailing fire behind it,'' he said.

The information they are giving me is that he is giving them verifiable hard facts concerning unsolved murders.'' <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> would not identify the officers who spoke to him, but said <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> met Friday with <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Keppel </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state attorney general's office, and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagmaier </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Behavioral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Quantico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, who faces execution Tuesday in the slaying of a 12-year-old <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> girl, is scheduled to meet this weekend with authorities from <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> and his wife met with the killer for about two hours Friday morning before the law enforcement meetings began. Police have mentioned <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> as a suspect in as many as three dozen slayings in the early and mid-1970s in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. The victims were young women between the ages of 16 and 26. Many were never found. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> has frequently met with investigators and reporters over the past 11 years, but has refused to talk specifically about any of the cases. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, facing the electric chair for the 1978 murder of <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, has tried to trade information about the unsolved murders for a delay in his execution, but Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> rejected the offer. <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> has been meeting regularly with <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> for about two years. He said the killer told him about a year ago that he wanted to confess to everything he'd done. <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>, a defense attorney before being elected in November, said they specifically did not discuss details of any of the cases because he is a lawyer. `` I know people wo n't necessarily accept this, but -LRB- <LOCATION> Bundy </LOCATION> -RRB- says it's the right thing to do,'' the attorney said. `` People think he's just trying to buy time.

 Condemned murderer <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> began confessing to the murders of about 30 young women in five Western states Friday, a newspaper reported, and the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Supreme </LOCATION> refused to block his execution. The 42-year-old former law student is slated to die in the electric chair Tuesday for the murder of a 12-year-old <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> girl. Volusia State Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>, a personal friend of Bundy, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orlando </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sentinel </ORGANIZATION> Friday night that he learned of the confessions from law enforcement agents at <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Starke </LOCATION>, the newspaper said Saturday. `` It's my information that murders are being solved,'' <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> said. `` This is coming from law enforcement officers who are participating in these meetings.

Defense attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> was expected to take his appeal to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> for a hearing on Saturday morning. The high court rejected three claims from <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> and said his attempt to again raise the issue of mental competency constituted an abuse of process. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said the issue had not been raised in a timely fashion, should have been raised at an earlier stage and had already been settled in an case in which <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was convicted of murdering two sorority sisters. The court also said no petition for rehearing will be permitted. `` The question really was, was he able to assist his lawyers?'' said <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, who sought to stop the execution to determine whether <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was competent during his trial for the murder of <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> schoolgirl. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> served as his own attorney through much of that trial. `` Much of what he did, even at the hearing, undermined his defense and his lawyers were having problems controlling him, getting him to make decisions, having problems getting him to stick to decisions,'' said <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>. Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> said after the hearing that <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s attorneys were `` grasping at a straw.'' `` All the courts have found <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> to be competent,'' said <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON>. The appeal centered on allegations that <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s competence to stand trial was n't adequately reviewed in either the <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> case or an earlier conviction in the 1978 slayings of sorority sisters at <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. They also claimed the judge at the <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> trial improperly discussed the case with prosecutors without defense attorneys present. Those claims were rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which said they were not raised in timely fashion in accordance with rules of procedure. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> is under his fourth death warrant. Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> signed the most recent warrant Tuesday after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> declined to hear the case. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s last stay of execution was in 1986, six hours before he was to go to the electric chair.

 A homeless man `` cold-bloodedly'' chased and shot two policemen to death Friday before he was killed by other officers in a noontime gun battle recorded by a student television crew. The man, a transient, grabbed the gun of an officer questioning him outside a doughnut shop, then chased the officer and opened fire, wounding him and then fatally shooting him in the head, police and witnesses said. The homeless man then mortally wounded a second officer before other police officers arrived and killed him in a fusillade of pistol and shotgun fire, witnesses and police officials reported. Police said there were 30 witnesses to the incident, which was at least partly recorded by a student television crew from <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> that was making a film about the homeless across the street from the shooting. The videotape they shot is jumpy and incomplete, but apparently shows the transient firing at the wounded officers, then running across the street while still holding the gun. A moment later, he is shown lying in the street. The second officer died about six hours after the shooting, after undergoing three hours of surgery at the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, doctors said. Coroners officials in this city, about 40 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, withheld the officers' names until their families could be notified. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> was driving through the area when he saw a man pointing a gun at the officer. `` He began pursuing the officer. The officer hit the ground. He -LRB- the transient -RRB- cold-bloodedly pursued him,'' said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>. `` I saw the officer disappear behind a truck. I saw the man lower his gun and shoot.'' The 3 -LCB- - minute audio track of the tape carries the sound of 26 shots, 21 of them during the final 30-second volley that killed the transient The shooting came three days after another drifter, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>, opened fire in an elementary school playground in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, 80 miles to the east, killing five children and wounded 30 other people before taking his own life.

 Fires set by inmates erupted Friday night in a prison south of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and authorities said an unknown number of inmates were free within the sprawling complex. One inmate was killed and one was injured, authorities said. At least four fires were set in the <LOCATION> Lorton </LOCATION> Reformatory complex, according to authorities. The administration building of the central facility was destroyed by the flames, according to officials at the mayor's command center. District of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, accompanied by his wife <PERSON> Effi </PERSON>, both dressed in formal clothes they wore to Friday night's inaugural balls, arrived early today for a briefing The fires were at the corrections complex, which is operated by the district and located about 20 miles south of the city. The medium-security complex houses about 1,280 inmates from the district in dormitories and has been the scene of numerous inmate protests because of overcrowded conditions. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the city corrections department, said one inmate was killed in the outbreak and another was injured. No details about the circumstances of those casualties were immediately available. Ms. <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> said all inmates had been accounted for and none had escaped from the complex. Firefighters remained outside for about an hour while city corrections officers herded inmates who had been loose in the complex onto a baseball field. Lt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said firemen did not try to put out the fires until it was certain the situation was safe. `` Until we get an area that is confirmed secure, we are keeping our firefighters out,'' he said. It was not clear how many buildings were on fire in the sprawling complex, which sits in a wooded, rolling area near the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. One official said four buildings had fires, but there were other reports that only two buildings were aflame. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> police were rushed to the area, including officers who had been assigned to protection duties at inaugural balls around the city. The galas were celebrating the inauguration of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> earlier Friday. The fire did not disrupt <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s schedule as he made the rounds of inaugural events, but six police cars, their sirens wailing, sped by on their way to the prison just as the president's motorcade pulled up to a private dinner at the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> building near the White House. The incident began with a power failure about 9:15 p.m. at the prison's central facility. With the lights out, fires were set by inmates in the building, said Ms. <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>. `` We have no idea what specifically is going on inside'' the central facility, she said in answer to a question about the location of inmates. Inmates were herded into a nearby baseball field where they were being guarded by police, Ms. <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> said. The fires continued to burn several hours after the first alarm was sounded. Early today, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> fire units arrived to aid <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> firefighters. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents also went to the prison, said Ms. <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigates crimes at the complex. A district police helicopter hovered overhead and some inmates were running loose in an open area within the prison complex. The chronically overcrowded prison complex, made up of a series of smaller prisons, held a total of 6,165 inmates last month, when the district government asked a federal judge to bar newly sentenced felons from the entering city institutions. The city closed its doors to new inmates for six weeks last fall, opening them again only under a federal judge's order. The federal government was forced to take charge of 300 city inmates during that time. The district has also sent more than 200 inmates to the states of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Parris </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., responding to the violence and frequent escapes from the facility, introduced legislation in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last fall to give <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> some control over the prison complex At the time, he said, `` The situation at <LOCATION> Lorton </LOCATION> reached crisis proportions a decade ago, and it has continued to deteriorate.'' Although there have been isolated incidents at the complex, Friday night's outbreak was the largest since an inmate riot broke out in July, 1986 at the Occoquan I and II facilities, two sections within the <LOCATION> Lorton </LOCATION> institution. One inmate was killed by buckshot wounds to the head suffered when guards tried to quell the uprising. Twenty-nine inmates, nine guards and three firefighters were injured in that riot. The fiery outbreak damaged 13 buildings and many inmates were kept in temporary shelters for a time afterwards. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Koren </PERSON>, an attorney with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` This is not anything new, we have a long, sad history of overcrowding at these facilities. Inevitably, there are disturbances.'' `` It's really a very dangerous place. They claim it is medium security, but really its used for long timers. It's really just a dormitory. There's a lot of violence, a lot of idlness, conditions are poor, and that's a real dangerous mix.'' The district has been unable to build new facilities at the complex because of political opposition from <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials, who oppose the presence of the district prison and hold more power than the city in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Bush Says He's `a Lousy Dancer' but He Takes a Whirl Anyway</HEAD>

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called himself `` a lousy dancer'' but gamely took a few whirls with his wife during an exultant tour of inaugural balls where 60,000 Republican stalwarts toasted his swearing-in and caroused into the wee hours today. During the gaudy, noisy and slightly wacky evening, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also bragged about his `` fantastic'' new living quarters at the White House and Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had one hotel ballroom throng erupting in laughter with an offhand remark with a double meaning. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice for secretary of state, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, sashayed with fellow Texans beneath the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> brothers' plane at the National Air and Space Museum, where <PERSON> Crystal </PERSON> <PERSON> Gayle </PERSON> sang her country best. It was so crowded and the air so heavy in the red-carpeted grand foyer of the Kennedy Center that several black-tie guests fainted in front of the stage. One woman who lost consciousness was kept from sagging to the floor by the crush of more than 5,000 people around her. Presidential son <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> introduced his wife, who wore a full-length blue velvet gown, and told several thousand partygoers at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Convention Center: `` I paid a lot for this dress and, damn it, I wanted you to see it.'' One of the belles of the ball at another hotel was 7-year-old <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Cartonia </PERSON>, the current <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION>. Her mother, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, proudly confided that <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> was conceived in the same hotel during President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first inauguration in 1981, when `` we thought we were never going to have children.'' Outside one of the 11 invitation-only inaugural balls, animal rights protesters shouted `` Fur is Murder'' and `` I'm Warm _ I'm Not Wearing Fur'' at arriving guests, many of whom wore fur coats in the chill wind. The bass player for the Bus Boys rock band at a $ 30-a-head youth ball stood up and shouted: `` It's the inaugural day for a brand-new, get-down president.'' During his hurried ball-hopping tour from Union Station near the Capitol to the Kennedy Center on the banks of the moonlit <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, the new president made it laughingly clear that he's not very fond of dancing. Each time the band struck up `` I Could Have Danced All Night,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, out for a brief cheek-to-cheek turn on the floor. He took a few steps of an old-fashioned fox trot _ and no more. He told the crowd at Union Station that `` you can say that you saw it first here: a lousy dancer trying to dance his first dance with the first lady of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Later, at the sprawling Pension Building, he quipped, `` The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> family is going to give dancing a bad name.'' After taking a few steps with Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, he stopped abruptly and announced: `` That's it That's the only step I know.'' At the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Convention Center, which rocked to the music of his old friend <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>, the president pleaded with the crowd to overlook his footwork. `` I hope you do n't judge my being a president by the way I dance,'' he said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told revelers at a hotel ballroom that he feels the same way about dancing as his new boss. `` I guess protocol allows you to witness my inability to dance,'' he said, taking his wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, onto the floor for a few stiff turns. At another hotel, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> appeared with his wife and, recalling their departure from the oath-taking ceremony at the Capitol, remarked that `` we went behind the Bushes.'' The crowd erupted in laughter at the double-entendre. `` <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> could not do it better,'' the vice president said with a grin. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seemed elated by his new home at 1600 <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>. `` Do n't worry about our housing,'' he told one ballroom assembly. `` We were over at the White House for two hours and, boy, is it something special. Unbelievable.'' At his first stop, an American Legion affair for 149 Medal of Honor winners and other military heroes, the president vowed to keep <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> strong. By the time he reached the <LOCATION> Omni </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> for his 12th visit, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s energy was flagging. `` Where do you get all that life from?'' he asked the cheering throng. At his 15th and final stop on the party circuit, standing in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Hilton Hotel ballroom at 12:30 a.m., a hoarse <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seemed in a reflective mood as he recalled his emotions when he took the oath of office at the West Front of the Capitol at midday Friday. `` I did feel moved standing there today and looking across that sea of faces,'' he said, `` thinking of the continuity of the presidency, thinking of my gratitude to my predecessor, thinking of the joy that I have and the strength that I get from my family, thinking of how lucky we are to be a nation under <PERSON> God </PERSON> and thinking how lucky I am to have friends like you.'' With that, he departed in his limousine. Fifteen minutes later, he arrived home for his first night in the White House.

 World leaders showered President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with congratulations as he took office, with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> hoping he would bring peace and Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> wishing him `` an abundance of divine blessings.'' The leftist Nicaraguan government extended an olive branch and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders were optimistic that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would move the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s staunch pro-Israeli position in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. One European newspaper hailed the return of pragmatists to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government and another `` the down-to-earth <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'' over `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> the romantic.'' A British daily said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would need some of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s luck. While the sendoffs for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> were mostly warm, about 5,000 Panamanians shot off fireworks in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and Nicaraguans danced in the streets of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> to celebrate his departure. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> he hoped his term would bring `` stable and diverse development of relations between our countries,'' and said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was ready to work in that direction, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said, `` Further joint efforts by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will make it possible to substantially bring closer the solution of the most painful problems of the present time, above all, the need to eliminate the threat of war.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> sent <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a congratulatory message, as did West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and other European leaders. In <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the pope, leader of the world's Roman Catholics, wished <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` an abundance of divine blessings.'' Also among the well-wishers were King <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and presidents <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> de Gortari of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Panamanians, led by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, celebrated <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s departure by shooting off fireworks and dancing to bands in a plaza on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s main thoroughfare. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> denies <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug charges against him and has outlasted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to force him to quit as the nation's de facto leader. In <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sandinistas </PERSON> celebrated the end of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> era with dancing in the streets and parades that mocked him. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s administration has financed the anti-government <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels since 1981 One float Friday showed Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> throwing dollars and the local opposition picking them up. However, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON>, saying he was optimistic U.S.-Nicaraguan `` relations will improve'' under <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, announced that it would begin issuing visas for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> imposed visa restrictions after each country expelled eight of the other's diplomats, including the ambassadors, during a diplomatic tiff in July. In the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> commentators appeared to agree that the changeover from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s loss and the Arabs' gain. In <LOCATION> Jeruslaem </LOCATION>, the daily <ORGANIZATION> Hadashot </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> must be prepared for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` to be less sensitive and more pragmatic in approaching the -LRB- Arab-Israel -RRB- conflict.'' President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> said he believed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` understands the Palestinian problem and has good intentions,'' according to an interview with the <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> daily Al-Rai Al-Aam. <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, and other officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> expressed cautious optimism that their cause may fare better with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` The pros are back,'' said the conservative <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Libre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belgique </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, but added they were `` a network of serious patricians who risk being boring.'' In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, the leftist newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monde </ORGANIZATION> asked: `` After ` the Great Communicator,' ` the Great Corrector?''' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` big challenge will be peace, of which Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> made himself the champion,'' the paper said. The center-left <ORGANIZATION> Het </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parool </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidency will be less flamboyant than that of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` But better than <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> the romantic, the down-to-earth <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may be expected to draw the line between dream and reality. And that holds no small promise.'' The Financial Times anticipated `` a preference for management and a recognition of interdependence,'' but added <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would need luck _ `` a commodity that Mr. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had in abundance but can not bequeath.''

 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> danced gamely into his second day on the job, partying with wife <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> until well past midnight and facing down a heckler in the only moment of discord on a night of celebration. The Quayles stopped at 14 inaugural balls and parties over more than four and a half hours Friday night after being sworn in as the 44th vice president. It was after 1 a.m. before they headed to the vice president's residence for their first night's sleep in their new home. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legion </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Salute to Heroes' Banquet,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was interrupted by a shout from the audience just as he was speaking of freedom as `` the most precious thing we have.'' `` What do you know about it?'' shouted a woman who appeared to be a guest but could not be identified. Pausing only briefly, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said: `` Freedom, people have the freedom to speak. We have free speech in this country.'' He received a long and loud applause from the crowd made up largely of war veterans, including 149 of the 225 living recipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor, the nation's highest military honor. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> savored the sound of his new title at several stops. After praising <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at length, he said, `` As a matter of fact, Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> does n't sound too shabby.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> danced with his wife briefly at each of the balls on their motorcade tour of the city. He told reporters before stepping out for the evening that his wife says he is a `` terrible dancer,'' and he pledged `` to keep it to a minimum.'' He did little to dispel that judgment, and the dances were brief. At the lavish ball in newly restored Union Station he danced with his mother, and at several other stops he and <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> danced with guests selected from the audience _ after first dancing with each other. But as the night wore on both appeared weary, and by midnight he had lost track of how many parties they had been to. `` Ask the press,'' said <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. He did. `` The press says it's the 11th ball,'' the vice president announced. `` They're usually wrong _ so for the record, it's either 10 or 12.'' He won more applause. At a stop at the youth inaugural ball, the 41-year-old <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was greeted warmly. One woman on the front row, 24-year-old <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, yelled to him, `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, blow me a kiss,'' and, `` Take your coat off, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>.'' At another stop he told of his unease at the new protocol that put him ahead of former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> upon leaving the inaugural ceremony. He said he and <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> `` went out behind the Bushes,'' and then paused to consider what he'd said. Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> put her hand to her face in embarrassment. The crowd roared. `` <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> could do no better,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said finally. With that, it was time to dance.

But <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> maintained he shouted questions only when there was no other way to get an answer.

<HEAD>Iran Institutes Mandatory Death Penalty For Smugglers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A tough Iranian crackdown on drug traffickers takes effect today, with a mandatory death penalty for anyone found with small amounts of narcotics. At least 75 smugglers already have been executed this month in the fiercest crackdown since the early days of the Islamic revolution, when hundreds of alleged drug users and pushers were rounded up and killed. The new campaign followed the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war and an alarming surge in drug abuse blamed on hardships caused by the 8-year conflict, worsening unemployment and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s religious ban on alcohol. The laws mandate death for people convicted of possessing 30 grams, or just over an ounce, of heroin, codeine or morphine or smuggling 11 pounds of opium or hashish. Simple possession of opium or hashish carries a jail term. `` We have no fear of increasing statistics on executions because those who become the victims of the traders of death are far greater in number than the smugglers,'' said <PERSON> Mohammad-Mousavi </PERSON> <PERSON> Khoeiniha </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s prosecutor-general, on <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio. Official figures on drug abuse in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> are not available. But Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> recently indicated the scale of the crisis by referring to `` the devastating problem of drug abuse ... a blight that has ruined some of our young people.'' `` The problem ... is a political one,'' said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s chief justice, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ardebili </PERSON>. `` The superpowers, just as they fought the Islamic revolution on the battlefield and in the economic field ... use narcotics as one method to battle with the people ... and taint the revolution.'' Even before the new law came into force, Iranian authorities had rounded up more than 1,000 suspected smugglers and pushers, running them through Islamic tribunals and hanging them as soon as they were found guilty. On Jan. 7, 19 smugglers were hanged or shot by firing squads. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s radical <ORGANIZATION> Jomhuri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islami </ORGANIZATION> daily hailed the executions as `` a landmark on the path to eradicating narcotics.'' Nine days later, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official media said 56 were executed in one day in various cities, a chilling display of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s determination to eliminate drugs <PERSON> Jomhuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Islami </PERSON> urged that authorities `` put an end to the disgraceful life of a few who take joy in ruining a nation only to fill their pockets. `` It's much better if some families lose their breadwinners in this way than a nation loses its youth.'' The new law was announced Dec. 5 by the 13-member Expediency Council, a body with special powers set up in February by <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> to speed legislation snarled in Parliament. Apart from the death sentences, the law provides for a minimum 20-year prison term for anyone convicted of addicting another person to drugs. Those convicted of causing widespread addiction could also face death. The Expediency Council gave drug addicts six months to kick their habits or face imprisonment. <PERSON> Mokhtar </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalantari </PERSON>, deputy commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Committees, which have largely taken over law enforcement from police, acknowledged shortcomings in recent years in combatting the narcotics trade from neighboring <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> while <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> concentrated on the war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. There are extensive poppy fields in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> as well. Officials say large quantities of narcotics are smuggled through <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Former President <PERSON> Abolhassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bani-Sadr </PERSON>, in exile in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, claimed in a recent <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> interview that the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> government is involved in the drug trade `` to make ends meet,'' earning $ 2 billion a year from it. <PERSON> Kalantari </PERSON> predicted with the new laws that authorities will eliminate 80 percent of the narcotics trade within two years.

 Mayor <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> unveiled an economic development plan for poor black neighborhoods in the wake of riots as the city geared up for the Super Bowl with fanfare, fireworks and fiestas. Law enforcement officials, meanwhile, prepared for the funeral today of one of two black men whose deaths in a police shooting Monday triggered the riots. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> discussed the plan in a meeting Friday with black leaders as the black neighborhoods shaken by three days of violence returned to normality. `` We know that a little bit of anger can have good results, and we hope to turn what was more than a little bit of anger expressed in our community into many, many good results,'' he told them. The city refused to let one of its worst weeks completely spoil the prelude to one of its biggest events: the Super Bowl this Sunday. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>, <PERSON> Liza </PERSON> <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> performed Friday night at the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arena </LOCATION> on the edge of <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION>, the predominantly black neighborhood where the riots began. Another performance was booked for tonight. In nearby <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, 3,000 people attended a bash held by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rozelle </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Stephen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Muss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Fireworks burst over <LOCATION> Biscayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> as thousands of excited partiers listened to salsa and jazz bands at a shopping center and park less than a mile from where the shooting occurred. A panel formed to investigate the shooting met for the first time Friday. `` I'm hoping we'll begin to deal seriously with this community's problems and do more than just put some iodine on its cancers,'' said the Rev <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>, chairman of the 11-member committee of police officers and black residents. An unarmed motorcyclist, 23-year-old <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, was shot in the head by a Hispanic policeman Monday as he sped through <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>'s passenger, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, died of injuries from the subsequent crash. The rioting that followed left one man dead, and 11 others were treated for gunshot wounds. Thirteen buildings were torched, others were looted and 372 people were arrested in <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> and the predominantly black <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> neighborhood, authorities said. About 150 of those arrested remained in jail, unable to post bond, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazur </PERSON>. Authorities planned to keep them locked up until new arraignments Monday when, if they plead guilty, they will released based on time served. <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> was to be buried this afternoon. Officials said they were concerned about the potential for trouble at the funeral, primarily because of the involvement of the Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>, who has led protests by blacks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` The major concern is that <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> will cause problems,'' said <PERSON> Mazur </PERSON>. `` We do n't need someone pouring gasoline on the situation.'' Black leaders have said <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> is unwelcome, but he was scheduled to hold a news conference and rally anyway. Security concerns also focused on the Super Bowl. Three hundred <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> police officers in uniform and plainclothes will guard <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Stadium </PERSON>, said police spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>. Only people with tickets will be allowed past the parking gates. If protesters show up and obstruct the entrance, they will be moved out quickly, <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> called his program `` <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s comeback plan,'' aimed at giving an economic boost to black areas and improving police-community relations. The plan includes special tax districts, business and job creation programs and police sensitivity and screening efforts. He said that it was only a partial solution and some of the programs may fail. The mayor did not set a cost for his plan, nor did he say how it would be financed, but City Manager <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Odio </PERSON> said city resources for helping impoverished sections were slim. `` We're almost taxed out,'' <PERSON> Odio </PERSON> said. `` There's no more we can do with taxes.'' Black leaders gathered 200 residents and high school students at a community center for a previously scheduled workshop on non-violent conflict resolution and the teachings of the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. They said they hoped the session, at which <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> also appeared, would help calm tensions. <PERSON> Yolanda </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, daughter of the slain civil rights leader, said her father would not have advocated violence but would have been heartened that the needs of the community were receiving attention because of the unrest.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> is fighting a legal battle with <ORGANIZATION> Wampanoag </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> over a strip of beach on chic <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard that they consider sacred The Indians portray Mrs. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> as a rich newcomer intent on grabbing their tribal lands to round out her private summer retreat on the resort island off <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION>. But her <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> lawyer, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Forger </PERSON>, says the former first lady has tried to deal fairly with the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>, offering to swap better land or buy the beach for a fair price. The Indians, descendants of the island's original inhabitants, seem to be trying to take advantage of her wealth and the publicity her name can generate, he added. `` Because the interested party is Mrs. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>, it seems evident that they believe thay can obtain five times what the property is worth,'' Forger said Friday. Mrs. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>' real estate trust is suing for partition of the 1.5-acre stretch of pristine dunes, a legal maneuver that could result in the property being put up for sale to the highest bidder. A pretrial conference was held earlier this week at the <ORGANIZATION> Dukes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Probate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Edgartown </LOCATION>. The original motion was filed Aug. 12, 1980, but the lawsuit lay dormant for years. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sulla </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> lawyer representing about a dozen of the Indians, said little doubt exists about who the high bidder would be. `` Most of my clients have little or no money, and there is no way they can compete with <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON>,'' he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>' trust already has a one-seventh interest in the land. The remaining shares are owned by more than 25 <ORGANIZATION> Wampanoag </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> wants to buy out the Indians and gain sole ownership of the 264-foot-long stretch of beach because she owns all the land around it: a 400-acre tract that includes her summer home and guest house, <PERSON> Forger </PERSON> said. The property, in the town of <LOCATION> Gay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Head </LOCATION>, `` is rapidly being eroded by the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and is expected not to exist in another 10 years,'' he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> offered to swap a larger beachfront property that is not subject to erosion and has better access, but the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> declined, Forger said. <PERSON> Sulla </PERSON> said the Indians are willing to respect Mrs. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>' privacy but would like her to allow them to swim and pick wild berries on the beach as they have for generations `` <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON>'s property completely surrounds the Indians' land, and she has guards at both ends of her beach to keep everyone away,'' <PERSON> Sulla </PERSON> said. `` But this area is very sacred to the <ORGANIZATION> Wampanoags </ORGANIZATION>. This is where their great chief resides in legend. They say he smokes his pipe, and that's where the fog comes from.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>'s trust bought the 400 acres on <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard in the mid-1970s and has brought a series of court actions to try to clear title to the land. Titles in Gay Head are often unclear because the town was divided into a checkerboard pattern in the 1870s, and many lots have no legal access. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Patadal </PERSON>, a tribal member whose family has a small share in the land, said the property is the only piece of beach Indians still own in <LOCATION> Gay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Head </LOCATION>. Most of the Wampanoag tribal lands have gradually been lost or sold, and the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> intend to preserve what they've got left, she said `` Nobody wants to sell tickets for people to see <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON>,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Patadal </PERSON> said. `` We're not interested in that. We just want to be able to get to our beach.''

<TEXT>
 The foreign minister of <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> has had his knuckles rapped for what is usually considered an essential skill in modern diplomacy _ speaking English. Newspapers and politicians have harshly criticized <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Deus </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinheiro </PERSON> ever since he spoke English earlier this month at an international conference on chemical weapons in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Critics say it breaks a pledge by the seven Portuguese-speaking nations to promote their language _ the sixth most widely spoken in the world _ at international events. More importantly, they charge <PERSON> Pinheiro </PERSON> hurt <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> at a time when its influence among former colonies is increasingly being challenged by one of them _ <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. `` No speak Portuguese,'' was the motto plastered across the T-shirt of a cartoon of <PERSON> Deus </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinheiro </PERSON> on the cover of the satirical, right-wing weekly <PERSON> O </PERSON> <PERSON> Diabo </PERSON>. Another paper this week showed the stocky, bearded minister introducing himself as `` God Pine'' _ the direct English translation of his name. While <PERSON> Deus </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinheiro </PERSON> has been busy drumming up international financial support for an economic recovery plan for the other major Portuguese-speaking countries of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> has outflanked <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> on trade and relief efforts. Trade between <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> has quadrupled the last three years to more than $ 1 billion. <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s trade with <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> dropped from about $ 165 million in 1986 to $ 127 million in 1987. For the first eight months of 1988, the countries' did about $ 103 million in business. <PERSON> Deus </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinheiro </PERSON>'s recovery plan foresees $ 600 million dollars worth of aid from several nations to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> has already granted <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION> a $ 1.1 billion credit that the African nation repays in oil it produces.

Brazilian companies are now showing interest in helping rebuild <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s ravaged telephone and power networks. `` We think <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> made an error -LRB- at the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> conference -RRB-,'' said <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s secretary of state for foreign affairs, <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Materrula </PERSON>. `` We have to push our mutual language at an international level.''

<TEXT>
 Here is a transcript of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inaugural address as delivered on Friday Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. President, Vice President <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, Senator <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, Speaker <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, Senator <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, Congressman <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, and fellow citizens, neighbors and friends. There is a man here who has earned a lasting place in our hearts _ and in our history. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, on behalf of our nation, I thank you for the wonderful things that you have done for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. I have just repeated word-for-word the oath taken by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> 200 years ago; and the Bible on which I placed my hand is the Bible on which he placed his. It is right that the memory of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> be with us today, not only because this is our bicentennial inauguration, but because <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> remains the father of our country. And, he would, I think, be gladdened by this day. For today is the concrete expression of a stunning fact: Our continuity these 200 years since our government began. We meet on democracy's front porch. A good place to talk as neighbors, and as friends. For this is a day when our nation is made whole, when our differences, for a moment, are suspended. And, my first act as president is a prayer. I ask you to bow your heads: `` Heavenly Father, we bow our heads and thank You for your love. Accept our thanks for the peace that yields this day and the shared faith that makes its continuance likely. Make us strong to do Your work, willing to heed and hear Your will, and write on our hearts these words: ` Use power to help people.' For we are given power not to advance our own purposes, nor to make a great show in the world, nor a name. There is but one just use of power, and it is to serve people. Help us remember, Lord. Amen.'' I come before you and assume the presidency at a moment rich with promise. We live in a peaceful, prosperous time, but we can make it better. For a new breeze is blowing, and a world refreshed by freedom seems reborn; for in man's heart, if not in fact, the day of the dictator is over. The totalitarian era is passing, its old ideas blown away like leaves from an ancient lifeless tree. A new breeze is blowing _ and a nation refreshed by freedom stands ready to push on: there is new ground to be broken, and new action to be taken. There are times when the future seems thick as a fog; you sit and wait, hoping the mists will lift and reveal the right path. But this is a time when the future seems a door you can walk right through _ into a room called Tomorrow. Great nations of the world are moving toward democracy _ through the door to freedom. Men and women of the world move toward free markets _ through the door to prosperity. The people of the world agitate for free expression and free thought _ through the door to the moral and intellectual satisfactions that only liberty allows. We know what works: Freedom works. We know what's right: Freedom is right. We know how to secure a more just and prosperous life for man on earth: through free markets, free speech, free elections, and the exercise of free will unhampered by the state. For the first time in this century _ for the first time in perhaps all history _ man does not have to invent a system by which to live. We do n't have to talk late into the night about which form of government is better. We do n't have to wrest justice from the kings _ we only have to summon it from within ourselves.

<TEXT>
 We must act on what we know. I take as my guide the hope of a saint in crucial things _ unity; in important things _ diversity, in all things, generosity. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> today is a proud, free nation, decent and civil _ a place we can not help but love. We know in our hearts, not loudly and proudly, but as a simple fact, that this country has meaning beyond what we see, and that our strength is a force for good. But have we changed as nation, even in our time? Are we enthralled with material things, less appreciative of the nobility of work and sacrifice? My friends, we are not the sum of our possessions. They are not the measure of our lives. In our hearts we know what matters. We can not hope only to leave our children a bigger car, a bigger bank account. We must hope to give them a sense of what it means to be a loyal friend, a loving parent, a citizen who leaves his home, his neighborhood and town better than he found it. And what do we want the men and women who work with us to say when we're no longer there? That we were more driven to succeed than anyone around us? Or that we stopped to ask if a sick child had gotten better and stayed a moment there to trade a word of friendship. No president, no government, can teach us to remember what is best in what we are. But if the man you have chosen to lead this government can help make a difference; if he can celebrate the quieter, deeper successes that are made not of gold and silk, but of better hearts and finer souls; if he can do these things, then he must. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is never wholly herself unless she is engaged in high moral principle. We as a people have such a purpose today. It is to make kinder the face of the nation and gentler the face of the world. My friends, we have work to do. There are the homeless, lost and roaming _ there are the children who have nothing, no love, no normalcy _ there are those who can not free themselves of enslavement to whatever addiction _ drugs, welfare, demoralization that rules the slums. There is crime to be conquered, the rough crime of the streets. There are young women to be helped who are about to become mothers of children they ca n't care for and might not love. They need our care, our guidance, and education; though we bless them for choosing life. The old solution, the old way, was to think that public money alone could end these problems. But we have learned that that is not so. And in any case, our funds are low. We have a deficit to bring down. We have more will than wallet; but will is what we need. We will make the hard choices, looking at what we have, perhaps allocating it differently, making our decisions based on honest need and prudent safety. And then we will do the wisest thing of all: we will turn to the only resource we have that in times of need always grows: the goodness and the courage of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.

 And, I am speaking of a new engagement in the lives of others _ a new activism, hands-on and involved, that gets the job done. We must bring in the generations, harnessing the unused talent of the elderly and the unfocused energy of the young. For not only leadership is passed from generation to generation, but so is stewardship. And the generation born after the Second World War has come of age. I have spoken of a `` thousand points of light' ` _ of all the community organizations that are spread like stars throughout the nation, doing good. We will work hand in hand, encouraging, sometimes leading, sometimes being led, rewarding. We will work on this in the White House, in the Cabinet agencies. I will go to the people and the programs that are the brighter points of light, and I'll ask every member of my government to become involved. The old ideas are new again because they're not old, they are timeless: duty, sacrifice, commitment, and a patriotism that finds its expression in taking part and pitching in. And we need a new engagement, too, between the executive and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The challenges before us will be thrashed out with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. And we must bring the federal budget into balance. And we must ensure that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> stands before the world united: strong, at peace, and fiscally sound. But, of course, things may be difficult. We need compromise; we have had dissension. We need harmony; we have had a chorus of discordant voices. For <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, too, has changed in our time. There has grown a certain divisiveness. We have seen the hard looks and heard the statements in which not each others' ideas are challenged, but each others' motives. And our great parties have two often been far apart and untrusting of each other. It's been this way since <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. That war cleaves us still. But, friends, that war began in earnest a quarter of a century ago; and, surely, the Statute of Limitations has been reached. This is a fact: The final lesson of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is that no great nation can long afford to be sundered by a memory. A new breeze is blowing _ and the old bipartisanship must be made new again. To my friends _ and yes, I do mean friends _ in the loyal opposition _ and, yes, I mean loyal: I put out my hand. I am putting out my hand to you, Mr. <PERSON> Speaker </PERSON>. I am putting out my hand to you, Mr. Majority Leader. For this is the thing: this is the age of the offered hand. And we ca n't turn back clocks, and I do n't want to. But when our fathers were young, Mr. <PERSON> Speaker </PERSON>, our differences ended at the water's edge. And we do n't wish to turn back time. But when our mothers were young, Mr. Majority Leader, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the executive were capable of working together to produce a budget on which this nation could live.

 Let us negotiate soon _ and hard. But in the end, let us produce. The American people await action. They did n't send us here to bicker. They ask us to rise above the merely partisan. `` In crucial things, unity'' _ and this, my friends, is crucial. To the world, too, we offer new engagement and a renewed vow: We will stay strong to protect the peace. The `` offered hand'' is a reluctant fist; once made, strong and can be used with great effect. There are today Americans who are held against their will in foreign lands, and Americans who are unaccounted for. Assistance can be shown here, and will be long remembered. Good will begets good will. Good faith can be a spiral that endlessly moves on. `` Great nations like great men must keep their word.'' When <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> says something, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> means it, whether a treaty or an agreement or a vow made on marble steps. We will always try to speak clearly, for candor is a compliment. But subtlety, too, is good and has its place. While keeping our alliances and friendships around the world strong, ever strong, we will continue the new closeness with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, consistent both with our security and with progress. One might say that our new relationship in part reflects the triumph of hope and strength over experience. But hope is good. And so is strength. And vigilance. Here today are tens of thousands of our citizens who feel the understandable satisfaction of those who have taken part in democracy and seen their hopes fulfilled. But my thoughts have been turning the past few days to those who would be watching at home _ To an older fellow who will throw a salute by himself when the flag goes by, and the women who will tell her sons the words of the battle hymns. I do not mean this to be sentimental. I mean that on days like this, we remember that we are all part of a continuum, inescapably connected by the ties that bind _ Our children are watching in schools throughout our great land. And to them I say, thank you for watching democracy's big day. For democracy belongs to us all, and freedom is like a beautiful kite that can go higher and higher with the breeze ...

 And to all I say: No matter what your circumstances or where you are, you are part of this day, you are part of the life of our great nation. A president is neither prince nor pope, and I do n't seek `` a window on men's souls.'' In fact, I yearn for a greater tolerance, an easy-goingness about each other's attitudes and way of life. There are few clear areas in which we as a society must rise up united and express our intolerance. And the most obvious now is drugs. And when that first cocaine was smuggled in on a ship, it may as well have been a deadly bacteria, so much has it hurt the body, the soul of our country. And there is much to be done and to be said, but take my word for it: This scourge will stop. And so, there is much to do: and tomorrow the work begins. And I do not mistrust the future; I do not fear what is ahead. For our problems are large, but our heart is larger. Our challenges are great, but our will is greater. And if our flaws are endless, God's love is truly boundless. Some see leadership as high drama, and the sound of trumpets calling. And sometimes it is that. But I see history as a book with many pages _ and each day we fill a page with acts of hopefulness and meaning. The new breeze blows, a page turns, the story unfolds _ and so today a chapter begins: a small and stately story of unity, diversity and generosity _ shared, and written, together. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Two Police Officers, Transient Die In Shootout Filmed By Students</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A transient grabbed a policeman's gun, shot him to death and mortally wounded another officer before police killed the man in a 30-second fusillade as a terrified student television crew recorded the violence. The homeless man, identified as <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Connors </PERSON>, 35, was being questioned by Officer <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, 45, in front of a downtown doughnut shop when a scuffle broke out around noon Friday, police and witnesses said. Among the estimated 30 witnesses were <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students making a documentary on the homeless. As the videotape rolled, <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> grabbed <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>'s pistol, chased the 19-year police veteran and opened fire, wounding him and then fatally shooting him in the head, police and witnesses said. `` He began pursuing the officer. The officer hit the ground. He -LRB- the transient -RRB- cold-bloodedly pursued him,'' said <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, a witness who was driving through the area. `` I saw the officer disappear behind a truck. I saw the man lower his gun and shoot.'' The film crew and other bystanders ducked behind cars and into nearby businesses as shots rang out and a second patrolman, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, was mortally wounded. The students' videotape, though jumpy and incomplete, shows the transient firing at the wounded officers. A moment later, he is shown lying in the street. On the tape, a cacophony of voices can be heard as members of the film crew and their subjects try to figure out what happened. Gradually, as the sound of sirens grows louder in the background, they identify the gunman as a figure wearing a brown coat _ <PERSON> Connors </PERSON>. Although the tape is of poor quality, the man in the brown coat can be seen firing a final shot, then jogging across the street with the pistol in his hand. As the frequency of gunfire increases, a hysterical woman shouts, `` Stay down! Stay down!'' The next video image is of the gunman's motionless body in the street. Police later said <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> was dead at the scene. <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> underwent three hours of surgery at <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and received 50 units of blood, but doctors were unable to save the 17-year police veteran, authorities said. Among the witnesses was <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>, another homeless man who knew Connors only as <PERSON> Randy </PERSON>. He said said he thought something was wrong with <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> when he saw him earlier in the day. `` I talked to him earlier this morning and he was in a trance, in a daze,'' said <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> apparently approached <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> initially because the transient had been acting oddly. Witnesses said the homeless man had been waving his arms as if he were trying to direct traffic. Another witness, <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> `` just grabbed the cop's gun and the cop took off. The guy started shooting. ... He fired about three -LRB- shots -RRB- or more. The cop took off and then a minute later, there were a lot of cops _ a ton of cops were shooting.'' Other shootings of police involving transients have occurred across the nation in recent years. In one of the more highly publicized cases, a white <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police officer was killed last year by a mentally ill, black transient who grabbed his gun and shot him while a crowd watched and some witnesses allegedly shouted, `` Shoot, shoot!'' The transient was later killed by police.

<HEAD>Military Unlikely To Allow Elections Until 1990</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENIS D. GRAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The military government blamed lawlessness for delaying free elections, and official sources said balloting to end more than a quarter-century of one-party rule might not take place until 1990. `` We need peace and tranquility in the country. If there is no law and order, how can we have elections?'' said Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Khin </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyunt </PERSON>, ranked No. 2 in a military council that has ruled <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> since it seized power Sept. 18 and brutally put down a nationwide uprising. The general did not specify Friday what disorder the nation was experiencing, and there has been no known resurgence of violent protest since the government, by its count, killed 500 people after the takeover. Western diplomats say about 1,000 were killed and dispute the government's claim that most of those killed were looters and `` destructive elements'' _ not pro-democracy demonstrators. <PERSON> Khin </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyunt </PERSON> told a news conference the government would keep schools closed, maintain a curfew and continue restrictions on opposition parties being mentioned in the state controlled media. `` Further opening will come slowly,'' he said. He repeatedly denied the government had arrested, tortured or executed student activists who had returned from border areas after fleeing the military repression. The London-based human rights group <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> claimed earlier this month that students returning from the Thai-Burmese border had been arrested. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it had `` credible reports'' that some returnees had been executed. <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> says about 2,000 students and others who participated in pro-democracy demonstrations last year have returned home, among them 320 repatriated under a Thai government-sponsored program. Shunned by the international community, including former aid donors <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the military has attempted to improve its tarnished rights image. The news conference came at the end of a three-day, four-city trip arranged for 46 foreign correspondents, who interviewed nearly 150 repatriated students and some of their parents. Burmese officials could not recall such a large foreign press presence since the country gained independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1948. Speaking with the authorities present, most students denied knowledge of arrests or lengthy interrogations although a few said they knew of some returning activists who were detained. Among students the government assembled for the journalists in the city of <LOCATION> Taunggyi </LOCATION> were <PERSON> Myo </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON> <PERSON> Htun </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> <PERSON> Moe </PERSON>, whom <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> had said were feared arrested. <PERSON> Myo </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON> <PERSON> Htun </PERSON> charged Thai authorities had exerted `` psychological pressure'' on him and some colleagues to return to <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> from a special repatriation center. He said he was forced to dig cesspools and cut down trees. He went on a hunger strike to protest his return. <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> has said that all students returned voluntarily from its border center. `` We were not molested but we're uncertain about our situation,'' said <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Htu </PERSON>, a 26-year-old student from <LOCATION> Meiktila </LOCATION>. He and virtually all others expressed their support for a democractic system and free elections. <PERSON> Khin </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyunt </PERSON> said he could not specify the date of elections to end one-party rule that began in 1962. But official sources said these would probably not take place until late this year or 1990. While the military had not set a polling date, Western analysts had speculated they would be held before mid-1989. To date, 182 political parties have registered with the election commission. <PERSON> Khim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyunt </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Restoration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, acknowledged that authorities were detaining some people, including lawyer Nay Min and political satirist <PERSON> Thu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ra </PERSON>, on charges of inciting insurrection and endangering national unity during the uprisings. But he denied Nay Min and Thu Ra had been tortured or poorly treated in detention. Uprisings last year prompted the resignation of Ne Win, who took over in a 1962 military coup. Pro-democracy protests by hundreds of thousands of people forced the resignation of his successor and led to the sacking of another by the military.

<HEAD>Trading Seats at Commodity Exchanges Hitting Selling Block</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal investigators probing allegations of widespread fraud at the nation's largest futures exchanges pressured three suspects into secretly taping conversations with employers and other traders, a newspaper reported today. The three were among a number of traders suspected of fraud who have provided the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> with fresh evidence in the two-year probe, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> said, quoting unidentified sources. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents have been visiting the homes of traders suspected of wrongdoing, threatening them with criminal charges and demanding cooperation, the newspaper reported. Law enforcement sources said the three suspects were fitted with hidden recording devices and told to call on colleagues to obtain recorded admissions of guilt from those involved in fraud at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The investigation centers on allegations that investors were cheated out of millions of dollars, according to published reports. Seats on the exchanges, which go for hundreds of thousands of dollars, have been selling like hot commodities by traders panicked by the probe. Fourteen seats were sold at the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> starting Thursday, when the investigation was first reported, through the end of business hours Friday. `` We had a week's worth of sales in a day,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Yemma </PERSON>, chief spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>. Officials in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's office have said nothing publicly about the investigation, but news of subpoenas for exchange records dating back to January 1983 has shaken the industry. `` Everybody is obviously concerned about what this means,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON>. `` If there are people breaking the rules, of course people that make an honest living in this business think they ought to be punished,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> pork belly trader, who asked that his name not be used, said after a day of trading Friday. `` The mood's very uneasy,'' said a soybean futures trader, who also asked that his name not be used. `` Everybody's worried about what's going to happen. ... It's very unsettling to long-time members.'' Commodities exchanges are hotbeds of capitalism in which speculators bet millions of dollars on the future prices of goods ranging from gold to <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills to frozen orange juice. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents-turned-traders recorded conversations that suggest some trades were rigged to prevent customers from getting fair-market prices, and that some brokers sent false reports to customers to hide the skimming of profits of overcharges on commissions, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> has said. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Koshutko </PERSON> would neither confirm nor deny the investigation, but two law enforcement officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed it Thursday. The seats, which allow traders access to various markets on the trading floor, sell for a wide range of prices. The Merc has 2,724 seats and the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> has 3,400. Last year the price of a <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> seat ranged from $ 350,000 to $ 523,500, officials said. Prices for Board of Trade seats ranged from $ 371,000 to $ 545,000.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s undercover probe of the world's two largest futures exchanges exposes the fraud potential that many believe is inherent in the industry's raucous, century-old trading method. The investigation of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> reportedly targets individual traders who rigged trades and skimmed profits. Unlike Wall Street's insider-trading scandal, which apparently involved a relatively small number of professionals active in a limited segment of the stock market, the commodities allegations strike at the heart of the futures industry _ the crowded trading `` pits'' where the business actually takes place. Experts say the frenetic trading system used in the pits provides opportunity for fraud and raises problems in tracking whether traders are obeying the rules. Futures traders in the pits stand shoulder-to-shoulder, frequently for hours at a time, shouting and using hand signals to strike deals. This system is known as `` open-outcry'' trading and has remained essentially unchanged since the early days of grain trading on the 141-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, the world's oldest and largest futures exchange. Trading is permitted only in the pits during specified trading hours and traders are forbidden by exchange rules from playing favorites. A trader seeking to sell a contract must accept the first offer that meets his asking price. At least part of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> probe is believed to be focused on pairs of traders who arranged ahead of time complicated trading schemes that would allow both of them to share in profits skimmed from customer accounts. Such schemes often involve executing customer orders and trading for one's own account simultaneously, a controversial _ but entirely legal _ practice. The investigation also is believed to have uncovered instances in which traders simply reported to their brokerage firms trades that were different from the trades they actually made. These instances also require collusion among traders because exchange rules require both the buyer and the seller to report their trades. Pre-arranged trading and commodity fraud are nothing new; traders readily admit that the potential is always there for those so inclined, partly because of the difficulty in monitoring traders both inside and outside of the pits. It is not unusual for unscrupulous traders to be caught. On Thursday, even as news of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> probe was breaking, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> announced the unrelated expulsion of two of its members for pre-arranging trades. The most alarming aspects of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation are its breadth _ one news service reported that 150 people could be implicated _ and its depth. Undercover agents wearing concealed microphones reportedly recorded conversations with other traders on and off the exchange floors over a period of two years. `` There's a fear of the unknown'' among <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s trading community, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Troelstrup </PERSON>, an industry lawyer. `` It's the sudden realization that they have been in the midst of people who are not of them, wearing wires.'' Some experts see the advent of electronic trading _ using computerized rather than human traders to match customer buy and sell orders _ as a way to reduce the fraud potential of commodities trading. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> is a leader in this area and is preparing to launch a fully automated trading system called <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION> that would operate during the hours its trading floor is closed. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> opposes the concept, saying the open-outcry system is more efficient, and has raised objections with federal regulators who have yet to approve <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION>. But even electronic trading would not erase the potential for abuse, experts say. `` It will be easier to keep track of trades that are recorded electronically than it is when you depend on people in the pits to write them down in the midst of furor,'' said one industry consultant. `` But just like electronic banking, they'll have problems that nobody anticipated. `` Somebody who knows the system can figure out innovative ways to beat the system,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Commodities exchanges are hotbeds of capitalism in which speculators essentially bet millions of dollars on the future prices of goods ranging from gold to <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills to frozen orange juice. The purpose of the futures exchanges is to transfer the risk of price fluctuations from people who do n't want the risk, such as farmers or metals processors, to speculators who are willing to take a gamble on making big profits. Futures contracts are agreements to deliver a quantity of goods at a specified price at a certain time in the future. Options, which also are widely traded on the exchanges, give purchasers the right but not the obligation to buy or sell something at a certain price within a specified period. Commodities traders, standing in recessed `` pits'' and dressed in brightly colored jackets, shout orders and wave hand signals to each other in a free-for-all auction of contracts. Because trading is so chaotic, some rules infractions are hard to detect immediately. For example, a dishonest trader could cheat a client by paying more than necessary for a contract ordered by the client. The seller who got the extra profit would later return the favor. In a typical transaction on a commodities exchange, a farmer who wants to lock in a guaranteed price to minimize risk will promise to deliver 20,000 pounds of live beef cattle at a specified future date at a specified price. Assuming the price goes up, the speculator who buys the contract could take the cattle from the farmer and resell them to someone else at the higher prevailing market price, pocketing the profit. But if the price goes down, the speculator would lose money by having to pay the farmer the agreed-upon price and then resell the cattle at the lower market price. In practice, speculators rarely end up with mountains of tin or pork bellies _ they sell their positions at a profit or loss before the delivery date. The ultimate buyer is a customer that actually needs the commodity. Although the exchanges started out with agricultural products, they have rapidly expanded into financial products.

<TEXT>
 A Sri Lankan man deported from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> after a two-year battle for asylum returned home today and accused the British government of racism. <PERSON> Viraj </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendis </PERSON> had sought asylum since late 1986 by holing up in an English church. His fight ended when British authorities broke into the church Wednesday and two days later put him on an <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> flight to his <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> homeland. `` I am happy to be back in my homeland, but I am angry for being deported by the racist British government,'' the 32-year-old <PERSON> Mendis </PERSON> told reporters upon his arrival. He was escorted by a British policeman, two British immigration officers and the Rev. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>, an Anglican priest who described himself as a friend. <PERSON> Mendis </PERSON> said he feared persecution or death if he returned to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, which is wracked by ethnic violence between guerrillas of the majority Sinhalese and the minority Tamils. Nearly 10,000 people have died in five years of fighting. Foreign Ministry Secretary W.T. <PERSON> Jayasimsghe </PERSON> said: `` I do n't think anything is going to happen to Mr. <PERSON> Mendis </PERSON>.'' But <PERSON> Mendis </PERSON> said the government could n't guarantee his safety. `` I am a Sinhalese and, as a Communist, support the Tamil liberation struggle. I fear the Sinhalese chauvinists and, of course, I do n't believe any assurance given by the Sri Lankan government.'' Police arrested <PERSON> Mendis </PERSON> in the northern English city of <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>. He had moved into the church after being issued a deportation order in 1986, 13 years after going to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> as a student. <PERSON> Mendis </PERSON>' removal from the church sparked an outcry from supporters, who said the action violated his ancient right to sanctuary in a church. Under English common law, a person accused of committing a crime could take sanctuary in a church but had to surrender or leave the country in 40 days. This right was abolished in 1623, but <PERSON> Mendis </PERSON>' supporters chose the ancient right as his last resort to stay in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> <PERSON> Mendis </PERSON> was met at the airport by his younger brother, <PERSON> Suresh </PERSON>, and an uncle, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mendis </PERSON> said he would not be living with his family in the southern town of <LOCATION> Kalutara </LOCATION> `` for security reasons.'' Instead, he said, he is heading for an undisclosed location to write his memoirs.

<HEAD>Cold Weather Military Exercise to Begin in Alaska</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 26,000 troops, 120 aircraft and 1,000 vehicles from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> began maneuvers across <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> in the military's regular test of personnel and machines in freezing temperatures. `` This may be the premier cold-weather exercise in the Free World,'' <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> McInerney </PERSON>, commander of <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force-Alaska </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday as the biennal exercise began Friday. `` Brim Frost'89'' _ a $ 15 million training exercise involving the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, reserve units and the Canadian Forces _ is to continue through Feb. 1. `` We hold some exercises like this in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, but they're a little different,'' <PERSON> McInerney </PERSON> said. `` Here you have an entire -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- division operating in an arctic environment.'' Maneuvers were planned at more than 17 sites around <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, but the focus will be a major land battle between two Army brigades on the <ORGANIZATION> Tanana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Greely </LOCATION>, about 75 miles southeast of Fairbanks. That will include a battalion-sized Canadian force dropped by parachute, officials said. `` It will be a rehearsal of the procedures we'd have to go through if we actually had to defend <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>,'' said Army Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fields </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, in charge of land forces during the exercise. Brim Frost'87 _ slightly smaller with 24,000 troops _ focused primarily on unconventional warfare, where <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> forces faced guerrilla units and defended airfields, remote radar stations, ports, a trans-Alaska oil pipeline pump station and other sites from attack. Planners said they will emphasize safety throughout Brim Frost'89. No live ammunition is to be used, but troops will face temperatures that are expected to plummet to 50 degrees below zero. `` Safety is a very challenging thing,'' <PERSON> McInerney </PERSON> said. `` If you do n't have any accidents, then it's a tribute to your professionalism.'' `` Our track record in the past has been very good,'' Fields said. `` Last month, 3,500 soldiers at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Greely </LOCATION> trained in weather that was 44 below zero and they came through the exercise with no serious cold-related injuries.'' Fields said at a news conference Wednesday there is a lot of difference between simply being out in the cold and operating in the cold. `` We'll not back off our exercises simply because the weather drops,'' Fields said. `` It teaches you how to cope. Our potential adversaries are very good at this business.''

<HEAD>South Korea Agrees To Preparatory Talks With North Korea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> today accepted a North Korean call for working-level border contacts to arrange high-level talks on easing tension on the divided <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. Government officials said a telephone message was issued through the border truce village of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> to inform <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> that South Korean Prime Minister <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-hoon </PERSON> would deliver a letter Monday to his North Korean counterpart, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyung </PERSON> <PERSON> Muk </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kang </PERSON>'s letter would contain remarks agreeing to <PERSON> Yon </PERSON>'s earlier proposal that a Feb. 8 meeting be held at <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> by vice ministers to work out terms for full-scale talks, they said. It was not clear if <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> would agree to the date set by the north. The two <LOCATION> Koreas </LOCATION> have agreed to hold political and military talks headed by their prime ministers on ending military confrontation to help unify the peninsula. If realized, the talks would be involve the highest level of officials since the Korean War began in 1950. <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was split into the communist north and the capitalist south in 1945, when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet troops ended <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s colonial rule at the end of World War II. Talks in the past have produced little progress, with each side insisting on its own proposals. In today's message, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> also said its <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> officials would send a letter Tuesday urging <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to resume <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> talks stalled in 1985. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has rejected <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> calls for separate economic and <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> talks. The north closed several channels of talks on humanitarian and other concerns in 1985 to protest annual U.S.-South Korean military exercises.

 Promoters conceded that Super Bowl week was a fiasco, but remained confident the weekend festivities and game could be salvaged despite three days of rioting and racial unrest. `` There is no question that it really hurts, but we think our community can recover,'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Scurr </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Super </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bowl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Host </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday. `` It's already started ... The mood is lifting and I think people will be able to enjoy the celebration.'' <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> once viewed Super Bowl week as a crown jewel in the tourism comeback for south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>, <PERSON> Liza </PERSON> <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> performed Friday night at the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arena </ORGANIZATION>, and another concert was scheduled for tonight. At a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> shopping center and park, thousands of excited partiers watched fireworks explode over <LOCATION> Biscayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and listened to salsa and jazz bands. In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, 3,000 people held a bash held by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rozelle </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Stephen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Muss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> has worked to rebuild its image as a tourist mecca since 1980, when the troubles began: devastating riots that year, the <PERSON> Mariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Boatlift </PERSON>, the upspurt in the drug trade and bad press such as a `` Paradise Lost'' cover story in Time magazine. `` Those factors created such an unappealing perception of the place,'' said <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON>, an executive with the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> and Visitor's <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. `` We lost 1.3 million tourists in the next five years.'' But in the last few years, he said, `` We felt like we were on a roll.'' Earlier this week, riots triggered by the shooting of a black motorcyclist by a Hispanic policeman left one man dead and 11 others shot in two black neighborhoods. Thirteen buildings were torched and others looted, authorities said. Veteran <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> publicist <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said the tragedy of those riots went far beyond the damage to the tourism industry and the city's image. `` I was saddened ... a feeling of shock, disbelief,'' said the 68-year-old <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, who has lived here for 50 years. The city has made major strides to come back after the heyday of the 1950s and'60s, when TV shows like <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON>'s originated in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, helping to make the tropical city popular throughout the country, <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said. But in the 1970s, the hotels began to age, too many apartments and condos were built, and the economy declined. The devestating blow came in 1980, with the boatlift and the riots, which killed 18 and injured hundreds. More riots followed in 1982 and 1984. The <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area had about 7 million visitors in 1980. It finally approached that total again in 1988. The completion of the colorful <ORGANIZATION> Bayside </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketplace </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 and the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arena </LOCATION> last year helped revive the inner city, and the art deco district of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> is coming back. Landing the Super Bowl seemed to put the seal of approval on <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> as a tourist destination. But this week's rioting brought the progress into question. `` My first reaction was ` Why now?''' said <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON>. `` If it had happened when we did n't have 2,000-plus media here, then I do n't think the nationwide response would have been as wide-ranging and immediate as it was. But the city seemed to be easing back to normal. Police were out in force to assure the weekend is a success. And <PERSON> Rozelle </PERSON> reassured <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> that the riots would not affect the city's chance to host another Super Bowl.

 A former member of a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> street gang testified that <PERSON> Noah </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, half-brother of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, wielded a great deal of power over the organization, which was known for its violence. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> is on trial for murder and conspiracy in the January 1986 death of <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> `` Hambone'' Barber. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> is accused of hiring the <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rukn </LOCATION> gang to go to <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> to kill <PERSON> Barber </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s childhood friend. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, formerly a high-ranking member of the <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rukn </LOCATION> gang, testified Friday that he participated in planning Barber's slaying but did not pull the trigger <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> testified that he and another member of the gang met with <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> about a week after Christmas in 1985. `` He had said he had been home and had a fight with <PERSON> Hambone </PERSON>, and he had kicked his behind,'' he testified. `` He said he was tired of the situation and wanted us to take care of it.'' <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, who has also been charged with murder in the death, said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> was a close friend of <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Fort </PERSON>, the chief of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rukn </LOCATION> now in a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> prison. `` He -LRB- Fort -RRB- told us whenever you listen to <PERSON> Noah </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, it's like you listen to me,'' <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said `` If he says do something, it's like I said do it.'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> native who now lives in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, has maintained that he is a victim of a political conspiracy caused partly by the success of his half-brother. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> have the same father, but the former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> presidential candidate has said he has had no recent contact with his half-brother. Earlier Friday, another witness for the prosecution testified that she heard <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> threaten to kill <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> and that <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> had a heavy cocaine habit she helped supply. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> described the complicated structure of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> gang and how they made millions of dollars through narcotics, contract murder and extortion. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said he first met <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> when the gang attempted to move into some legitimate businesses. Circuit Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> agreed Thursday to combine the murder and conspiracy charges and the charge that <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> conspired to kill a witness to <PERSON> Barber </PERSON>'s death, who survived a stabbing attack.

 As <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> slept for the first time in the White House, 1,000 revelers spent today's early morning hours dancing to an up-tempo `` Hail to the Chief'' in a no-holds-barred spoof of his inauguration. Partygoers at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Inaugural Ball greeted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> impersonator <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovacic </PERSON> with boos and derisive whistles as the look-alike mimicked the new president in a satirical address. `` Here comes the theme,'' <PERSON> Kovacic </PERSON> said after being introduced by cartoon characters <PERSON> Batman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> and sworn in by a human Statue of Liberty. `` A new breeze. There's a new breeze blowing. We all can feel it ... especially the millions who choose to sleep in the great outdoors. `` As there's hope, there will be a new breeze. But if that breeze blows too hard, it will extinguish the 1,000 points of light and you wo n't be able to read my lips.'' The party was held to greet the installation of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> with cheery displeasure. Of those in attendance asked about their political preferences, almost all voted for <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the November election. The <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> inauguration, advertised as `` the political party for the rest of us,'' featured lighting by <ORGANIZATION> Thousand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Points </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and performances of the satirical songs `` A Kinder, Gentler Nation'' and `` Out of the Loop.'' Admission was $ 15, but card-carrying members of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> got in for $ 13.50. Any profits were to be donated to an environmental group. `` It's absolutely a celebration, but, of course, black is to be worn,'' said organizer <PERSON> Pacy </PERSON> <PERSON> Markman </PERSON>, an advertising copywriter. `` The inauguration in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was done with smoke and mirrors. We're just merely holding up the mirror.'' <PERSON> Markman </PERSON> wrote both `` A Kinder, Gentler Nation'' and `` Out of the Loop.'' The latter song, the title of which refers to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s response to questions about his involvement in the Iran-Contra affair, also hints at the party's real purpose _ to point up the president's supposed shortcomings `` I was out of the loop when it happened,'' goes the song. `` I was out of the loop through it all. I'll give you a scoop, I was out of the loop. Talking to me is like talking to a wall.'' `` We're not wishing Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ill,'' <PERSON> Markman </PERSON> said. `` But the whole idea of this is that people have really been put to sleep by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and you can either awaken them by a slap in face ... or, as we're hoping, to wake them up with some good humor and some excellent music `` We were n't invited to the other inaugural. But ours is not out of spite. It's very possible that we might have done this if there were a Democrat in office.''

 Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., got into a shouting argument in a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> bar with a former bouncer who `` insulted the memory of his brothers,'' according to a Kennedy spokesman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> McKenna </PERSON>, 32, a former city hospital security officer who once worked at the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> <LOCATION> bar </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trash </ORGANIZATION>, said he filed a harassment complaint with police, which was later dropped. Police said Friday they were unable to confirm whether a complaint had been filed after the alleged Jan. 12 incident. Bar manager <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> came into the bar about 2:30 a.m. that day. `` He was hanging out, talking to some people, and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> McKenna </PERSON> was being a real jerk,'' <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said. According to reports Friday in the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> and on <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>'s `` A Current Affair,'' <PERSON> McKenna </PERSON> said he had gone over to <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, told him he did not think it wise for him to be there and offered to help him if he needed it. He said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, 56, answered that he did not need help, but during a later confrontation, he told the senator, `` You're nothing like your other two brothers.'' <PERSON> McKenna </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> then threw a drink at him. The two men went outside and shouted at each other, and when <PERSON> McKenna </PERSON> went to pull identification out of his wallet, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> slapped his hand. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON>, issued a statement in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Thursday night saying the senator stopped at the bar after going to the theater and eating supper. `` After dropping off friends on the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>, he stopped at the bar on his way back to his sister <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawford </PERSON>'s apartment,'' the statement said. `` A stranger in the bar began to harass him, and when the man insulted the memory of his brothers, Sen. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> took offense and angry words were exchanged. `` Sen. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said the incident was of no consequence, and he regretted that it had occurred,'' <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> said. He declined to comment further. <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said <PERSON> McKenna </PERSON>, who was once employed as a doorman at American Trash, `` had a little too much to drink'' and was asked to leave the bar after he hassled <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. <PERSON> McKenna </PERSON> said he did not want to pursue the complaint because he felt sorry for <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> said in its Celebrity column.

 Grief-stricken family and friends mourned the deaths of five school children gunned down during recess, while the killer was buried nearly unnoticed in a nearby town. Parents and teachers continued counseling the children who witnessed Tuesday's schoolyard slayings, trying to help them deal with the tragedy. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>, 24, opened fire outside the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> with an AK-47 semiautomatic assault rifle, firing more than 100 rounds, killing five children and wounding 29 others and one teacher. Three days and nights of prayer began Thursday for two of the youngsters killed, and services for the other children were being held today and Monday. Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> was to attend Monday's services <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> was buried Friday in nearby <LOCATION> Lodi </LOCATION>, said his grandmother, <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Chumbley </PERSON>. He was interred following a service at Cherokee Memorial Cemetery, which several of his relatives attended, she said. Fourteen of the wounded students were still hospitalized, but most were reported in improved conditions. At <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, about three-quarters of the school's 970 pupils had returned to classes by Friday, about three times the number who attended Wednesday, but it was anything but a routine school day. Counselors and school psychologists were assisting teachers in classrooms, and some parents sat in with their children to comfort and reassure them. One mother, who asked not to be identified, told reporters that her youngest son, a 7-year-old second grader who was on playground when the shootings occurred, would only come back to school if she stayed with him. `` They're making it back, slowly but surely,'' she said, adding that she planned to spend Friday as she did Thursday, at her son's side in the classroom <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> is in the heart of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s third-largest community of refugees from <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, and nearly two-thirds of the school's population is from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. All of the dead children were from refugee families, as were 19 of the 29 wounded. School authorities said they were particularly concerned that the killing might not only revive the psychological trauma of the horrors they experienced in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, but that those families might flee from the area without accepting counseling if they feared a racial motive in the attack. `` We want to pass the word to the community that this is not a racist act ... It could happen to anybody, anywhere, anytime. This is a crazy action from one individual. It is not racism,'' said An Tran of the Southeast Asian Refugee Resettlement Program. <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON> Police Capt. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> also repeated that there was no evidence that <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>, who committed suicide after the attack, was specifically targeting Asians. `` It was n't any one race or group of people. He hated everybody,'' <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>, who as a child 14 years earlier had attended <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>.

 <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> met today with <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to hammer out an official response to a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> offer to legalize the trade federation The Solidarity leader was expected to advise the union leadership to begin long-delayed talks on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s future with the communist government. Earlier today, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> attended a rally by 4,000 workers inside the <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> shipyard where Solidarity was born, but he did not speak. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> summoned the commission to this Baltic port to respond to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement Thursday that it will legalize Solidarity after a seven-year ban if certain conditions are negotiated. The commission's 20 members and 10 advisers and local Solidarity activists met at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basilica </ORGANIZATION> several blocks from the shipyard, then moved to a more private meeting place at a convent near the city's <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. In the past, the commission has followed <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s recommendations. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, winner of the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize, told suspicious workers at the shipyard Friday he also has doubts about the authorities' good intentions. The Polish government cracked down on the independent trade union federation during the labor upheaval of 1980, declaring martial law in December 1981 and banning Solidarity the next year. A tape recording of Friday's closed, 1 -LCB- - hour meeting was obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, and in reply to a question accusing authorities of always lying to workers, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said: `` I do n't trust them either But if someone gives a chance for -LRB- trade union -RRB- pluralism, I take the chance.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told the worker that the party's change in policy was significant. `` They have never proposed pluralism before. And what's even more _ economic, union and political pluralism. Our people are checking already today what it may mean in practice. `` If we are really getting economic, social and political pluralism, I say, ` Thank you very much, gentlemen.' It has never happened in the party before. It will mean breaking the monopoly. And that's the point.'' Later, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told reporters at the shipyard gates, `` I will do everything on my side to begin talks about <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> ... as soon as possible.'' But he said that was his personal view and Solidarity's official statement would come only after the meeting of the executive commission. The government proposed formal talks to include <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, the authorities, the official trade unions and other social groups during a wave of strikes in August. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is wracked by economic unrest, rising inflation, scarce supplies of basic commodities and its $ 39 billion foreign debt. After some fitful preliminary talks last year, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> refused the invitation until the party agreed to legalize the union. This week's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> plenum seems to have satisfied that demand, said <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON>, a senior adviser to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. After that plenum, communist authorities said they would be willing to legalize Solidarity if the trade union membership promised to obey the law, not go out on strike for a period of time and help reform the economy. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told reporters he has to bargain with authorities because <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s problems are so daunting. Millions of Poles were treated to an unprecedented barrage of openness in the official news media about Solidarity and other sensitive political topics. The coverage left many people shaking their heads in wonder. `` What's going on in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>?'' said one worker at the <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> shipyard when asked about the heavy coverage that portrayed <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> as an official figure, even though Solidarity remains technically illegal. State television also showed police controlling demonstrators in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, a Politburo member explaining why he voted against the party's new position on unions, and a Solidarity-led strike at a textile plant in <LOCATION> Lodz </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>FAA Orders Boeing 767 Wiring Checked In Addition to 757's</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operators of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 767 jetliners have been ordered by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to inspect the wiring in cargo compartment fire suppression systems. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> earlier required similar checks on <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 757 jets. <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> regional office here, said the airworthiness directive was issued late Friday as a precautionary measure because of the similarity between the fire protection systems on the two models. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> issued an airworthiness directive for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operators of the mid-sized 757s to check the cargo hold fire-suppression systems after wiring problems were found on a Royal <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION> jet and a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> 757. Airlines around the world subsequently found wiring mistakes on five more 757s. Investigators said some of the errors would have caused the wrong extinquisher to work in the event of a cargo hold fire. Other mistakes would have indicated a fire to the pilot without activating an extinguisher. Wiring in <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> planes got widespread public attention recently following the Jan. 7 crash of a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midlands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 in central <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in which 44 people died. Faulty wiring is one possibility being examined by investigators. On Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> asked 26 operators of 767s worldwide to check the fire extinguisher wiring. `` We put one out yesterday alerting 767 operators worldwide to inspect their fire extinguishing systems, not because there was any incident involving a 767, but because it was prudent,'' <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> said Friday. He said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> directive `` now just ensures it will be checked.'' Both <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> said they knew of no wiring problems on 767s, although <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> said that last spring, some piping for cargo-hold fire extinguishers on 767s were found to be misconnected. That problem was corrected, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> said the 767 order `` calls for a check of cargo compartment fire protection system wiring and, if necessary, to ensure the wiring is correctly configured.'' He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operators of the planes will be required to make the inspection by Jan. 30 and to report any findings of incorrect wiring to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> within 72 hours of making the check. <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operators affected are <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> with 40 767s, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> with 30, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> with 19, <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> with 11 and <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> with 11. Worldwide, there are 246 767s in service, <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> said. While the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> order is not binding on foreign carriers, <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> said many foreign regulatory agencies often follow the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s lead in requiring inspections. The 757 and 767, both twin-engine jets, were designed at the same time in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The 767, which carries 170 to 261 passengers, depending upon model and configuration, entered service in 1982. The 757, which entered service in 1984, can carry between 186 and 239 passengers.

<HEAD>More Than 1,700 Officials Pay Respects To Late Emperor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 1,700 Cabinet members, lawmakers and other government workers paid their respects to the late Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> in a ceremony at the Imperial Palace today, palace officials said. The officials said 1,748 people attended the ceremony, held from morning through evening at the palace `` hinkyu,'' or imperial mortuary, where the body of the late emperor will remain until his funeral on Feb. 24. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> died Jan. 7 of cancer at age 87. Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and leading members of the three branches of government paid their respects in a similar ceremony Friday, a day after the emperor's coffin was moved to the makeshift mortuary, the officials said. In addition, ceremonies will be held almost daily at the mortuary until the funeral next month, with members of the imperial family and Shinto ritualists offering prayers, food and court music. Shinto derives from ancient nature worship and today includes worship of the sun goddess, the imperial ancestors and thousands of other deities. Also today, a newspaper reported that <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s son and successor, Emperor <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, wrote in an essay in 1945 that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s lack of group skills, material wealth and technological prowess led to its World War II defeat despite the innate Japanese superiority over Americans The essay, penned by the then 11-year-old crown prince, was copied by the late vice Grand <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> <PERSON> Michio </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinoshita </PERSON>, an employee of the <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, and recently disclosed. `` If an individual Japanese is compared with an individual American, a Japanese is superior on every point,'' the crown price wrote shortly after the war, the daily <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported. But <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> added that Japanese lacked skills to efficiently organize group strength. `` The people gathered their courage and fought diligently, but the war was lost nevertheless,'' the crown prince wrote. `` That is because the Anglo-American forces had incomparable material superiority and because <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s war tactics were extremely skillful.'' `` Japanese thought more of themselves than of their country and acted selfishly. That is why we were not able to win this total war,'' he wrote. He described the radio broadcast by his father in 1945 announcing <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s unconditional surrender to the Allies as a `` fearful thing'' for his father to `` bear the people's humiliation.'' He also expressed regret over the defeat. The crown prince wrote of his determination that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> be rebuilt after the wartime destruction.

<HEAD>Extremist Leader Claims To Quash Challenge From Dissenters</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: TerreBlanch is cq.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The leader of a nationwide white-supremacist group, accused by colleagues of misconduct and womanizing, claimed he won a unanimous vote of confidence at a meeting today. Several of the dissenters said they were barred from the auditorium or ejected before the vote was taken. Armed members of the group, wearing its swastika-like emblem, patrolled outside the hall under the surveillance of about 100 policemen. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> TerreBlanche </PERSON>, a fiery orator who often closes his speeches with a Hitler-style salute, has headed the <ORGANIZATION> Afrikaner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> since he helped found it in 1973. Its membership is kept secret, but <PERSON> TerreBlanche </PERSON> often draws thousands of whites to his rallies. The unprecedented challenge to his leadership began last month after he allegedly tried to ram his car through a gate at an Afrikaner historical monument near <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. He was accompanied by <PERSON> Jani </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON>, a former model who now writes a column for the nationally circulated <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> TerreBlanche </PERSON>, who is married, has denied any improper relationship with Ms. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON>. She had previously interviewed <PERSON> TerreBlanche </PERSON> for one of her columns. The incident led to police filing a charge of malicious damage against <PERSON> TerreBlanche </PERSON>, and four senior members of the resistance movement demanded his resignation. One of them accused <PERSON> TerreBlanche </PERSON> of womanizing and excessive drinking, charges which <PERSON> TerreBlanche </PERSON> denied. About 300 members of the resistance movement _ known by its Afrikaans initials as the <ORGANIZATION> AWB </ORGANIZATION> _ attended today's meeting at a hall in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. Dries <PERSON> Alberts </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> AWB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman who had joined in challenging <PERSON> TerreBlanche </PERSON>, told reporters he was carried out of the meeting hall in his wheelchair after he arrived. Other dissenters said they were barred from entering the hall. `` Today would have been an ideal opportunity for solving the <ORGANIZATION> AWB </ORGANIZATION>'s serious problems, but the meeting has been turned into an utter farce,'' <PERSON> Alberts </PERSON> said. <PERSON> TerreBlanche </PERSON> declined to field questions from <ORGANIZATION> AWB </ORGANIZATION> delegates but gave a 30-minute speech in which, to loud cheers, he reiterated his call for creation of a whites-only state in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` There will not and can not be schism in the <ORGANIZATION> AWB </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` The press thought I was going to resign today, but they will be resigning instead.'' After the meeting, some reporters were invited to attend a brief news conference, but the <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>' representative was not allowed in. Despite its extremist stance, the <ORGANIZATION> AWB </ORGANIZATION> is viewed as politically influential because of its ties to the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which won 26 percent of the vote in the 1987 white election on a platform urging tougher enforcement of segregation laws. The governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has emphasized the link between the <ORGANIZATION> AWB </ORGANIZATION> and the Conservatives, seeking to suggest that the opposition party is reliant on dangerous extremists.

 A key senator said today the government probably would let former President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> come home if he returned money he is accused of stealing and made a public apology. <PERSON> Jovito </PERSON> <PERSON> Salonga </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> president, said he believes <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> must do what <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s disgraced former president, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-Hwan </PERSON>, did last year. `` If <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> decides to do a <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-Hwan </PERSON> _ that is, make a public apology, seek our people's forgiveness and restore his ill-gotten wealth _ there will be enough time for the former president and his lawyers to initiate a plea - bargaining process ... with the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> courts and prosecutors ... authorities in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and the government of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Salonga </PERSON> The government of President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has refused to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. He fled to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> after he was swept out of office in February 1986 in a military-civilian uprising that put Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> in power. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, face racketeering charges in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. They are accused of looting $ 103 million from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and using it in part to buy real estate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Critics say <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> accumulated $ 5 - $ 10 billion during his 20-year administration <PERSON> Salonga </PERSON> added that if <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> `` decides to insist on his innocence and refuses to do a <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-Hwan </PERSON>, the Aquino government may no longer be blamed for refusing to consider his return.'' <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> made a public apology to his country in November, surrendered assets worth $ 24 million, and went into rural exile in a remote temple. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> president, who formerly chaired a committee leading a worldwide search for money <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is accused of stealing, made his remarks today to a lawyer's group in the central port city of <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> acquired a copy of his speech in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a dispute over whether <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is too ill to be arraigned on racketeering charges remains unresolved. The 71-year-old <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> suffered a collapsed lung Thursday and was reported hospitalized in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>.

 For ice fishing fans <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> and <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Issendorf </PERSON>, the best catch of the day was each other. They exchanged wedding vows on the thick ice of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Battle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, but neither got cold feet in this western <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> town. The wedding took place at the head of a snowplowed heart surrounded by fish houses. `` Several of our friends have fish houses out there, so there were places to go to warm up,'' <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> said. `` Some people fished.'' The ice-fishing nuptials Jan. 14 started as a joke for the couple, who got engaged last Valentine's Day. But after awhile, the joke started to make sense. `` We spend an awful lot of time out there ice fishing anyway, so we thought we might as well get married out there,'' <PERSON> Issendorf </PERSON> said. The temperature reached into the 20s, so the couple did n't even need the snowmobile suits they thought they would need for the 20-minute ceremony. Instead, the bride wore a white flannel shirt and blue corduroy pants over her long underwear. An ivory-white hat, royal blue coat, leg warmers over boots and a beaded scarf completed the look. The groom wore a green and purple plaid flannel shirt and navy corduroy pants. `` I knew it'd be a special day,'' <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> said. `` But I did n't think it would be quite like that.

 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> today closed its embassy in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, sources said, becoming the first foreign mission to shut down amid fears of an economic blockade and increased violence after all Soviet troops are withdrawn. The three remaining West German diplomats left this afternoon on a flight for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, with no prior announcement, said the Western diplomatic sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, the West German <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> confirmed it ordered its diplomats to leave <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> because of fears of increasing violence. But it said the embassy would continue to function `` on a reduced status'' and that the diplomats could return if the situation in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> improves. Other Western embassis say they are reviewing their positions now that it appears the Soviets may remove all their remaining troops by next month. The British Embasy this week warned Britons and nationals of six other countries for which it has diplomatic responsibiity to leave immediately. Earlier today, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> airlifted food supplies to the Afghan capital to combat shortages caused by rebel attacks and bad weather, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The official Soviet news agency reported from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> that the 3,500-ton airlift began Friday with three special flights. An English-language <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> report, monitored in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, said six flights arrived today with flour and other food supplies. There was no immediate independent confirmation the flights had arrived. Traffic has been heavy at the airport since the beginning of the month with giant transport planes arriving and leaving daily as Soviet troops try to meet a Feb. 15 deadline to depart <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The Afghan capital is increasingly tense because the withdrawal date for the final 50,000 Soviet soldiers is drawing closer. In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Chrobog </PERSON>, chief spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, said the remaining diplomats and their families left <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> today. But he said the embassy would continue to function `` on a reduced status'' and be maintained by a small local staff. <PERSON> Chrobog </PERSON> said the envoys had been ordered home on leave `` because of the growing danger'' and worsening economic conditions. <PERSON> Chrobog </PERSON> said he did not know how long the diplomatic staff would remain out of the country. `` We intend to watch developments there carefully before making a decision on when to return,'' he said. Soviet officals have warned they might not meet the deadline set in a U.N.-brokered accord because of continuing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> assistance to the anti-Marxist resistance. But recent reports indicate Soviet soldiers might be gone from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> by early February to protect the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> highway during the final withdrawal. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> aid officials welcomed the reported airlift and urged similar help from Western nations, which refuse to deal with the pro-Marxist government of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. Guerrilla disruption of convoys, which are also carrying ammunition, has been increasing as Soviet troops hand over escort duties and positions to government units along the key <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> highway from the Soviet border. Bad weather also has held up convoys. Today's English-language <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> report mentioned `` significant shortages because of the effort by the unreconcilable opposition to organize an economic blockade of the city.'' It also accused some <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> traders of engaging in `` open sabotage'' by hoarding food. Food prices have doubled in recent weeks, and long bread lines have formed in 20-degree temperatures. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has promised to keep supplying arms to <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s shaky government after Feb. 15 But it is uncertain whether <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will continue to supply <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, where guerrilla groups have closed in in the surrounding hills. The Soviet military, which intervened in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979, is expected to move its command from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to a northern border post at the end of January.

 After 11 years of silence about his crimes, condemned killer <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> began confessing to about 30 murders of young women in five Western states just days before his scheduled execution, an attorney said. `` Murders are being solved,'' <LOCATION> Volusia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> State Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>, who befriended <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orlando </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sentinel </ORGANIZATION> on Friday night. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> faces death in the electric chair at 7 a.m. Tuesday at <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> State Prison near <LOCATION> Starke </LOCATION> for the 1978 murder of a 12-year-old girl in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> said law enforcement officers from Western states told him that the 42-year-old former law student `` is giving them verifiable hard facts concerning unsolved murders,'' the newspaper reported today. After a 40-minute hearing this morning, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> rejected <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s latest appeal, ruling there was no evidence a lower court judge talked privately to prosecutors about <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s mental competence. The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> curtly rejected his appeal Friday. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said he would appeal to the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> would not identify the officers who spoke to him, but said <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> met Friday with <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Keppel </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state attorney general's office and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagmaier </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Behavioral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Quantico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Keppel </ORGANIZATION> met with <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> from late Friday morning until late evening and planned to meet with him today, The <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Intelligencer </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Keppel </ORGANIZATION> refused to discuss details of the conversations until he completed them. <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Macmaster </PERSON> said early today he had no information on anything Bundy may have told other law enforcement agencies. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> has frequently met with investigators and reporters, but previously refused to talk specifically about any cases. He was also scheduled to meet over the weekend with authorities from <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, who has also been sentenced to death for the 1978 slayings of two sorority sisters at <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>, is suspected in as many as three dozen slayings in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. The victims were young women, many of whom were never found. His case inspired the book `` The Deliberate Stranger'' and the television miniseries of the same name. In considering <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s appeal Friday, the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> not only ruled against him, but said it would not permit a petition for rehearing. It called the attempt to raise the issue of mental competency again `` an abuse of process.'' <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>, a former defense attorney who was elected to the prosecutor's post in November, was widely criticized Wednesday when Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> and other state officials announced he was trying to negotiate a stay of execution. But he said Friday that he is not advocating that <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s life be spared. `` I want to emphasize that my role was to put <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> in contact with law enforcement and I've done that,'' <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> said. `` It's disturbed me that it's come out any different. It's caused the people I represent to be very angry at me.'' Authorities from Western states have said they want Bundy to clear up the unsolved murders, but not if it meant delaying his execution. `` Certainly we want to know. But I'm not sure it matters to the extent of keeping him alive,'' said <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's Lt. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. `` Bundy is the quintessential manipulator, and it's our opinion he's doing that again.'' <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Detective <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Couch </PERSON> said Friday night that his scheduled 1 -LCB- - hour interview with <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> on Sunday should be enough time to solve any cases in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> But the mother of <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Naslund </PERSON>, 19, who was found dead just outside <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> two months after disappearing from a state park in July 1974, said she would n't mind a postponement if Bundy would confess. `` I would like to hear him say, ` I did murder your daughter,''' <PERSON> Eleanore </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said. `` I'd have lot more peace of mind if he would.'' <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> is under his fourth death warrant. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> signed the most recent warrant Tuesday after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> declined to hear the case. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s last stay of execution was in 1986, six hours before he was to go to the electric chair.

<HEAD>More than 4,000 Stolen Books Traced To Woman Who Died Last Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thirty boxes of stolen books that mysteriously turned up on a library doorstep earlier this month have been traced to a woman who died last year, authorities said. The boxes returned to the <LOCATION> Thornhill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Branch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Library Jan. 3, along with several more boxes and other missing library items recovered, yielded 4,369 books and magazines worth about $ 28,000, library spokeswoman <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said Friday. The mystery was solved when a lawyer for the woman's estate called several days after the initial dropoff and asked that the library pick up the remaining books, <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. The library dispatched a van to pick up the other boxes, and staff members needed two weeks to count, sort and return most of the materials to regular circulation. The haul included 1,300 paperback novels, most of them romances, and more than 400 magazines. The magazines and about 90 paperbacks were not returned to circulation because they were in bad condition or out of date. Most of the items appeared to have been taken between 1969 and 1984, when an electronic beeper security system was introduced at the <LOCATION> Thornhill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Branch </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> said. None of the books had been checked out. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> declined to identify the person who had taken the material other than as an elderly woman who was a `` heavy user'' of <PERSON> Thornhill </PERSON> materials. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said the library had decided against charging penalties to the woman's estate because the missing items had never been checked out in the first place _ and thus carried no overdue fines _ and because the items had been returned voluntarily.

 President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> will probably be discharged from a hospital next week but needs to rest for six weeks to recover from his stroke, a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister said today. Health Minister <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Niekerk </PERSON>, who is a doctor, said in a statement that <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> appeared to have made a remarkably speedy recovery from the stroke he suffered at home Wednesday.

Doctors later said the stroke had weakened his left arm and leg but did not affect his facial muscles and speech. On Thursday, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> appointed a longtime ally, Constitutional Development Minister <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON>, as acting president. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Niekerk </PERSON>'s statement did not say if <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> would return to work after his recovery. However, a pro-government newspaper, The Citizen, said today that `` the belief in government circles is that Mr. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> will carry on as president for the rest of this year _ or certainly until after a general election, now expected in the second half of the year.''

 Israeli soldiers accidentally killed a Palestinian mayor's bodyguard today while trying to defend the mayor from Arab stone-throwers who accused him of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters said. An army spokesman said a Palestinian was killed early today by soldiers in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Yatta </LOCATION>, 10 miles south of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, but the spokesman could not confirm whether the man worked as a bodyguard. Military sources said an Israeli-made Uzi machine gun was found next to the body of the Palestinian man. The army routinely gives weapons to pro-Israeli Palestinian figures. Arab reporters, who spoke on condition of anonymity, identified the dead man as <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Karaish </PERSON>, 28, and said he was a bodyguard for <LOCATION> Yatta </LOCATION>'s Israeli-appointed mayor, <PERSON> Ismaeel </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemeid </PERSON>. The reports said a small crowd of young Palestinian nationalists gathered in front of <PERSON> Hemeid </PERSON>'s home early today and began shouting slogans accusing him of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. When the group began to throw stones at his house, <PERSON> Hemeid </PERSON> called his armed bodyguards and the Israeli army. Israeli troops rushed to the scene, saw Palestinians with guns in front of <PERSON> Hemeid </PERSON>'s home and opened fire, accidentally killing <PERSON> Karaish </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters said. It was not immediately clear what <PERSON> Karaish </PERSON> was doing when he was shot. Military sources said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops opened fire after being shot at several times. An army spokesman said the military has sealed off the village and is investigating the incident. The Arab reporters said the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers apparently thought the bodyguards were members of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> strike force. On Thursday, a group calling itself the <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> issued a leaflet calling for attacks on soldiers and Jewish settlers. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> claims it is forming strike forces in villages and towns throughout the occupied territories under the command of Force-17, a unit of <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> wing of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. There have been no reported incidents of group members firing guns at <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops. More than a dozen Palestinians have been killed by their fellow Arabs for cooperating with the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military. On Friday, the deaths of two alleged collaborators were reported. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeredat </PERSON>, 36, was killed Thursday night by a shot in the face in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Banmk </LOCATION> village of <PERSON> Atil </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Irut </PERSON>, 18, died Friday of wounds sustained in a Jan. 12 shooting in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. Reporters said <PERSON> Jeredat </PERSON> was a shopkeeper who cooperated with the Israeli government and <PERSON> Irut </PERSON> was from a family closely linked with the authorities. Also today, a 60-year-old man was wounded in the neck in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> after troops opened fire with plastic bullets to disperse stone-throwing youths. On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> gave troops permission to fire plastic bullets at stone-throwers and Arabs setting up roadblocks. Fifteen Palestinians were wounded Friday in violence in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. At least 365 Palestinians have been killed during the 13-month uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the territories.

<HEAD>Fear Grips Afghan Capital As Soviets Withdraw</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> nearly gone, the capital's last line of defense is manned by disheveled Afghan troopers huddled around an armored vehicle, hugging themselves against the biting cold. Half a dozen tanks stand on the treeless, snow-covered terrain to the right of the soldiers, arranged in a rough semicircle with cannons pointed north. Shivering in their filthy uniforms, the troops stand at the foot of the vital <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> highway, three miles outside <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, with orders to stop Moslem guerrillas who have isolated the city since the Soviets left the countryside. This final line against the Moslem insurgency that began with a Commuist coup in 1978 looks as uncertain as the future after Feb. 15, the deadline for the Soviets to end their role in a war they joined nine years ago. Departing Soviet military forces leave behind a regime stockpiling ammunition for a battle of survival with the guerrillas, who ring the capital in mountain bases and have rejected proposals for a political settlement. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s daily life is a tableau of war, suffering, fear and efforts to escape. Amputees hobble in the potholed sreets. Long lines wait for visas at the <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> shut its visa section last month after a deluge of more than 250 applications a day, compared with five a month last year. Food and fuel are scarce because of guerrilla attacks on convoys along the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION>, making the bitter weather even harder to bear. The highway connects <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to the Soviet border, carrying <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers home and supply convoys south toward the capital. Giant Ilyushin 76 transports drop cascades of anti-missile flares as they climb from the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> airport, bound for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with soldiers and civilian advisers after delivering cargoes of ammunition. An average of six planes arrive and depart daily. Hundreds of fully equipped Soviet troops have been seen boarding them. Incoming road convoys roar down the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> with ammunition as well as food and fuel. North of the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION> toward the border, Soviet troops are digging in at new positions, diplomats say, apparently to secure the road for the final withdrawal. Workmen in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> are felling an avenue of trees and leveling the ground on either side of a long, wide road that runs from the <LOCATION> Darulaman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION>, headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, past the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. It is wide enough to accommodate smaller Antonov transports and there is speculation the Soviets are preparing an emergency airstrip. Indications are that thousands of Afghans, including supporters or beneficiaries of the current regime, are trying to slip away or make arrangements for quick exits. Since the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> stopped issuing visas, lines form outside the embassy of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, the nearest country for those who can afford air fare. Most embassies, down to skeleton staffs with families already evacuated, have contingency plans to close. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> has 11 American staff members left and says the question of whether to stay is `` under constant review.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> aid agencies have instructions from headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to withdraw 20 foreign staff by the end of January, leaving just eight. The West German <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday confirmed that it had ordered its diplomats to leave <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Fur-hatted Soviet troops still man mountainside artillery emplacements on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s outskirts but have handed over some posts on the perimeter road. Rumors abound, including one that Soviets are about to move part of their military headquarters from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Mazar-e-Sharaf </PERSON>. That city is near the Soviet border and, more importantly, on the other side of the daunting Hindu Kush mountain range. Some analysts believe the guerrillas, who have reduced rocket attacks on the capital, are holding off a major assault to let the Soviets out. President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> fills his public pronouncements with a blend of exhortations to fight on and urgings that the guerrillas resume talks with <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> representatives on a political solution. `` We will forge ahead and struggle,'' he told a recent gathering to mark the ninth anniversary of the feared <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION>. An estimated 115,000 Soviet soldiers were in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> when withdrawal began May 15 under a U.N.-mediated agreement signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. Half were gone by Aug. 15 and Feb. 15 is the deadline for all to be withdrawn.

 Visits to their old battlefields this week were a blend of tears and cheers, remembrance and reunions for six former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marines. One was reminded that a broken toe may have saved his life. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a 41-year-old maker of electric signs from <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, wept as he walked through <PERSON> Cam </PERSON> <PERSON> Lo </PERSON>, feeling the sting of a war he fought more than 20 years ago and the loss of men who served under him. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> did not remember <PERSON> Cam </PERSON> <PERSON> Lo </PERSON> as the peaceful village it is today but as the site of an attack on his squad, part of the 11th Engineers who cleaned <ORGANIZATION> Viet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cong </ORGANIZATION> mines from the highways and planted their own to protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases. `` Fortunately for me, we had gone on a detail to do some work and something fell on my foot and broke my toe,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. He had to remain in the rear at <ORGANIZATION> Dong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ha </ORGANIZATION> and another sergeant took over his squad. They swept Highway 9 west to <LOCATION> Cam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lo </LOCATION> and stayed overnight. A North Vietnamese battalion attacked Cam Lo that night and the first rocket-propelled grenades hit the engineer squad's truck, around which the men were sleeping. It started a fire that burned some of them to death. The 11th Marines were based just below the Demilitarized Zone that divided <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> at the 17th parallel, and five of the six men in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> now served in the battalion, but none had ventured into the <ORGANIZATION> DMZ </ORGANIZATION> until last week. `` Ever think you'd be standing here?'' <PERSON> Nate </PERSON> <PERSON> Genna </PERSON>, a 41-year-old maintenance worker from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, asked <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Spanos </PERSON>, 39, a police lieutenant in <LOCATION> Rosemont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` No way, brother,'' <PERSON> Spanos </PERSON> replied as they walked across the <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Hai </PERSON> bridge that divided the country until victory by the North in April 1975. Escorting them, by an irony of war, was Col. <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> <PERSON> Minh </PERSON> <PERSON> Thanh </PERSON>, who had tried to kill them a generation earlier by planting land mines on the highways they traveled. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> took a picture of his former foe. <PERSON> Spanos </PERSON> asked Thanh to autograph a map at the point where they were standing, and both former <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> shook the colonel's hand. `` This the guys wo n't believe,'' <PERSON> Spanos </PERSON> said, and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> commented: `` He put them in, we took them out. He was putting in the mines at night that we were taking out in the morning in the road. That was his specialty. He said he was good at it. We're glad we were good at our work or we would n't be meeting each other today.'' <PERSON> Thanh </PERSON> said: `` Both the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people and the <LOCATION> Vietnamese </LOCATION> people do n't like war. Now we talk. We do n't want to fight each other again. We want to be friends, not enemies.'' `` I do n't feel any bitterness,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` Some veterans may, probably some families who lost a son. If you look at the reality, these people were hurting as bad as we were. I hope nobody back in the States looks negatively on our visit here.'' It was a sad journey for the Marines in many ways, but there were light moments. At the government guest house in <LOCATION> Dong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ha </LOCATION> where the visitors stayed, children waited at the gate each day to cheer them as they left and again as they returned. When the Americans left their van to retrace their steps and reminisce at landmarks they remembered, scores of children followed as if the men were leading a parade. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, a 41-year-old farmer from <LOCATION> Langdon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, brought a photo of a Vietnamese woman and her infant son he snapped while building a road to <PERSON> Con </PERSON> <PERSON> Thien </PERSON>. He asked Col. <PERSON> Thanh </PERSON> if the woman was still around. She was. <PERSON> Thanh </PERSON> knew her well and led <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> and the others to her thatched-roof hut in <LOCATION> Chau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> village </LOCATION>, just off the dirt road. There, <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> was reunited with <PERSON> Hoan </PERSON> <PERSON> Thi </PERSON> <PERSON> Chit </PERSON>, 56, and her son, now 25. They smiled and posed for pictures and the son son put his arm around <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>. The American's biggest surprise, however, came as they left Mrs. Chit's home. <PERSON> Thanh </PERSON> told the former enemy she had been his top <PERSON> Viet </PERSON> <PERSON> Cong </PERSON> agent, and both men laughed.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today took some time away from the $ 25 million extravaganza marking his inauguration to try out his Oval Office chair and to get down to business, declaring that those holding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> will not gain any concessions from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. After opening the White House grounds to the public and leading about 15 people on a tour of his new home, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> invited his mother, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and some reporters into the Oval Office where he amplified some remarks included in his inaugural address Friday. Asked whether his plea Friday for assistance in the hostage matter was an extension of an olive branch to the hostage-holders, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I want to make clear to them that good will begets good will. ... `` We are not going to escalate the currency of holding Americans hostage. We are not going to have people feel that we are going to make concessions in order to free those precious lives,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. In his inaugural address, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had said of the hostages, `` There are today Americans who are held against their will in foreign lands, and Americans who are unaccounted for. Assistance can be shown here, and will be long remembered. Good will begets good will.'' The day started early, with yet another event marking the inauguration of the nation's 41st president: The White House grounds were opened to the public. `` This is the people's house and it does seem appropriate on this first day that we welcome as many as we can,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said after spending his first night at the White House. The doors opened at 8 a.m. to about 400 people who had waited through the night outside in temperatures that dropped to the 20s. It was the first `` open house'' at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 80 years, and organizers had expressed concern that the crowd touring the building would be more restrained than when <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> invited celebrators into the White House at his first inauguration in 1829 and they all but trashed the place. Those allowed inside went through the usual security checks, and once they got in the presidential mansion, they were jovial but still shivering from the cold they had endured. First Lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> joked about how early the tourists had to come to be the ones selected for the personalized tour, saying, `` They saw us come in last night.'' The Bushes had spent Friday night stopping in at each of the galas held to celebrate the inauguration, and had not gotten back to the White House until 12:45 a.m. Asked about her first night in the new home, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said it was comfortable, but `` too short.'' As <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> began his first full day as president, former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was back in his home state of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where he and wife <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> were settling into their new home in <ORGANIZATION> Bel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, near <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Speaking with reporters en route to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called the transfer of power a `` bittersweet experience.'' `` It was hard to say goodbye,'' he said, but he added that he was returning `` to a life we did love very much.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was equally nostalgic about taking over from the man he had served as vice president for two terms. `` I was trying to keep the tears from running down my cheeks. After eight years of friendship, it was pretty tough,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The Bushes made the round of black-tie, invitation-only inaugural balls into the night. Sixty-thousand Republican party faithful thronged from Union Station to the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on the banks of the moonlit <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> for a night of dancing and carousing. At Union Station, the Bushes took a turn on the dance floor, with the president joking: `` You saw it first here _ a lousy dancer trying to dance his first dance with the first lady of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' More partying was store for this evening, including a glitzy `` black tie and boots'' reception thrown by the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, then a less-formal dance party featuring performances by rock' n' roll and blues stars. But amid the festivities there was a grim reminder of the responsibilities that now rest squarely on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s shoulders. From the moment he was sworn in, a military aide was on call with a satchel containing the codes necessary to launch a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear attack. The satchel, which went to the Capitol with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and left with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, is never far away from the president. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today would begin `` the routine of being president'' with a national security briefing, and then would get in some paperwork. `` Nothing exciting, but certainly the important day-to-day routine,'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also would contact some of his Cabinet nominees, but that a formal Cabinet meeting is not scheduled until early next week. The new president plans to conduct some work on Sunday as well, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> took their oaths of office at midday Friday under a partly cloudy sky at the West Front of the Capitol in a ceremony watched by 200,000 people on the Capitol grounds and by millions more who saw it on television. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> delivered a 20-minute inaugural address that was marked more by lofty calls for national unity than for specific proposals. `` A new breeze is blowing _ and a nation refreshed by freedom stands ready to push on: there is new ground to be broken, and new action to be taken,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared. In his vow to devote new attention to the homeless, the disadvantaged, the forgotten and the drug-addicted, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also made an appeal for political reality in an era of $ 100 billion-plus deficits. `` We have more wallet than will; but will is what we needed,'' he said. The Republican president held out a symbolic hand to leaders of the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, urging compromise because Americans `` did not send us here to bicker.'' In his first official act as president, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed the nominations of his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> and other top-level members of his infant administration as well as a proclamation designating Sunday as a national day of prayer and thanksgiving. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> then went the 1.6 miles down <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> to the White House for the first time as chief executive, riding some of the way and walking some of the way, hand-in-hand with <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> at the head of his inaugural parade. Thousands of onlookers lined the route, including <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Brundage </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON> of suburban <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, who rode horses into the city and were rewarded with an unobstructed view. `` You have to be an <ORGANIZATION> NBA </ORGANIZATION> center to see over this crowd,'' <PERSON> Brundage </PERSON> said. Despite the months of preparation, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> showed some signs of still adjusting to his new status. At one point during his triumphant day, as he was bidding a final farewell to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had to nudge him to remind him that from now he is the one who answers to `` Mr. President.''

<TEXT>
 Radio stations broadcast the news 40 years ago Sunday to anxious <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> residents: the city's Nationalist officials had surrendered peacefully and a long Communist siege was over. She <LOCATION> Diqing </LOCATION>, now 71, remembers the day well. The announcement meant his imminent release from jail in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for his underground Communist work. Historian <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Huilin </PERSON> is less sure of the dates but remembers clearly getting the news. He and friends, then students, ran into the streets and sang songs of celebration. From a military standpoint, <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s surrender Jan. 22, 1949 was anticlimactic. After more than three years of civil war, the rest of northeastern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> already was in Communist hands. Communist troops had surrounded the ancient walled city since Dec. 13. Gen. <PERSON> Fu </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuoyi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> commander, had no line of retreat and no chance of relief from <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON>'s forces in the south. For <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s 2 million residents, the surrender meant the end to waiting and wondering whether the proud Fu, one of the Nationalists' most able generals, would choose to make a stand `` It was a very dismal, difficult time. We never knew whether there would be violence or not,'' <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Bodde </PERSON>, professor emeritus of Oriental studies at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Bodde </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> during the siege, busy translating a history of Chinese philosophy, and remembers filling his bathtub with water each day because water supplies often were cut. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, who in 1949 was a student at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and now teaches history there, remembers food supplies also were tight. `` Classes went on as usual. But everyone wanted a peaceful surrender. Aside from the possible loss of life, <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> held so many ancient relics that would have been destroyed in a battle,'' he said. The relics were part of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s mystique as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s capital for centuries. The Nationalists made their capital in <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION>, to the south, but the Communists planned to restore <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s status and did not want to destroy the city first. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> city officials have commemorated the fateful weeks in 1949 by issuing three books of photographs, reminiscences and documents. She, now retired from a top position in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s postwar government and a contributor to the books, recalled his work as an underground Communist organizer. Even before the siege began, he said, he sent envoys to persuade <PERSON> Fu </PERSON> to surrender, starting with <PERSON> Fu </PERSON>'s daughter, a member of the pro-Communist <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> that She headed. `` We feared that if we picked someone else to talk to Fu, he might be angry and kill the messenger,'' She said. `` But we figured if we picked his daughter, he might be unhappy but he would n't do anything.'' Several weeks later, She was arrested by Nationalist forces and spent the last 22 days before the surrender in jail. <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Rickett </PERSON>, then a student at <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Qinghua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> outside the city wall, watched events from a different perspective. Nationalist troops had set up an artillery unit on campus, said <PERSON> Rickett </PERSON>, now retired as a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>. `` But on the night of the 13th, the Nationalists withdrew and the Communist forces went past the university and set up their lines around <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>,'' he recalled in a phone conversation. The two sides dug into defensive positions in the arid winter landscape, trading occasional cannon volleys. <PERSON> Rickett </PERSON> said he crossed Communist and Nationalist lines twice to enter <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and found a city crowded with refugee students whom the Nationalists had evacuated from other cities. They camped in parks and ancient temples. `` The place was loaded with troops and trucks rushing around. There were a lot of accidents,'' he said. Soldiers patrolled the dark streets at night to enforce a curfew. `` You could n't see them and they could n't see you,'' <PERSON> Rickett </PERSON> said. `` I'd go along with a flashlight in my face to show I was a foreigner. Sometimes that got me by, sometimes I got yelled at.'' Fu, meanwhile, paced the floor of his study in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s former imperial palace and debated what to do, Major Gen. <PERSON> Zhou </PERSON> <PERSON> Beifeng </PERSON>, his former aide, wrote in the latest edition of Outlook Weekly magazine. <PERSON> Zhou </PERSON> said <PERSON> Fu </PERSON>'s hestitation lost him the chance to peacefully give up the nearby city of <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION>, which he also commanded. Communists finally attacked on Jan. 14, and history books say 130,000 defenders were killed. <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION>'s fall was the last straw. <PERSON> Fu </PERSON> surrendered a week later and the grateful Communists made him minister of conservation. He died in 1974.

 Despite scattered violence, millions of people voted in three federally-ruled states today in balloting that tested Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s popularity before national elections later this year. Officials suspended the voting in the state of <LOCATION> Nagaland </LOCATION> after clashes between rival groups left three people injured, election officials said. Authorities also reported minor clashes but no casualties in populous <LOCATION> Tamil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nadu </LOCATION>, an especially important state for <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s fortures Nevertheless, election officials reported heavy turnout in all three states after eight hours of voting for state assemblies came to a close. The voting will lead to a restoration of local rule. An estimated 75 percent of 600,000 eligible voters in <LOCATION> Nagaland </LOCATION> and about 75 percent of 300,000 eligible voters in <LOCATION> Mizoram </LOCATION> state cast ballots. An estimated 55 percent of 36 million eligible voters in <LOCATION> Tamil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nadu </LOCATION> went to the polls, the officials said. Results were expected to be released Sunday. The federal government imposed its own rule last year after political crises in <LOCATION> Mizoram </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nagaland </LOCATION>, sparsely populated northeastern states, and <LOCATION> Tamil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nadu </LOCATION> in the south. Indian law allows the federal government to dismiss a state government and impose its control if there is no clear majority in the legislature. A state may be kept under federal rule up to one year. Today's state assembly elections also were important for <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and his governing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> made nine trips across <LOCATION> Tamil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nadu </LOCATION> since September in an uphill battle to win a victory for his party. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, who must call national parliamentary elections by December, has been considering early elections if his party wins in <LOCATION> Tamil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nadu </LOCATION>. A loss, however, could rule out such a move and give the newly-formed opposition <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> nearly a year to organize. The new party is a coalition trying to unite behind V.P. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> ally who is planning to challenge the prime minister in the general election. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has enjoyed almost uninterrupted control of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> in the 41 years since independence, has not held power in <LOCATION> Tamil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nadu </LOCATION> since 1967. Pre-election opinion polls showed the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> trailing <PERSON> Muthuvel </PERSON> <PERSON> Karunanidhi </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Dravida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Munnetra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kazhagam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which was expected to win about 120 of the 234 state assembly seats. <PERSON> Karunanidhi </PERSON> is backed by <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Karunanidhi </PERSON> served as <LOCATION> Tamil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nadu </LOCATION> chief minister from 1967 to 1976 when he lost to M.G. <PERSON> Ramachandran </PERSON>, a popular actor who turned to politics. The Indian Constitution says the leader of the largest party should become prime minister. If he is not already sitting in the legislature, he must seek election within six months. <PERSON> Ramachandran </PERSON> ruled <LOCATION> Tamil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nadu </LOCATION> for 10 years until he died in December 1987. His death split his once-massive party into two factions _ one led by 64-year-old wife, <PERSON> Janaki </PERSON>, and the other by his leading lady on and off screen, <PERSON> Jayalalitha </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayaram </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Jayaram </PERSON>, 42, claims the late chief minister secretly married her and insists she is his political heir. She made the claim of the secret marriage after <PERSON> Ramachandran </PERSON> died. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s party has not designated anyone to be chief minister if it wins. Sixty seats were at stake in <LOCATION> Nagaland </LOCATION>, a remote hilly state bordering <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Forty seats were being contested in <LOCATION> Mizoram </LOCATION>. Both states have a history of insurgency and tribal unrest.

<HEAD>Pork Rinds Filled With Cholesterol, Salt And Fat, But President Loves

<TEXT>
 Pork rinds? They're loaded with cholesterol, salt and fat. But they crunch pleasingly and explode on the palate with delight before dissolving into a light, bacon-flavored residue. And President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> loves them. He was introduced to the crispy tan strips during his days as an oilman in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. After a tough day in the oil fields, pork rinds, washed down with a cold beer, seems like a food of kings _ or of presidents. So when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> for the political wars of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, he carried with him a continuing yen for them. But a diet laced with pork rinds, say nutrition experts, is bad news for a guy with a job like <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s. `` This is an appropriate snack for somebody who is doing a lot of manual labor _ an agricultural worker, a guy working on the chain gang, or building railroads,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Callaway </PERSON>, an associate clinical professor of nutrition at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Where they are burning up to 4,000 calories a day and sweating a lot, this would be fine.'' How about an executive who spends most of his time at the desk? `` As a general snack, it's not a good idea,'' he said in a recent interview. `` I think once a year would be fine.'' According to a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> analysis, a two-ounce package of pork rinds contains 315 calories; 32.5 grams of protein; 18.9 grams of fat; 58 milligrams of cholesterol, and 1,054 milligrams of sodium. In effect, a small package of the hog chips has 20 percent more calories, almost twice the fat and double the sodium of a typical fast-food hamburger. But the snack also has almost three times more protein than the burger. The fat, cholesterol and sodium, says <PERSON> Callaway </PERSON>, make pork rinds an unhealthy addition to a typical American diet that already is high in those elements. He said jelly beans, the treat preferred by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, are a much more healthy snack. `` On the other hand,'' <PERSON> Callaway </PERSON> added, `` if Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had a cholesterol of 165 ... and was otherwise healthy and was eating this stuff all day long, then I would n't make a big to do about it.'' According to his staff, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s cholesterol count is 192 _ well above the pork rind safety limit suggested by <PERSON> Callaway </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is so fond of the fried pig skin that in his primary campaign last April he stopped in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and met with the president of <ORGANIZATION> Rudolph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's top pork rind processors. `` He said he learned about -LRB- pork rinds -RRB- in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON>, the food company president. `` He told me, ` I eat the heck out of these things.''' But the president is not alone in his craving for fried hog hide. `` Pork rinds are a $ 200 million part of the $ 6 billion snack food market,'' said <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON>. `` They're just a little less popular than pretzels, but they're crawling ahead by 4 to 5 percent a year.'' <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON>'s company produces both the finished product and the partially-prepared `` pellet'' that other companies `` pop'' into the snack food. <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> believes pork rinds originated decades ago in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. He and his company modernized the technique and spent the last 33 years trying to sell the product to a skeptical world. Pork rinds start with raw, fresh hog hides delivered to the <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> plant. The skins are cut into one-inch squares and smoke-cured like bacon. Then they are rendered, a process that extracts grease and moisture and shrivels the strips into hard kernels called `` pellets.'' To `` pop'' the pellets into the final porcine delicacy, they are placed into oil heated to 400 degrees and deep fried. Finally, the rinds are salted _ generously _ and packaged, usually in two-ounce snack bags.

 Nearly a decade and a half after <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, a distraught former president beset by the past, flew home to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, another former president has followed in his path _ serene, popular and proclaiming that he looks to the future as he nears his 78th birthday. The contrasts between <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> were inescapable as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> flew west after <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inauguration Friday. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> declaring that it was `` very pleasant living'' in the White House but there are `` a lot of things yet to be done'' outside of it. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, driven to resignation by the Watergate scandal, took off by helicopter from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawn </LOCATION> of the White House on Aug. 9, 1974, and was aboard an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jet to his native state by the time <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> was sworn in to succeed him. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, whose own administration was plunged into turmoil by the Iran-Contra affair he professes not yet to understand, sat by benignly on the Capitol's western porch as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took the oath of office. Then he boarded a helicopter for the eight-minute flight to <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and the same jet trip west. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, born and raised in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, called his departure from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> `` the nightmare ending of a long dream.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, a Midwesterner who adopted <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> as his home, said the journey back there for him and former first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was `` a return to a life we did love very much.'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> went to an exile of seclusion and silence _ first in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, then in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, then in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> _ only recently emerging to proclaim his views in books, articles and public appearances. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he will quickly be `` out on the mash potato circuit'' pushing his proposals for budgetary and electoral reform. Asked what he would miss most about <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, he said, `` I have n't tried -LRB- thinking about -RRB- that; it was very pleasant living there ...'' As to what they would like most about their new life, he said, `` Well, because it will be a return to a life we did love very much. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is n't a place in my mind, it's a way of life, so that is the sweet part of the bittersweet experience.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> often conferred with <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> while in office and once said that as fellow Californians they had a `` closer bond'' than he enjoyed with former presidents <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> or <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>. Nevertheless the two men's attitudes toward past and future seem to differ greatly. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, 61 when he left office, asked diplomat <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> some months later, `` What did I do wrong?'' If there is any such soul searching in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, he does not show it. The circumstances of his departure as the first president since <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> to complete two terms are, of course, immeasurably happier. Still, the stark contrasts stand out. In his farewell to his staff in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Room </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said, `` Always remember, others may hate you _ but those who hate you do n't win, unless you hate them.'' In <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s East Room farewell, as in <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s, there were tears aplenty. But no talk of hate. On his helicopter flight to <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> leaned his head back against his seat back and closed his eyes and heard his wife, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON>, murmur, `` It's so sad. It's so sad.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, asked as he jetted back west if he was sad, happy or relieved, replied, `` There are elements of all that, yes.''

 <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s grisly sex crimes 11 years ago galvanized support for the death penalty in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and left their mark on the political landscape. `` There'll be a celebration when he dies,'' said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Witt </PERSON>, mayor of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> community of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, home of <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s final victim, 12-yearold <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> `` He has such a terrible criminal record, it's just impossible to have any sympathy for him.'' Although <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s scheduled execution Tuesday is for <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON>'s 1978 murder, he also received a death sentence for strangling two students in their beds in a 1978 rampage at a <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> sorority house in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> Two other women were critically injured. The law school dropout also was suspected in the sex-related deaths of up to three dozen women in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. As his execution date approached, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> began confessing to some of those slayings, said a prosecutor who befriended him. `` Murders are being solved,'' <LOCATION> Volusia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> State Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orlando </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sentinel </ORGANIZATION> late Friday. At a 1987 competency hearing, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> called <LOCATION> Bundy </LOCATION> `` probably the most competent serial killer in the country at this time ... a diabolical genius.'' `` This is not one of those cases where death penalty opponents are going to have much luck rallying public sympathy to their cause,'' said <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>, spokesman for Republican Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. `` We have not heard from <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> for a change.'' <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> became part of the state's 1986 gubernatorial race when a hard-hitting television commercial for <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said Democrat <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Pajcic </PERSON> `` voted to weaken the death penalty for killers like <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>.'' Although some found the commercial distasteful, its effects were devastating to <PERSON> Pajcic </PERSON>, who lost the election largely on the law-and-order issue. `` It is an issue that resonates very deeply in this state,'' <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, a political science professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>, said during the campaign. `` Everybody knows who <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> is.'' Political experts generally agreed that Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' presidential aspirations also were crippled in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> by his opposition to the death penalty <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> received just 38 percent of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> vote in November. State officials and death penalty supporters complain that <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> escaped three earlier death warrants through legal maneuverings. On one of those occasions, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, 42, whose case was depicted in the TV miniseries `` The Deliberate Stranger,'' came within seven hours of execution Nov. 17, 1986, before a federal appeals court ordered a competency hearing. `` That man has been living off the taxpayers for 10, 11 years, and it reflects badly on the judicial system,'' the mayor said. `` People begin to wonder if there is such a thing as criminal justice any longer because of so many postponements.'' When the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> passed a law in 1986 requiring automobile passengers to buckle their seat belts, hordes of bumper stickers appeared that read: `` I'll Buckle Up When Bundy Does _ It's the Law.'' `` It makes a mockery of our judicial system every day that <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> continues to live,'' said State Attorney <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, who won a conviction in the <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> case. `` People are virtually up in arms about this, and every day that justice is delayed, justice is either denied or at least diminished.'' Nineteen people have been executed in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> since the death penalty was restored in 1976, but none has attracted as much attention as <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>. Hundreds of calls have poured in from editors and reporters from around the country who want to cover the execution. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> has received scores of calls from people hoping to land one of a dozen seats available to the public for witnessing the execution. `` We've had an average of 30 calls a day from people wanting to be witnesses,'' said <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Flack </PERSON>, an administrative assistant. `` There is no comparison. We normally get three or four requests on an individual inmate, normally from law enforcement.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is refusing to unseal a 26-year-old correspondence between President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> concerning the Cuban missile crisis, despite requests from scholars who say officials in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> are `` thrilled'' by the idea. The 11 classified letters exchanged in 1962 following the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> confrontation remain `` extremely sensitive ... from the national security point of view,'' said <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> of the department's freedom of information office Scholars had hoped for the release of the letters in time for a conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> next weekend featuring for the first time _ and most likely the last _ missile crisis participants from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` There'll never be a group able to discuss these letters like this group ever again,'' scholar <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blight </PERSON> said in a telephone interview last week. `` Some of the co-authors of these letters will be in the room,'' said <PERSON> Blight </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION>. He said scholars are anxious to learn `` what was said so often and so deeply felt, because this was supposed to be regarded by both men as absolutely private.'' The missile crisis flared in October 1962 when an American U-2 spy plane spotted construction of Soviet medium-range ballistic missile sites in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> responded with a naval blockade. Many believe the confrontation brought the superpowers to the brink of war. It ended when <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> agreed to remove the missiles in exchange for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> guarantees that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> would not be invaded. Blight, who recently published a book on the missile crisis and helped set up the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> conference, said Soviet leaders were enthusiastic about the idea of releasing the letters. `` The Soviets were thrilled by this idea,'' <PERSON> Blight </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` absolutely would have gone along with it,'' he said. `` There's no doubt in my mind.'' <PERSON> Aleksander </PERSON> <PERSON> Alekseev </PERSON>, Soviet ambassador to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> at the time of the crisis, urged <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leaders to allow release of the letters. Other `` people very close to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'' also embraced the idea, he said. But <PERSON> Blight </PERSON> said the Soviets would not release the correspondence without the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> approval. The <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, spurred by researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> who helped set up the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> conference, requested in November that all 11 documents be reviewed for release. Previous requests by the library on behalf of individual scholars have been rejected. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has not announced its decision to the school or library. But <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., in a letter and a telephone conversation last month that the documents would remain sealed <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had been working on behalf of the school to have the documents declassified. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> said discussions between <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and the senator were private and that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> would not release his correspondence with the secretary of state. The world leaders exchanged 22 letters between Oct. 22 and Dec. 14 concerning the missile crisis, according to <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>, an archivist at the Kennedy Library in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Ten of the letters were declassified in 1973 by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the 11th was released in 1979, she said. The remaining letters, written by both men from Oct. 30 through Dec. 14, have remained sealed at the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> library despite periodic requests by the library on behalf of scholars to have them released. Blight expressed skepticism about the `` national security'' reason for keeping the letters classified. `` The Americans who saw it at the time say there's nothing embarrassing -LRB- and poses -RRB- no national security risks,'' said Blight. He said the reason may be that world leaders may be reluctant to have frank correspondence if they fear the documents might be released later. Blight also suggested that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> may fear setting a precedent. `` Rather than the -LRB- missile crisis -RRB- correspondence being the problem, it would be the precedent of opening up sensitive material related to the U.S.-Cuban-Soviet relationship as a continuing problem,'' he said.

 A 16-year-old who told authorities he was forced to chauffeur two prison escapees on an 11-day crime spree says the 4,000-mile odyssey taught him how to protect himself from being a victim again. `` I've learned how criminals look at the world. They look for people who are by themselves, who flaunt things,'' <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> said as he returned to school Friday for the first time since he disappeared Jan. 3. He also learned how to navigate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where he said the three got lost in a snowstorm and walked 80 blocks trying to find his car. `` I'd never driven in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> said. `` You've got to watch out for the taxis.'' <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> told investigators that <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Paige </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Ocala </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cokley </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, forced him to drive them up and down the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> because neither knew how to drive his stick-shift car. <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> disappeared near his family's <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> horse farm Jan. 3, the same morning <PERSON> Paige </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cokley </PERSON> escaped from the <ORGANIZATION> Marion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Lowell </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> was released in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> on Jan. 14 after the two men bought a used car, with an automatic transmission, with money from six burglaries and three strong-arm robberies, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. The escapees were arrested Wednesday near <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and on Friday a federal magistrate in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> ordered them returned to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> for a preliminary hearing on federal escape, kidnapping and auto theft charges. <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> is glad the experience is over. `` I just want to get this all behind me,'' he said. `` Maybe someday I'll write a book about this whole experience.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, getting swiftly down to work, sent a fresh signal today to the powers holding nine Americans captive in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, suggesting that the hostages' release would engender a comparable act of good will from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The new president greeted tourists visiting the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, sent a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> asking to address a joint session on Feb. 9, welcomed a letter of congratulations from the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> and met with reporters during his first visit to the Oval Office. With his mother, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, seated at his side, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he hoped a plea for assistance in the hostage matter in his inaugural speech `` was heard around the world.'' `` I want to make clear to them that good will begets good will,'' he said when asked whether he was extending an olive branch to the hostage-holders. His comment echoed what he said Friday in his inaugural address in a clear appeal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for help: `` There are today Americans who are held against their will in foreign lands and Americans who are unaccoaunted for. Assistance can be shown here, and will be long remembered. Good will begets good will. Good faith can be a spiral that endlessly moves on.'' At the same time, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not make concessions in an effort to free the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages, some held for nearly four years. Refusing to indicate that any <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> nation was responsible for holding the hostages, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` We keep hearing rumors that countries want to have improved relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But you ca n't finger any one country for holding hostages agaisnt their will.'' He added: `` We are not going to escalate the currency of holding Americans hostage. We are not going to have people feel that we are going to make concessions in order to free those precious lives.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he planned to respond to `` a generous letter'' from Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> letter was handed to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Capitol Hill shortly after his swearing-in ceremony. In it, the Soviet leader told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that the two superpowers have a chance to `` bring closer the solution of the most painful problems of the present time, above all those connected with the need to eliminate the threat of war.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> congratulated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on his new job and said he hoped that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s tenure `` will be marked by the stable and diverse development of relations between our countries'' and added that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` is prepared to work in this direction.'' Later in the morning, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sent a letter to the bipartisan leadership of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, inviting them to meet with him Tuesday at the White House to discuss the nation's deficit and its foreign policy. He asked for the opportunity to address a joint session of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday, Feb. 9. `` Let me say how much I look forward to our working together on these critical issues,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wrote, according to a text released by the White House. `` I am sure the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people expect that conserns of such national import should be tackled in a spirit of bipartisan cooperation, and am hopeful that we may prove worthy of the confidence they place in us.'' Asked for his reaction to being in the Oval Office for the first time, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> grinned and said, `` It's wonderful. I ca n't wait to get to work. I really feels wonderful.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also read the note that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had left him for in his Oval Office desk, handwritten on a notepad with the inscription, `` Do n't let the turkeys get you down. `` You'll have moments when you'll want to use this particular stationary, well, go to it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as writing. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also marked his first full day in office by welcoming <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to `` the people's house,'' opening the grounds of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and leading a tour for a few of the many who were waiting in the icy morning chill. The president, with first lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at his side, came outside below the south porch of the White House _ not usually a tourist entrance _ to welcome about 400 people waiting for a free public tour of the presidential mansion. `` This is the people's house and it does seem appropriate on this first day that we welcome as many as we can,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. While thousands more people waited their turns to enter the White House grounds, a randomly selected group of about 15 visitors was personally escorted by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on a tour of the historic house. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> left the tour, saying he had to begin some presidential paperwork, `` to sign one or two things.'' Dozens of people waited outside the White House grounds most of the night for the public tour, which came after the Bushes had a busy evening of inaugural ball-hopping. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took the oath of office at noon Friday in a chilly ceremony watched by 200,000 on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and by millions of television viewers around the world. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was also attending a lunch at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> honoring the finance committee that raised more than $ 25 million for these inaugural festivities, and was heading out again tonight to a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> `` Black Tie and Boots'' party and another affair for young Americans. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has often joked that he has <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Buren </PERSON> to thank for his example of being the last vice president elected directly to the presidency, may have <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Buren </PERSON> to blame for the black tie ordeal he endured Friday night. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Buren </PERSON> in 1837 became the first chief executive to hold two inaugural balls, and he offended supporters by only attending the higher-priced affair. Since then, no president has passed up any official ball, even as they mushroomed from five in <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s time to nine at <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s second inauguration. This time, there were 11 official balls, with separate overflow balls at three sites, and a stop at a Congressional Medal of Honor winners' banquet, making 15 stops in all for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made no bones that dancing is not his favorite pastime. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who began the eventful day by rising at 6 a.m. in <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, did n't get home to the White House until 12:45 a.m., more than 4 -LCB- hours after he and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> began the party rounds. They danced cheek-to-cheek at five balls, but although the bands played `` I Could Have Danced All Night,'' they never did more than a few turns.

<HEAD>West Germany Pulls Diplomats From Kabul; Soviet Airlifts Reported</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s diplomatic staff left <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on Saturday under orders from the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> government, and <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> began an airlift of emergency food supplies to this beleaguered capital. The West German <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said it told its three diplomats in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to leave because of fears of worsening economic conditions and increased violence as Soviet soldiers leave <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and its civil war. <PERSON> Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Chrobog </PERSON>, chief ministry spokesman, said the diplomats and their families left the city Saturday. He said the embassy would function `` on a reduced status'' with a small local staff. Western diplomatic sources in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, however, said the embassy was closed. That would make it the first foreign mission in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to shut down amid concerns about an economic blockade and possible blood bath following the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s departure. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the West Germans left on a flight for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> with no prior announcement. `` We intend to watch developments there carefully before making a decision on when to return,'' <PERSON> Chrobog </PERSON> said. Other Western embassies say they are reviewing their positions now that it appears the Soviets will meet a Feb. 15 deadline for removal of their troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, where they have been helping government troops fight Moslem guerrillas since December 1979. The British Embassy last week told Britons and nationals of six other countries for which it has diplomatic responsibility to leave. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> has 11 American staff members in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and says the question of whether to stay is `` under constant review.'' <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> has been increasingly tense as the withdrawal date for the remaining 50,000 Soviet soldiers approaches and guerrillas close in. Food prices have doubled in recent weeks. Civilians, including young children, stand in bread lines for hours in 20-degree temperatures. Guerrilla disruptions of convoys of food and supplies, including ammunition, have increased as Soviet troops hand over escort duties and positions to government units along the key <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> highway from the Soviet border. Bad weather also has held up convoys. Saturday's English-language <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> report mentioned `` significant shortages because of the effort by the unreconcilable opposition -LRB- guerrillas -RRB- to organize an economic blockade of the city.'' It accused some <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> traders of engaging in `` open sabotage'' by hoarding food. The official Soviet news agency reported from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> that a 3,500-ton airlift of food began Friday. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said six flights arrived Saturday in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> with flour and other food supplies. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> aid officials welcomed the reported airlift and urged similar help from Western nations, which refuse to deal with the pro-Marxist government of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. `` We're very pleased. This is a beginning,'' said <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. `` We've heard reports of children dying -LRB- from cold -RRB- in the bread queues and we're very concerned about the dangers of increased malnutrition ... This is a humanitarian, not a political issue, and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> should help too.''

 A local <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> official, who has criticized <ORGANIZATION> Arsenio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> for failing to hire more blacks for his new late-night talk show, has filed a $ 10 million libel suit against the black actor-comedian. <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, president of the <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills-Hollywood </PERSON> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, claimed in the lawsuit filed Friday in <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> defamed him by accusing him of extortion during a radio talk show earlier this month. According to <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>' lawsuit, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> claimed <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> had sought $ 40,000 to prevent him from publicizing <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s alleged failure to hire black writers, directors or producers for his new syndicated show, `` The Arsenio Hall Show.'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s comments were `` for the sole purposes of defaming <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>' lawsuit alleges. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachs </PERSON>, a Hall manager, declined to comment on the lawsuit. He said his client, who formerly was a guest host of <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Late Show,'' had not been served with the legal papers. The Beverly Hills-Hollywood <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> also has criticized <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Richie </PERSON> on similar grounds, saying the black singers employed few blacks in administrative positions on their staffs.

The last half-hour of <PERSON> Sajak </PERSON>'s show competes against `` Late Night With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'' on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sajak </PERSON> got a first-week rating of 5.3 and a share of 21 percent of the audience for all 90 minutes.

<HEAD>British Conduct in Palestine Alarmed Government 50 Years Ago</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 British officials frequently expressed alarm at their security forces' behavior during an Arab rebellion in <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> 50 years ago, but they did little to curb the excesses, newly declassified documents show. The Independent newspaper, which sifted through the government files, said Saturday they showed `` ministers refused to curb the atrocities and excesses ... _ the very charge now leveled against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> by the present British government.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said he did not expect the department to comment because, `` That is history and it's for the historians to decide.'' One tactic was to force Arab cabdrivers to ride at the head of British convoys in case the road was mined, the Independent said. A note from Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuckburgh </PERSON>, a senior government official at the time, was quoted as likening conditions in <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> to what the British faced against <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> rebels 20 years earlier. `` We have to deal not with a chivalrous opponent playing the game according to the rules, but with gangsters and murderers,'' <PERSON> Shuckburgh </PERSON> wrote. This followed the assassination of a British official in the town of <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION> and the shooting death of the suspected assassin, allegedly as he tried to escape after being arrested. A heavily armed convoy set out for <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION>, in what is now the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, carrying 9,300 pounds of the explosive gelignite and orders that `` a large portion of the town should be blown up,'' according to a commander's report dated Sept. 5, 1938. Demolishing homes is one of the penalties <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has used during the 13-month-old Palestinian rebellion in the occupied territories. It inherited this and other tactics from the British, who ruled <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> from 1917 until <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> won statehood in 1948. What particularly alarmed <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the Independent said, was security forces' use of `` mine-sweeping taxis.'' Known troublemakers owned the taxis, which were commandeered with their drivers and put at the heads of convoys, the papers said. Lord Dufferin of <PERSON> Ava </PERSON>, parliamentary undersecretary at the <ORGANIZATION> Colonial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, wrote: `` Much as I dislike the implications of the ` mine-sweeping taxi,' I do not feel that we have the right to interfere. British lives are being lost and I do n't think we, from the security of <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION>, can protest squeamishly about measures taken by the men in the front line.'' Let's `` close our eyes,'' he recommended to the government in a letter endorsed by other officials. A letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Colonial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> from the British High Commissioner in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, Sir <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> MacMichael </PERSON>, shared a concern that the British were using `` Black and Tan tactics'' _ a reference to atrocities committed by the Black and <PERSON> Tan </PERSON> units of <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> military police in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> in 1920 and 1921. `` One recognizes that when men see their friends and comrades ... blown into pieces by a land mine they are apt to ` see red''' he wrote. `` But there are limits which must not be passed.'' The Independent said the papers contain `` no evidence of firm government action to demand discipline and adherence to publicly stated orders.'' Many of the documents should have been made public in 1969 but were withheld for an additional 20 years because of their sensitivity, the Independent said.

 Two black policemen and a civilian were shot to death in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> by assailants using an automatic rifle, police said Saturday. A third policeman suffered a bullet wound in the chest and was hospitalized in serious but stable condition after the attack late Friday in the huge township outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, police said. The civilian was described as a 45-year-old black man who happened to be in the area at the time of the attack. None of the victims' names was released. Police said the attackers used a Soviet-made AK-47 rifle. No arrests were reported, and the police statement did not suggest a possible motive for the attack. Black policemen have been frequent targets of attacks by guerrillas and anti-apartheid militants who consider them collaborators with the white-led government.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> begins his presidency awash in political good will for the moment but strapped in the long run by the legacy of debt from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. The trick is to jump start his term without any money. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been trying to dampen expectations of a dazzling new start, perhaps hoping to insure that any early achievements seem larger than life. Dismissing the notion of a dramatic first 100 days, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in an inauguration-eve interview, `` I'm not shooting for any 100 days. And I think it's kind of a concept that does n't really apply.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is guaranteed of making a splash, though, just by comparison with the way <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did things. There will be plenty of differences to highlight _ many of them that will depict <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as a busy, hands-on manager in contrast to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s laid-back style. A late sleeper, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> never got to work before 9 a.m. On his first day, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was on the move at 8 a.m., leading a tour of the White House for selected tourists. On regular work days, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to be in the Oval Office between 7 a.m. and 7:30 a.m. In public and private appearances, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> relied heavily on prepared scripts and `` talking points'' written on file cards. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is more comfortable speaking off the cuff, though he, too, depends on speech writers to write formal remarks. Where <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s schedule was carefully choreographed, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is spontaneous and often unpredictable. While <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> consented to always be accompanied by the press, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he wo n't wait around for reporters and will come and go as he pleases. `` You just do n't want to be totally isolated,'' he said There will be a big emphasis on family and children in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> White House. He has four grown sons and a daughter and 10 grandchildren who will be frequent visitors. In contrast, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> were often estranged from their family. While <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was not fond of traveling overseas, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> loves it, making 40 separate foreign trips and visiting 74 nations since 1981. He'll go to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> for the Feb. 24 funeral of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> and has not ruled out other stops on that trip. A <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> is likely in April, and an economic summit in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> is set for July. As <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> flew into retirement on Friday, he acknowledged, `` I think there are a lot of things yet to be done. ... Certainly a change with regard to the abortion situation _ -LRB- I -RRB- could n't get that done yet.'' He also mentioned his futile efforts to get authority for line-item vetoes on the budget and to win passage of a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget. For <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the realities of the deficit loom over everything else on the domestic agenda. On Monday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will have his first Cabinet meeting and the budget is sure to be Topic A. On Tuesday, he wants to meet at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> with the bipartisan leadership of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to open talks on the $ 150 billion budget deficit bequeathed by <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. On Feb. 9, he will address a joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to announce his budget priorities. For now, at least, congressional Democrats are treating <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> warmly. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is extending the hand of friendship and we intend to extend ours in return,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>. Former House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> `` Tip'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, who led the Democrats' budget battles with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, exulted, `` It's the dawn of a new era. We're back to normalcy in the White House. How delighted I am.'' No one expects the honeymoon with a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to last forever, and some think it will end sooner than later. `` The Hill is stacked against them. It will give this administration little or no slack,'' said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s former political adviser, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>. `` The Hill will treat this as an extension of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration.'' Already the deficit has forced <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to scale back on education initiatives and other plans. `` Our funds are low,'' he said in his inaugural address. `` We have a deficit to bring down. We have more will than wallet; but will is what we need.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in an interview, said, `` We'll have to sort through and set priorities. Some of what I want to do will have to wait on a solution to the budget question.'' While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his lieutenants are hanging tough, polls show that a majority of Americans doubt that the new president will be able to live up to his promise not to raise taxes. He has to find billions of dollars for the savings and loan industry crisis, the cleanup and repair of the nation's nuclear weapon plants and other costly problems. There also are vexing national security and foreign policy problems. For the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has to decide on a scaled-down budget and choose between two strategic weapon systems, the MX missile or the Midgetman. He plans to order a major reassessment of how to deal with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on arms control and other areas. The Middle East and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> also demand immediate attention.

<HEAD>Cleric Says Release of Britons `Imminent' But U.S. Must Make Concessions</HEAD>

 A Shiite Moslem cleric said in an interview published Saturday there are signs British hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> will be freed soon but that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> captives wo n't go free until the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> makes concessions. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Saturday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would make no concessions to free the hostages. `` We are not going to escalate the currency of holding Americans hostage,'' he said. The fundamentalist cleric, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousawi </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should meet Iranian conditions for freeing the American hostages, according to the interview published by the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> magazine An-Nahar Arab and International. The magazine quoted <PERSON> Mousawi </PERSON> as saying, `` I would like to assert that there are good indications of an imminent release of the British hostages as a result of the Iranian-British rapprochement.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> agreed Dec. 9 to restore full diplomatic ties, ending a 19-month break that followed the arrest of an Iranian diplomat in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> on shoplifting charges. Three Britons are among the 15 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. They are Anglican church envoy <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, who disappeared Jan. 20, 1987; journalist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, kidnapped April 17, 1986; and educator <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>, a dual British-Irish national abducted April 11, 1986. Also missing is <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Collett </PERSON>, a British journalist who was working for the U.N. Relief and Works agency when he disappeared March 25, 1985. An Islamic group claims to have killed him, but no body was found. <PERSON> Mousawi </PERSON> heads a small group called The <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, which seeks to set up an Islamic republic in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> patterned after the Iranian regime of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mousawi </PERSON>'s group is allied with the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, an umbrella organization for pro-Iranian factions believed holding most of the hostages. The magazine quoted <PERSON> Mousawi </PERSON> as saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would have to make concessions to win freedom for the nine American hostages. `` If <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> wants its hostages, then it has to respond to the Iranian demands so that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would give the advice -LRB- to the hostage holders -RRB- to free the American hostages,'' he said. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> has demanded release of $ 10 billion in Iranian assets frozen in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a precondition for its aid in releasing the American hostages. The American captives include <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who is the foreigner held longest in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985. <PERSON> Mousawi </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> could exert influence on the captors, even though the kidnappings were ordered by `` Lebanese personalities'' and carried out by <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> without intervention from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. He added, `` But it is normal for any Moslem irrespective of how far he is geographically from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to be influenced by the advice of the officials in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, looking ahead Saturday to his first days in office, said he will quickly answer a peace missive from Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and seek an early bipartisan foreign policy relationship with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. A letter <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> received from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> through emissaries during his inauguration ceremonies Friday congratulated him and offered hopes for `` stable and diverse development of relations between our countries, so important for peace throughout the world.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters that he would respond to the letter, which he characterized as `` generous ... pledging world peace.'' He said he had received other `` heartwarming'' expressions of good will from leaders around the world and will respond to them as well. Taking questions from reporters as he sat at his Oval Office desk during his first day on the job, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not make concessions in an effort to free the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He said he hopes his inaugural plea for help from other countries on the hostage matter will be heard worldwide. `` I want to make clear to them that good will begets good will,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> indicated he has several things on his mind as he prepares to begin his presidency, and said he could n't wait to get started. A first formal meeting of his cabinet is set for Monday. On Tuesday he will meet with a bipartisan group of congressional leaders on the budget deficit and on foreign affairs, according to chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides have indicated there will be an ethics-in-government package and he is expected to name an advisory commission on ethics, with that coming within a matter of days, according to <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said he expected <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to make a statement to coincide with Monday's anti-abortion demonstration in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to mark the anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION> Roe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> V. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision legalizing abortion. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he opposes abortion except in cases of rape, incest or a threat to the life of the mother, although in earlier years he espoused a more flexible view. The president sent a letter Saturday to congressional leaders formally asking to address a joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 9. Forseeing battles over his vow not to raise taxes, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> acknowledged many on Capitol Hill `` wo n't accept some of the fundamental premises on which I was elected.'' `` I'm not expecting miracles, but I want them to know we are going to try,'' he said in remarks to a group of Republican financial backers Saturday afternoon. Earlier <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters that despite his overtures to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, he also has concerns `` about the erosion of presidential power'' in which the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> often are able to thwart presidential initiatives. He said he wants to discuss that with members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> how `` to reestablish in the presidency the firm hand that I think the Constitution gave the president.'' Regarding the hostages, he said, `` We keep hearing rumors that countries want to have improved relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But you ca n't finger any one country for holding hostages against their will.'' `` We are not going to escalate the currency of holding Americans hostage. We are not going to have people feel that we are going to make concessions in order to free those precious lives,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> displayed an upbeat and eager demeanor Saturday, the day after he was sworn in as the 41st president. `` I ca n't wait to get to work. I mean, serious work,'' he told reporters in the Oval Office. `` I could n't wait to come over here this morning.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> began his day Saturday by leading an open house for members of the public to tour the White House, personally taking a group of about two dozen of the first arrivals through the mansion's public rooms. He also spent time with Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> and met with <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> and National Security Adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, and took a moment to stroll on the White House grounds and tennis court with his children and grandchildren.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> admitted Saturday with a sheepish grin that he got lost wandering around on his first night in the White House but vowed to `` get to work ... serious work'' on his first day in the Oval Office. `` I could n't wait to get in here ... It's wonderful,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, seated before a crackling fire with his mother, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, by his side. `` Oh, I think it's the most exciting day of my life _ so far!'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was seated in the traditional chair reserved for visiting heads of state and dignitaries when they visit the president. From around 8 a.m. when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> popped his head out of a second-floor window to wave to tourists, the new president started a first day that had its hectic moments. Several dozen inaugural week visitors toured the mansion's ceremonial rooms and caused more commotion than the White House has seen in years. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ clad in a suit and sweater against the January chill _ led several dozen members of his family on an impromptu tour of the South Lawn and tennis court, capping the stroll by tossing a footfall with his sons. Then the new president joined about 240 of his family members for lunch in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Room </LOCATION>. Shortly before 9 a.m., <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> strolled across the colonnade and entered the Oval Office, stealing a few private moments with the matriarch of his family. Even at that hour, he already had put his stamp on the office _ several pens were neatly arranged on a gilt plate on his desk, accompanied by a letter holder and a trio of books. Pictures of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> family members in plastic frames crowded the table behind his ornate wooden desk. As he chatted amiably with reporters, the president sipped coffee from a green and gold cup emblazoned with the eagle of the presidential seal. A somber portrait of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> in full dress uniform looked down upon the nation's 41st president. A dark bronze bust of <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> played sentry by a side door. Asked how he felt on his first visit to the office, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` It feels just fine,'' noting that his large family was `` settling in ... after the glamor and excitement of the inauguration.'' `` I ca n't wait to get to work ... serious work. And we're going to do some here today,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He said he has `` a good full schedule'' for next week. `` I got lost in the White House yesterday evening when we came in, trying to find a couple of kids rooms,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> admitted when asked about his first night in the mansion. As his mother beamed, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reached over and patted her on the knee. `` This is the one who told me not to brag about myself and to bend my knees when I volleyed,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cracked. The president said he began his day around 6 a.m., caring for a sick grandchild, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBlond </PERSON>, and that the recovery was rapid _ `` Pumped a half a Tylenol into her and she's looking good. Ate two pancakes.'' Asked about the note President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> left for him on Friday before leaving the office, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told an aide to pull it from the desk drawer. Holding high a notepad with the inscription, `` Do n't let the turkeys get you down,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> showed reporters how <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had written his successor he'd `` have moments when you'll want to use this particular stationary. Well, go to it.'' `` You'll be in my prayers. God bless you and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>. I'll miss our Thursday lunches,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as saying in the note. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also touched on matters of policy ranging from U.S.-Soviet relations to relations with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He told reporters that `` the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will stay strong'' and that occasionally presidents are called upon to use force. `` This president will be no different,'' he vowed. He went on to muse about the limits of presidential power and said he intended to work with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` not only to avoid the erosion of power but to re-establish ... the firm hand that I think the Constitution gave the president.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has vowed not to answer questions in the so-called `` photo opportunities'' set up by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, insisted that his 17-minute session with reporters and photographers `` is not a phot op.'' `` I love it when it's tranquil and peaceful like this,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the assembled reporters and photographers as the cameras clicked and the reporters asked questions.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opened the White House doors Saturday to a band of shivering pilgrims _ some in tuxedos and others wrapped in quilts _ who had waited outside all night for a chance to greet him in his new home. `` I've been here 11 hours and 30 minutes. It's cold,'' said <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Shadix </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> when the White House east gate was finally unlocked shortly after 7 a.m. Cheers and occasional shouts of `` Where's <PERSON> George </PERSON>?'' came from the long line of bundled-up people clutching sleeping bags, quilts and blankets as they streamed into a security area to walk through metal detectors. `` One of the highlights of the tour is heat,'' Secret Service Agent <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludtke </PERSON> joked as the crowd moved out of the 24-degree chill and into the historic house. The White House American Welcome, billed as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first official act as president and as the first White House open house in 80 years, prompted dozens of people to sleep out overnight to make sure they were admitted. More than 4,000 visitors took the free tours as part of the three-hour open house. What made the event different from the regular Saturday tours was that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife were on hand to greet many of the visitors. Inauguration officials said a new president had not made such a planned, formal gesture since 1909. The earliest arrivals showed up at 8:30 p.m. Friday, and the long vigil paid off for 15 people chosen to tour the White House with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>. `` The president actually stood beside me and nudged me and said ` what do you think of this room?''' said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, 52, of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. `` I said, ` It's beautiful.' He paused and laughed incredulously. `` I never thought it would happen. I never thought he'd even be there. It's something I'll never forget I will never be that close a president again.'' It was barely light in the south courtyard of the White House when the first visitors were allowed in, but the mood was festive. The Truman Balcony was hung with red, white and blue bunting, and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marine Band pianist sent cocktail music wafting across the lawn. College students and senior citizens and parents lugging children in snowsuits shouted `` We love you George'' as the first couple strode out to make brief remarks. `` I know some of you have been up all night long,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told about 1,500 patient fans. `` We just wanted to wish you well and welcome you to the people's house.'' Those on the personal tour were a mix of students, older people and families, all among the first to arrive Friday night. Also picked was a double amputee in a wheelchair. The Bushes, accompanied by a curator, led the small group through several ceremonial rooms, the same ones shown on normal White House tours. `` It was just great. He was the kindest man. I was n't expecting him to get up so early,'' said <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Slater </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Slater </PERSON>, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Resnick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON>, three <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students, earned their presidential tour by being the very first in line. The president, they said, was as nice as they had expected. `` He treated us like we were real people _ not like rabble,'' <PERSON> Resnick </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Scotch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said in amazement. What next? `` I'm going to call my parents,'' said <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Manalapan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION> The decorous tour was a far cry from <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s inaugural open house in 1829. Muddy-booted men stepped on chairs and knocked over furniture and glassware to get at the refreshments, which were later moved onto the lawn in hopes the unruly crowd would follow. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> ended up cornered by the mob and had to be spirited out the back door. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> held the most recent open house, shaking visitors' hands for hours the day after his inauguration in 1909. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife continued that tradition Saturday after their stint as escorts, greeting hundreds more people with handshakes and chitchat before leaving for other engagements. `` It was well worth not sleeping,'' said <PERSON> Claudine </PERSON> <PERSON> Fortunato </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` He's got a nice firm handshake, he really does,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` It was n't an assembly line. He looked me in the eye and said thanks for coming by. It was completely worth waiting for,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> was among several men attired in tuxedos, telltale evidence that they had come straight from Friday night inaugural balls to camp outside the White House. Commenting on the phenomenon later, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had shaken hands with people who `` had been to one of these balls and ... slept out there.'' `` Now what does it take for somebody to stay awake all night to come into the White House?'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> mused. `` What kind of people were they? They were all different kinds of people ... The common thread was that they felt they were lucky to be there, which amazed me in a sense because I felt we were so lucky to have people that would care that much.''

<HEAD>Homemakers Say They'll Protest Scarcity of Goods</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group of homemakers said Saturday they will protest at government offices because of a shortage of goods that has created a wave of panic buying and put the government at odds with manufacturers. `` There's no coffee, toilet paper or detergent. There has n't been all week. It's been crazy,'' said <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Rumbos </PERSON>, a supermarket clerk in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>. He was describing a wave of panic shopping after a group of companies announced they would no longer be able to supply the market with goods. Many stores simply closed their doors by week's end, unable to stock shelves with items ranging from toothpaste to milk The government says manufacturers are storing away goods to pressure it into increasing import subsidies, which have been curtailed. `` In <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, the scarcity is false and distorted,'' said President <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Lusinchi </PERSON> late Friday. He blamed manufacturers for hoarding and smugglers for taking goods out of the country, especially to neighboring <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. Venezuelan products often fetch higher prices there. The homemakers said they were fed up with both the government and manufacturers. They announced they would protest this week in front of the government's Superintendency for Consumer Protection to highlight the scarcity. `` The government says there's no problems because they assigned the dollars -LRB- for import subsidies -RRB-. The industrialists say they have n't gotten them. The truth is consumers have lost faith in both the government and the industrialists,'' said <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Vegas </PERSON>, head of a neighborhood group. Advertisements placed in local newspapers by a soap maker and a paper manufacturer blamed the government for cutting back on the subsidies granted to Venezuelan companies to import goods. President-elect <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> has warned the program must be eliminated in an effort to bolster <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar reserves, which are used in the program. A slump in prices for oil, a major national export, has contributed to the reserve crisis. Manufacturers and the business community generally welcome the reform in the long run. However, they blame the <PERSON> Lusinchi </PERSON> administration for the shortfall in reserves that led to the cutback in dollars for imports. `` There's one reason for the scarcity. The government has no money to assign us,'' said <PERSON> Habib </PERSON> <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>, a diaper manufacturer. He said his company, <ORGANIZATION> Panales </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mammi </ORGANIZATION>, has cut production in half and denied it was hoarding.

<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 In an uncertain world, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> stood for certainty. He was unwavering, absolute in his convictions _ especially when changing. Consistency was not a hobgoblin of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House. That style not only worked, it triumphed. The 40th president left office on Friday with the highest public approval ratings since the pollsters started keeping score. A <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll conducted Jan. 12 to 15 showed that 68 percent approval of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s job performance. That's 9 points higher than the farewell approval rating of <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>. And <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made those numbers count politically. He was the first president in 60 years to leave office at the inauguration of an elected successor of his own party. For <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the genius was not in the details but, more often, in avoiding them. He made U turns without a signal, and usually without a problem. He campaigned against deficits and tripled them. He won the biggest tax cut in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history and later quietly signed the biggest increase. He denounced <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s `` evil empire,'' then fashioned a `` new closeness'' with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under new leadership. A prime exhibit: the swollen federal budget deficit. `` Time and again I have proposed measures to help curb federal domestic program spending,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in the budget he bequeathed to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Time and again these proposals have been rejected by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' He said the deficit problem began with the recession that hit early in his first term, and worsened because he could n't get half the spending curbs he sought. By <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s reckoning, he had n't changed, conditions had So he kept making the deficit speech while the deficit soared on his watch. But in six of the eight <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budget years, the budget passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> actually was lower than that proposed by the administration. Supplemental appropriations, approved after the budget resolution was adopted, pushed actual spending higher than the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budget in all but two of those years. Those additions were the handiwork of both <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> campaigned in 1980 with a promise to balance the budget within a four-year term. The federal debt has nearly tripled, to $ 2.6 trillion, during his two terms. The average deficit was $ 180 billion. With deficits worsening, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> insisted that a balanced budget had not been a campaign commitment _ `` I've never said anything but that it was a goal.'' He promised a military buildup and he delivered, a $ 2.4 trillion expansion during his eight years. That fed the deficit and the struggle over priorities that raged through both his terms. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> political challenges stayed the hands of two presidents, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, in arms control dealings with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> dropped the word `` detente'' from his vocabulary while fending off <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1976. Compared with the Reagan-era thaw, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s detente was a chill <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s farewell address described `` a satisfying new closeness with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' He and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed the treaty to scrap intermediate range nuclear missiles, met at the summit five times in three years and fashioned a dramatically different relationship between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that was possible because `` this time, so far, it's different,'' the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has changed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> changed, too, but he was n't given to mentioning it. When the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms sales of 1985 and 1986 were disclosed, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> insisted he had not tried to trade arms for hostages. The record showed otherwise. When his own investigating commission said so, the president acknowledged that what he called an attempted opening to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had deteriorated into arms for hostages. Even then, he said `` my heart and my best intentions still tell me'' it was n't a trade despite `` the facts and the evidence.'' Soon afterward he reverted to the no-trade position and stuck with it to the end of his term. For all that, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s years were years of evolution. `` They call it the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Revolution and I'll accept that,'' he said, `` but for me it always seemed more like the great rediscovery: a rediscovery of our values and our common sense.'' Rediscovery or revolution, it rewrote the agenda, ending an era in which government programs multiplied to address each emerging problem. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> always said that government was the problem, not the solution. He argued that the government should n't have more revenue because it would only spend the money. His parting budget advice was to curb deficits `` by continuing to limit the appetite of government.'' A troubling legacy to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the deficits <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> rued may yet serve the purposes of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> revolution. Limits on government are more easily enforced when borrowing is the only way to pay the bills.

 `` You're going to see a lousy dancer trying to dance the first dance with the first lady,'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the crowd Friday night as he took his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>'s hand and moved about the platform to the tune of `` I Could Have Danced All Night.'' The dance was brief, but the appearance by the president and first lady was enough for the 5,000 that jammed the newly-restored train station's Main Hall. They cheered as the first couple walked the deck atop the center kiosk and waved. Above them, red, white and blue bursts of sparkles, gold bunting and light blue streamers were hanging from every corner. Outside, guests purchased T-shirts, sweatshirts and other souvenirs at a stand equipped with a credit card machine.

<HEAD>At the Kennedy Center: No Room Even to Faint</HEAD>

 Several people fainted during the sardine-can simulation at the Kennedy Center, where 5,000 people in a place that maybe could accommodate 1,500. The crowd was so dense that one woman who fainted was kept from falling to the floor: no floor space was available. One woman complained that she had spent `` all this money'' on her new ball gown and the only place it could be seen was the ladies room. No one could move from shortly after the party began at 8 p.m. in the Grand Foyer that parallels the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and connects the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s three auditoriums, until after <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s five-minute visit at 11:25 p.m. During the three-hour wait for the Bushes' visit, the shoulder-to-bosom audience whiled away the time by talking to their neighbors. The resulting din was such that: Even conversation was difficult and the most effective communications award should go to the two women sign-language users who had been stationed on either side of the make-shift stage so they could translate <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comments to the hard-of-hearing. During the long-wait for the presidential party, the two signers chatted back and forth across the 50-foot stage.

 Several thousand young Republicans danced shoulder to shoulder to the throbbing beat of rock bands and music videos and roared their approval for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` To be included in this is incredible,'' said <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Trost </PERSON>, 16, of <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, who got her $ 30 ticket from a friend.

<HEAD>At Armory, Young Americans Toast A ``Get-Down President''</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Dress and decorum were relaxed at the Young Americans Ball for the under-30 crowd at the D.C. Armory, where ballroom dancing was replaced with hard rock, wall-sized video screens and even a bunny-hop line or two. Organizers had tried to soften the cavernous setting with red, white and blue drapes, fringed metallic streamers and flowers, but it still had a look akin to a high school gymnasium dressed up for the prom. Long gowns mixed with short skirts; tuxedos alternated with suits. Before the fete had ended, the floor was littered with stadium-size Budweiser cups, beer cans and empty champagne bottles. Young women _ and occassionally their dates _ were seen slipping off their too-tight shoes. Between the appearances of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the latter of whom looked like he would have fit right in, the biggest hit of the night was actor <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>. A bevy of squealing girls and clicking cameras tracked him around the room.

 Some waited more than five hours for their chance to applaud the new president at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hilton </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arrived after his appearances at the other 10 official ball sites. `` When's he getting here?'' `` Are we really last?'' `` What time did you hear he was coming?'' The main ballroom was so jammed that for more than an hour the local fire marshals, aided at first by Boy Scouts and later by police, barred the doors. `` You should have heard them. They were banging on the doors. They were shouting. They paid all that money for tickets and they wanted in,'' said a fire inspector.

<HEAD>Bush: No Concessions, But `Won't Forget' Any Help For Hostages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said on his first day in the Oval Office Saturday he is prepared to respond in kind to any acts of good will by those holding Americans hostage, but will make no concessions `` to free those precious lives.'' `` People in the past facilitated the release of our citizens, and I'd love to see that happen again, and I wo n't _ and I wo n't forget it,'' if it does, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared. In a freewheeling exchange with reporters, the new president also said he intends to meet with congressional leaders Tuesday to discuss the government's spending deficit, and has asked to address a joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Feb. 9. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hinted that would be a more specific call to action than what he termed a `` thematic'' inaugural address on Friday. `` Stay tuned. Feb. 9th, we'll have something a little different, if that's the date that's settled on,'' he said. After a night of celebration at 11 inaugural balls, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> were up early to open the doors of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to 4,500 ordinary Americans, many of whom had stood in line for hours in bitter cold for a special tour and a chance to stroll the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawn </LOCATION>. It was the first `` open house'' at the executive mansion since <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> held a public reception 80 years ago. But it was hardly reminiscent of the most famous such occurrence, when thousands of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> frontiersmen in muddy boots followed <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> through the doors in 1829 and virtually trashed the place. After personally escorting 15 tourists, picked at random, through his new home, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took his place at the Oval Office desk occupied by <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for the last eight years. There, he found a personal note left behind by his mentor, inscribed on joke-shop stationery which bore the printed heading: `` Do n't Let the Turkeys Get You Down.'' Beneath it was <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s handwriting: `` Dear George. You'll have moments when you want to use this particular stationery. Well, go to it. <PERSON> George </PERSON>, I treasure the memories we share and wish you all the very best. You'll be in my prayers. God Bless you and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>. I'll miss our Thursday lunches <PERSON> Ron </PERSON>.'' Showing the note to reporters, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said none of those assembled should take the `` turkey'' reference personally. `` It is a broad, ecumenical statement,'' he grinned. With his aging mother, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, seated at his side, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took his first presidential news conference question: Q: How does it feel to be president? A: It feels just fine. It's setting in now after the glamour and excitement of the inauguration. It's a great joy to have my mother here, the leader of our family. Later, he declared `` It's the most exciting day of my life so far. It just is wonderful. Everything's been perfect. Everything's so beautiful. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, too, he would soon respond to a `` generous letter'' from Soviet Leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. In the letter, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> he hoped his term would bring `` stable and diverse development of relations between our countries,'' and that they could work together `` to eliminate the threat of war.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s schedule included an intelligence briefing from <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adviser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scowcroft </ORGANIZATION> and Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, an appearance at a luncheon for the financial organizers of his $ 25 million inaugural, and a second night of formal revelry, including a `` Black Tie' n' Boots'' ball for his fellow Texans. His official inaugural calendar ends Sunday with a national prayer service at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Cathedral. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> acknowledged he could n't find his way around the White House his first night, after he and the first lady returned from the long round of balls. `` I got lost trying to find a couple of kids' rooms, yeah,'' he chuckled. Along with his mother, five of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s children, their spouses and 10 grandchildren shared the first night in the mansion. After a luncheon for the entire <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> clan in town _ 240 relatives in all _ the kin scattered. `` It's a great joy to have our kids over there -LRB- in the living quarters -RRB- last night,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` One got sick, so I had the duty at about 6 o'clock this morning _ <PERSON> Ellie </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBlond </PERSON>. I pumped half a Tylenol into her and she's looking good. Ate two pancakes. What you'd call a rapid recovery.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expressed special feeling, too, for the thousands who stood outside the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, in subfreezing temperatures, for a chance to tour it at the new president's invitation. The White House is routinely opened for limited tours by the public, but this was different. `` I must say that was kind of interesting,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I was saying to myself, ` Now what does it take for somebody to stay awake all night to come into the White House? What kind of people are they? Well, they were all different kinds of people. A lot of kids. A lot of young people. Some older. `` The common thread was that they felt they were lucky to be there, which amazed me in a sense because I thought we were so lucky to have people that would care that much.'' On the hostage issue, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked if his inaugural address reflected any movement or change of policy regarding the imprisonment of <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> Correspondent <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and eight other Americans believed held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by Shiite Moslems. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had said in the speech that `` assistance can be shown here, and will be long remembered. Good will begets good will.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters `` I do n't think it's a change of policy. But I wanted to be sure I mentioned in that speech my absolute determination not to forget either ... the POW-MIAs or these hostages. And I wanted that right in there. It was one the few specific points in an otherwise thematic speech. And in terms of your question, I hope it was heard around the world. `` You know,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added, `` we keep hearing rumors that countries want to have improved relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. I wanted to make clear to them that good will begets good will. I also know enough about the situation to think, in fairness, that because of the nature of the hostage-holders you can ca n't finger any one country for holding Americans hostage against their will. `` But people have in the past facilitated the release of our citizens, and I'd love to see that happen again, and I wo n't _ and I wo n't forget it. `` But having said that,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> concluded, `` we're not going to escalate the currency of holding Americans hostage. We're not going to have people feel that we are going to make concessions in order to free those precious lives.''

 `` You're going to see a lousy dancer trying to dance the first dance with the first lady,'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the crowd Friday night as he took his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>'s hand and moved about the platform to the tune of `` I Could Have Danced All Night.'' The dance was brief, but the appearance by the president and first lady was enough for the 5,000 that jammed the newly-restored train station's Main Hall. They cheered as the first couple walked the deck atop the center kiosk and waved. Above them, red, white and blue bursts of sparkles, gold bunting and light blue streamers were hanging from every corner. Outside, guests purchased T-shirts, sweatshirts and other souvenirs at a stand equipped with a credit card machine.

<HEAD>At the Kennedy Center: No Room Even to Faint</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Several people fainted during the sardine-can simulation at the Kennedy Center, where 5,000 people in a place that maybe could accommodate 1,500. The crowd was so dense that one woman who fainted was kept from falling to the floor: no floor space was available. One woman complained that she had spent `` all this money'' on her new ball gown and the only place it could be seen was the ladies room. No one could move from shortly after the party began at 8 p.m. in the Grand Foyer that parallels the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and connects the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s three auditoriums, until after <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s five-minute visit at 11:25 p.m. During the three-hour wait for the Bushes' visit, the shoulder-to-bosom audience whiled away the time by talking to their neighbors. The resulting din was such that: Even conversation was difficult and the most effective communications award should go to the two women sign-language users who had been stationed on either side of the make-shift stage so they could translate <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comments to the hard-of-hearing. During the long-wait for the presidential party, the two signers chatted back and forth across the 50-foot stage.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Congressional leaders on Saturday praised the tone of conciliation sounded by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in his inaugural address but said the nation should expect some discord as the new administration pursues an agenda. `` There's a good spirit now and I think that's useful,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader `` There will be some difficulties and disagreements obviously but it's a good mood in which to start any administration.'' `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has done everything during the transition that he could to offer an olive branch to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., the House Minority Whip `` The reaction yesterday on both sides of the aisle was very positive to the president's speech,'' he said. But he cautioned: `` I think people should n't mistake this for meaning there wo n't be disagreements. There will be. ... That's as it should be.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> appeared on <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Newsmaker Saturday'' program. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in his inaugural address on Friday asked for a new cooperative spirit between the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the Democratic <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. While he offered little detail of what specific proposals he'll ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to approve, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech was greeted warmly by the opposition. On Saturday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he has suggested to congressional leaders that he address a joint session of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 9 to lay out his plans. `` It was a beautiful and warm speech, less ideological -LRB- than former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB- and I feel much better,'' Rep. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Beilenson </PERSON>, D-Calif., said of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inaugural address But <PERSON> Beilenson </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> still was not dealing realistically with the deficit and the need for raising taxes. `` We've got to all stop this pretense with there not being any additional revenues. You ca n't do that. The realities are somewhat different,'' he said. Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> have insisted that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign pledge not to raise taxes is unrealistic, and that new revenues will be needed to meet deficit reduction targets But they are equally insistent that they will not propose new taxes on their own _ that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will eventually admit the need for new federal revenue. Some of the first difficult disagreements of his presidency will ensue next month when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to send <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> his detailed proposals for revising the fiscal 1990 budget that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> submitted on Jan. 9. But even when conflict comes, Democrats predicted it would be less acrimonious than the often sharp battles with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` I think <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> understands the Congress and the need for working with cooperation,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, former majority leader and the new chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> `` We've had too much confrontation. The people will be better served,'' he said. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s reputation for `` straightforwardness and openness'' will serve him well on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, co-chairman of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s transition team, said on the <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> program that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has the advantage, when compared to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, of his long year in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> including two terms in the House. `` You have relationships of respect and trust on both sides that have been built up over the years,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> based his appeal for bipartisanship largely on foreign policy, the area of his greatest expertise. In his inaugural speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seemed to hint that there would be no new money for some of the social, educational and environmental programs he has championed. Instead, where money is needed, it will be shifted from other spending categories or sought from non-governmental sources, he indicated. `` Our funds are low,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` We have a deficit to bring down. We have more will than wallet. But will is what we need,'' he said. Rep. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he saw `` hard times coming. `` He pointed to the private sector, and to sacrifice'' as ways to achieve some of the goals, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> said. `` You're going to have a confrontation of numbers, and of policies.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said he doubted a full-scale `` budget summit'' such as the one with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> following the 1987 stock market crisis will soon occur, although congressional leaders have already been invited to the White House for a meeting on the deficit next week.

 Voters in three Indian states cast ballots Saturday in elections testing the popularity of Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, and reports said at least 19 people were injured in election-related violence. A success in the state polling could allow <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> to call early national Parliamentary elections. Voting was suspended at five centers in the state of <LOCATION> Nagaland </LOCATION> after clashes between rival groups left three people injured, election officials said. At least 16 supporters of <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> were injured in the key state of <LOCATION> Tamil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nadu </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. The news agency also said two bombs exploded there, but there were no reports of casualties. Despite the violence, election officials reported heavy turnouts in polling for assemblies in three states, where voting will restore local rule. The government in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> imposed federal rule in the states last year after political crises there. In <LOCATION> Tamil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nadu </LOCATION>, a southern state, an estimated 65 percent of 36 million eligible voters went to the polls, election officials said. An estimated 75 percent of 600,000 eligible voters in the state of <LOCATION> Nagaland </LOCATION> and about 97 percent of 300,000 eligible voters in <LOCATION> Mizoram </LOCATION> cast ballots. Results are expected Sunday. Saturday's elections are important for <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and his party because they faced popular regional parties in all three states. But the crucial test is <LOCATION> Tamil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nadu </LOCATION>, where more than 2,000 candidates vied for 234 seats in the state assembly. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> must call national elections by December, but a <LOCATION> Tamil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nadu </LOCATION> victory could allow him to move sooner. A loss there could give more time to organize to the newly formed <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which is trying to unite behind <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s chief rival, V.P. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>. Pre-election polls showed <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> trailing the front-runner, <PERSON> Muthuvel </PERSON> <PERSON> Karunanidhi </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Dravida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Munnetra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kazhagam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. That party was expected to win about 120 of the 234 seats. <PERSON> Karunanidhi </PERSON> is backed by <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Karunanidhi </PERSON> served as <LOCATION> Tamil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nadu </LOCATION> chief minister from 1967 to 1976, when he lost to M.G. <PERSON> Ramachandran </PERSON>, a popular actor who turned to politics at the peak of his career. <PERSON> Ramachandran </PERSON> led <LOCATION> Tamil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nadu </LOCATION> for 10 years until he died December 1987. His death split the huge <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dravida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Munnetra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kazhagam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> into two factions. One is now led by his 64-year-old widow, <PERSON> Janaki </PERSON>. The other is led his leading lady on screen who says she secretly married him off screen, <PERSON> Jayalalitha </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayaram </PERSON>. The leader of the winning party will become chief minister. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s party has not said who it would pick if it won in <LOCATION> Tamil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nadu </LOCATION>. Sixty seats are at stake in <LOCATION> Nagaland </LOCATION>, a remote hilly state bordering <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Forty seats are being contested in <LOCATION> Mizoram </LOCATION>, which borders <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>. Both states have a history of insurgency and ethnic unrest.

<TEXT>
 On a day when much of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was discussing what <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will or should do, a group of scholars and scarred political veterans gathered to talk about what he ca n't do. `` Fragmentation,'' `` micromanagement,'' `` constraints,'' `` stymied,'' `` encroachment'' were the terms of art at a seminar on `` The Fettered Presidency'' staged on the last full day of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidency by the conservative <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. It drew participation from old Reaganite figures such as <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Perle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jeane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>. Their theme, summed up by <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Crovitz </PERSON>, a Wall Street Journal editorialist: `` Instead of an imperial presidency, we have an imperial <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, aided by an activist court.'' The same thought popped into the head of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during an impromptu news conference Saturday on his first day in the White House. `` I'm concerned, as a lot of congressmen are, as a lot of senators are, about the erosion of presidential power,'' he said. He said he wanted to talked `` with reasonable members in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the House'' about how `` to reestablish in the presidency the firm hand that I think the Constitution gave the president.'' The discussion at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> Thursday celebrated the publication of a book, its cover picturing a White House encircled by a chain, which made the same case: <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has managed to erode the power of the presidency and of the executive branch and presidents from here on out should fight to regain the power they once exercised. A chart showed that one legislative restriction on the president's ability to conduct foreign affairs was enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> between 1789 and 1900 and 37 were adopted between 1950 and 1960, but 191 passed during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s eight-year watch. `` He leaves the office of the presidency weaker than he found it in 1981,'' lamented <PERSON> Crovitz </PERSON>, saying <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had been a strong president but an unsuccessful one `` as the keeper of the institution of the presidency.'' The problem of congressional usurpation of power cripples all chief executives, he said; it would have been just as severe `` for a President <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s rejected nominee to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, wrote to complain of an `` intrusive and debilitating congressional oversight of intelligence activities'' and of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' `` vacillating incursions into foreign policy'' such as the Boland amendments restricting the use of money to help the Contras. He deplored, particularly, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s 8-1 `` unsurprising but disappointing decision'' upholding the law under which independent counsels are named to investigate the ethics of the executive branch. <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> said presidents must fight congressional encroachments, `` perhaps by refusing to accept some restrictions even at the risk of political damage.'' `` It would be a prolonged and bloody fight,'' he said, `` but our national well-being requires that it be made.'' <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s former <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, complained that a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that wants a hand in running foreign policy can not keep secrets and she said secrecy is vital to diplomacy. She deplored `` the ethic of reveal-all.'' <PERSON> Perle </PERSON>, former assistant secretary of defense, complained that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' `` micromanagement'' of the defense budget invited wastefulness. Once, he said, former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> wanted to chop $ 600 million worth of unneeded jets from the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget, but swallowed hard and accepted them when told the planes were built in the home district of a vital congressional chairman. And <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, who is moving into the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s counsel, wrote that the problem is exacerbated by a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, where most seats are safe, that has become `` vulnerable to the paralyzing effect of special interests.'' `` Democrats and incumbents,'' he wrote, `` generally have controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for so long that most members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have figured out how to achieve the rough equivalence of life tenure.''

<HEAD>Syrian Defense Minister Says U.S. Trooper Carried Bomb</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s defense minister alleged that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> duped an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldier into carrying the bomb that blew up a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jet over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> last month. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> called the charge `` ridiculous.'' `` An agent of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> intelligence, <ORGANIZATION> Mossad </ORGANIZATION>, handed him the bomb-laden bag to carry in return for $ 300,000, claiming it was diamonds worth $ 500,000 needed to be smuggled into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Tlass </PERSON> said in an interview published Saturday in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s daily Al-Qabas. Reached in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tlass </PERSON> confirmed the newspaper reported his statements correctly, but he refused to give additional information. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Alon </PERSON> <PERSON> Leil </PERSON> said, `` It is ridiculous and malicious. This story shows how the Syrian leaders are not serious toward <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and peace in the region.'' <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s most vehement enemy in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has accused Palestinian terrorists of placing the bomb and has dismissed claims of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> involvement as ludicrous. The Syrian minister did not say where he got his information, but he said it was known to Western investigators. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, in an unattributed report Jan. 15, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government investigators are looking into the theory the bomb went aboard the plane with a soldier involved in a diamond smuggling ring. All 259 people on board <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 were killed and 11 people on the ground in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, died when the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 fell from the sky Dec. 21. The flight originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and stopped in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> en route to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tlass </PERSON> said `` the one who carried the explosives aboard the plane in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> was one of the American soldiers serving at a base in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and he did it unknowingly.'' He did not name the soldier. British investigators determined the plane was destroyed by a bomb placed in the luggage hold, but they have not said who was responsible. Representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> have talked of a Mossad connection, suggesting <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> planned the attack to throw blame on the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and undermine a new dialogue between the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Suspicions also have turned on several Syrian-backed Palestinian factions which might be trying to derail peace overtures of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. In addition, a caller claiming to represent an Iranian group called the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution made two calls to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> saying that group planted the bomb.

<HEAD>Doctors Say Dali is Near Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FIGUERAS, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Doctors treating <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> for a heart ailment and other problems said Saturday the famed surrealist artist appeared to be close to death. Dr. <PERSON> Carles </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponsati </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>'s chief physician, said the 84-year-old painter has `` a great will to live ... and this is what is keeping him alive.'' He said <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> was not responding to treatment for heart trouble, which has been aggravated by pneumonia, and that he needs an oxygen mask to breathe. <PERSON> Ponsati </PERSON> also heads <ORGANIZATION> Figueras </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> returned Wednesday after his condition deteriorated. Dr. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON>, who treated <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> during two previous hospital stays since November, told the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> EFE </ORGANIZATION> the painter had only `` a one-in-a-thousand chance'' of surviving his present crisis. `` Even if he does, he would suffer the same again in a short time,'' he said. <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> has suffered chronic heart ailments and has been in a wheelchair since August 1984, when he suffered severe burns in a fire in his former home in nearby <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pera </LOCATION>. Afterward, he moved to quarters next to the Dali Theater-Museum in Figueras, near the French border. He has since lived there in seclusion, fed through a tube and watched round the clock by a team of nurses. In 1986, he underwent surgery to receive a heart pacemaker. A founding member of the surrealist art movement, <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> is the last of an outstanding generation of <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> painters that included <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Miro </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> is best known for his eerie, dreamlike landscapes. Figueras Mayor <PERSON> Mariano </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorca </PERSON>, a friend of <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone the painter had requested he make arrangements for <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>'s burial in the inner court of the museum in <LOCATION> Figueras </LOCATION>. The museum, a converted municipal theater, is filled with <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>'s works and crowned by giant golden eggs and a glass dome <PERSON> Lorca </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> also requested his body lie in state at his Galatea Tower residence next to the museum and that a funeral service be held in <PERSON> Figueras </PERSON>' San Pere Roman Catholic parish church, where <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> was baptized. <PERSON> Lorca </PERSON> said parish priest <PERSON> Narcis </PERSON> <PERSON> Costabella </PERSON> visited <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> in the hospital Friday and <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> asked him to return.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Celebrated ballerina <PERSON> Natalia </PERSON> <PERSON> Makarova </PERSON> said Saturday that Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has fostered an artistic renaissance in her homeland, which she soon will visit for the first time since defecting in 1970. The dancer, speaking in an interview in her <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> apartment, said she is pleased with changes in Soviet society under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` I think he is a very courageous man. It gives a new spring for any form of art. I think artistic life will flourish if this progress continues. `` It is quite difficult for <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> people to take this freedom because years without freedom left its imprint. But they will get used to it, and I think it will be really great for artists to express whatever they want to say.'' During the interview, the day before she left on the two-week visit, the 47-year-old ballerina wore a long, pale green scarf as a headband, a black and white knitted top, and black pants. She smoked a cigarette in a black holder. Ms. <PERSON> Makarova </PERSON> has been invited to <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> by her old company, the <LOCATION> Kirov </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION>. She trained and advanced to principal dancer with the company before breaking away while on tour in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in September 1970. `` I wanted greater artistic freedom and opportunity,'' she said. Granted asylum to start a new career, she became an international star. She made her home in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, married <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Karker </PERSON> and raised their son, <PERSON> Andrusha </PERSON>. He remains at home to go to school, but <PERSON> Karker </PERSON> will accompany his wife to <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Makarova </PERSON> will make two stage appearances during her visit. She also has been invited by the <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> film festival to show her series of four one-hour programs titled `` Ballerina,'' made in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to describe a ballerina's life and recently shown in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. She said she believes she is the first Soviet artist defector to be invited back since the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. `` <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> went back to perform, but he was never a defector,'' she said. Pianist <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> emigrated from his homeland in 1925 and became a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen. He returned in 1986 on a visit and performed there. Asked what she had missed most in her native land, Ms. <PERSON> Makarova </PERSON> said in heavily accented English: `` Not to be able to dance in the Kirov, the nature of the Russian people, the Russian countryside, not to be able to communicate. `` Most of all, I missed my family and friends, and it's very important for me to see them after almost 19 years,'' she said. The dancer decided to stay in the West nine years after <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Nureyev </PERSON> quit the Kirov to defect while on tour. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> followed suit four years after Ms. <PERSON> Makarova </PERSON> left.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday released a report urging <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s government to investigate `` the widespread killing of community leaders.'' The report came a month after the death of environmental activist <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Chico </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON>, whose murder drew international attention. `` <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> fears that when public interest in the murder of <PERSON> Chico </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON> abates, his case will follow the pattern of cases now numbering many hundreds which remain pending because of inconclusive or obstructed investigations,'' the report said. Brazilian authorities have said that <PERSON> Darcy </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, the 21-year-old son of a rancher, has confessed to the killing. <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON>, 42, was an internationally acclaimed ecologist who said he received death threats from cattler ranchers for organizing demonstrations against deforestation of the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> rain forest. He was under local police protection when he was shot. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said authorities did not investigate six previous attempts to murder <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON>. It said he was one of five rural trade union presidents killed in 1988. `` These cases are among hundreds which show the result of governmental failure to take effective action against political killings in rural areas,'' said the organization, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977. `` A new wave of death threats and killings began after the municipal elections of November 1988,'' <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said. `` More than 1,000 killings have occurred since 1980 in the context of land disputes. `` Amnesty International's information indicates that less than 1 percent of these killings have resulted in convictions of gunmen or of people who hired them to kill.''

 Jurors who begin deliberating alleged child killer <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s fate Monday could send him to prison for most of his remaining life even if they believe his version of what happened to his `` adopted'' daughter. Even if the jurors accept <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s claim that he returned home to find 6-year-old <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> comatose, it is undisputed that he virtually ignored her while she lay unconscious on the cold tiles of their bathroom floor for several hours. Instead, he lay in bed with <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, his battered live-in companion, getting high on cocaine and its derivative, crack. Before the jurors get the case, state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> will tell them the defendant had a parental duty to see to the health and safety of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, the girl he got illegally at birth from an unwed teen-ager and raised as his own. The judge will tell them that if they find <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> showed `` depraved indifference'' to the first-grader's life, they may convict him of second-degree murder, even if he never hit the child. He could face up to 25 years to life. The jury can also consider first-degree manslaughter, punishable by up to 25 years, second-degree manslaughter, a maximum of 15 years, and criminally negligent homicide, up to four years. `` Anything less than a verdict of second-degree murder is a victory for the defense,'' said <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> lawyer <LOCATION> Ira </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and co-counsel <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> DiLuzio </PERSON> say <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> was attacked in a jealous rage by Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, who saw the child as a rival for the affection of the man she considered a god. <PERSON> DiLuzio </PERSON> says <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, 47, left <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> `` alive and well'' with Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, whom the lawyer called `` a poor excuse for a woman and a mother,'' when he went to dinner with a friend the evening of Nov. 1, 1987. <PERSON> DiLuzio </PERSON> says <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> returned about three hours later and found <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> unconscious, and even now does not know what really happened. The next morning, emergency medical service workers took <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> from <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> apartment to a hospital. She died three days later. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolaro </PERSON> says it was <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, drugged with cocaine and vexed and frustrated by the child's rebelliousness, who struck <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> `` He's a huge guy and she's a little girl and she gets knocked out,'' <PERSON> Casolaro </PERSON> said in his summation Friday. `` And then he leaves the apartment and goes to get dinner,'' he continued, `` and he comes back and does some more drugs, and he does n't do a thing for the next 12 hours until six in the morning when she finally stops breathing.'' `` These are acts of omission that put her in grave risk of death,'' <PERSON> Casolaro </PERSON> said. `` This is n't just depraved indifference to human life; this is monumental indifference to human life.'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s lawyers claimed several times during the trial that he did not perceive the danger that <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> was in and that he thought she was asleep. And in their double-barreled summation _ part of it by <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and part by <PERSON> DiLuzio </PERSON> _ the defense lawyers asserted that even if <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> had called for medical help sooner it would not have done <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> any good. This, <PERSON> Casolaro </PERSON> said, is unknowable. He said the point in any case is that <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> ignored his duty to summon help for his clearly distressed child. The prosecutor conceded that <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> did n't intend to kill the child. But, he added, `` He's an adult. He knows what smashing a 6-year-old girl in the head would do. ... You have to ask, ` Is n't this the equivalent of taking a gun and shooting her in the head?''

 Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> will travel to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> on Sunday in an effort to halt fighting between rival Shiite Moslem factions in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>'s visit was expected by leaders of the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> group who are optimistic about its outcome, said the agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. On Friday, top <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON> called for an end to bitter fighting between <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and the Syrian-backed Amal militia in which 168 people have died and 318 been wounded since Dec. 31. Over the last two days the fighting has stopped, but each side has been fortifying its positions in the southern suburbs of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-proclaimed security zone. The fragile truce is believed to have been arranged by Syrian troops in charge of security in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Moslem sectors, a Lebanese police spokesman said. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, has more than 40,000 troops there, including a 7,500-strong force in Moslem-controlled west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and another 4,500 soldiers in the south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> slums where the clashes erupted Dec. 31. Within a day they spread to south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Amal and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> have been locked in a struggle for control of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 1 million Shiites, the country's largest single sect, since last April. More than 500 people have been killed and 1,500 wounded since then. The mainstream Amal, which is Arabic for `` hope,'' wants to prevent <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, from setting up an Iranian-style Islamic state in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The fighting also has strained <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s alliance with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON>'s plea followed appeals to the warring militias from Iranian President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> as well as mediation by Syrian officials. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>'s trip to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> is the third this month by an Iranian foreign ministry official.

<HEAD>Falling Space Debris Lights Up The Sky Across U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 A spectacular light show that some mistook for a crashing airplane or a comet when it lit up the night sky over several states was just the body of a derelict Soviet rocket burning up in the atmosphere, officials said Saturday. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and military bureaus and bases across the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> were swamped with calls about Friday night's display, officials said. Sightings of the object around 9:10 p.m. EST were reported from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, officials said. `` It was definitely a Soviet rocket body that was re-entering the Earth's atmosphere,'' said Maj. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, Colo. He said the rocket body that fell out of orbit was either `` destroyed in re-entry, or fragments of it have fallen to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and are some place, but who knows where.'' Most such objects burn up before hitting the ground. The re-entry was unusual only because it happened over land and was visible in the night sky, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> England </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said the object `` just appeared all of a sudden out of the south and fell straight due north and it left a line just as straight as could be.'' Some callers thought that was a sign of trouble. `` They thought a plane blew up in the sky,'' said <PERSON> Patsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Halfacre </PERSON>, dispatcher for the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, sheriff's department. `` It was the most horrible thing I ever saw and it scared the heck out of me.

 Blacks gathered on Saturday to bury one of the two men killed in a police shooting that sparked race riots, and police said many of those arrested in the uprising would be kept behind bars until after the Super Bowl. Elsewhere, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> erupted in parties and hoopla for Sunday's football extravaganza in stark contrast to the tension and violence of last week, and police arranged for tight security at <LOCATION> Joe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Robbie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION>, 15 miles north of the city About 150 people entered the <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> for the funeral of <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, a passenger on a motorcycle whose unarmed driver was gunned down Monday in the <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> neighborhood by a Hispanic police officer. Police were chasing the motorcycle for a traffic violation. <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, 24, died of injuries suffered when the motorcycle crashed. His family made televised appeals for calm in <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Driver <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, 23, who was killed by a shot to the head, will be buried Monday. Riots touched off by the shooting left one man dead, and 11 others were treated for gunshot wounds. Thirteen buildings were torched and others looted in the two black neighborhoods, and 372 people were arrested, authorities said. There were less serious disturbances in the black section of the Coconut Grove neighborhood. <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> was remembered as a youth who `` resented trouble and violence,'' and worked with both the elderly and schoolchildren in his native <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. After the service, <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>'s family and community leaders said they hoped the burial would also lay to rest the tension in the community. `` We would like to have peace and not have violence,'' brother <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said. `` The tension has somewhat dissipated. ... As of now things are under control,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, president of Operation PUSH in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` Forgiveness has already taken place. But we're not going to forget that there's a lot of things that need to be accomplished here in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> before we can eradicate this type of action.'' Another death was linked to the riots when a 66-year-old asthmatic was found dead Friday in his <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> apartment of a clogged bronchial tube. His family said he had tried unsuccessfully to stop the burning of a grocery store, and smoke and tear gas aggravated his condition. Police remained on 12-hour shifts, ready for any signs of a rekindling of the violence, spokesman <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bitsis </PERSON> said Saturday. Sgt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazur </PERSON> said authorities planned to keep about 150 rioters locked up until after the Super Bowl. They were unable to post $ 250 bail. <PERSON> Mazur </PERSON> said there will be arraignments Monday. If those arrested plead guilty, they will be released based on time served, he said. Police said only people with tickets for the game between the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> 49ers and <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bengals </ORGANIZATION> will be allowed past the parking gates at the stadium. If protesters obstruct the entrance, they will be moved out quickly, spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> said. Some 300 officers have been assigned to the stadium. On the edge of <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>, <PERSON> Liza </PERSON> <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> performed Friday night at the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arena </LOCATION> with a large police presence, but no trouble. A professional basketball game at the arena Tuesday night was canceled because of the unrest. Fireworks burst over <LOCATION> Biscayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> on Friday night as thousands of revelers listened to salsa and jazz bands at a shopping center and park less than a mile from where <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> was shot. In nearby <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, 3,000 people attended a bash held by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rozelle </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Stephen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Muss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Police blocked roads and stopped strangers on Saturday to prevent a vigil at the grave of a student who burned himself to death 20 years ago to protest the Soviet-led invasion. In the village of <LOCATION> Vsetaty </LOCATION>, 18 miles north of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, authorities checked the identifications of Western reporters and Czechoslovaks traveling on roads to the village. The village was the hometown of <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Palach </PERSON>, who burned himself to death in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s Wencenslas Square to protest the Soviet invasion that crushed the country's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> reforms of 1968. Czechoslovaks without Vsetaty residence permits or police permission to pass the roadblocks were told they could not go to the village, where the part of the cemetery where <PERSON> Palach </PERSON> is buried was closed for `` technical reasons,'' according to a sign outside. The Charter 77 human rights group called the vigil at <PERSON> Palach </PERSON>'s grave, but Western reporters at <LOCATION> Vsetaty </LOCATION> saw no sign of them in the village Activist <PERSON> Petr </PERSON> <PERSON> Uhl </PERSON> said on Friday that passenger trains traveling to Vsetaty would not stop there on Saturday. Uniformed police also patrolled Wenceslas Square late Saturday, but there were no crowds gathered as there had been the previous six evenings in the longest wave of unrest since the weeks after the 1968 invasion. An attempt to commemorate <PERSON> Palach </PERSON> on Jan. 15 was broken up by police, spawning a week of demonstrations in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. The youth daily <ORGANIZATION> Mlada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fronta </ORGANIZATION> reported that police arrested 280 people during a demonstration Thursday, when truncheon-swinging riot police charged a crowd of more than 2,000, beating several people. Fourteen people, including three policemen, sought medical aid after that demonstration, <PERSON> Mlada </PERSON> <PERSON> Fronta </PERSON> said. Nine people, including a 59-year-old man who suffered a fractured skull, were injured on Jan. 15, it said. Police threats of violence and a heavy presence of riot police dispersed a silent crowd that gathered in Wenceslas Square for a sixth day on Friday. <ORGANIZATION> Mlada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fronta </ORGANIZATION> also reported that anonymous bomb threats had been made in the past 11 days against two <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> schools, the city's <PERSON> Kotva </PERSON> department store, the main railway station and the National Theater The reports that violence had been threatened appeared to be part of the efforts of Communist authorities to discredit dissidents and demonstrators. <PERSON> Mlada </PERSON> <PERSON> Fronta </PERSON> said all the places where bombs reportedly were planted were searched and nothing was found. But <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Kotva </ORGANIZATION> department store, said he knew nothing about a reported bomb threat when asked about it by a Western reporter. Several calls were made to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Rude Pravo and to a <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> emergency number threatening violence against security forces, the party daily said. The anonymous callers `` announced that if the police wo n't leave alone the anti-state demonstration in <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> on Friday, firearms will be used,'' the daily said.

<HEAD>New Report Says Cycle of Native Despair Likely to Continue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A baby boom among <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s natives could herald an increase in the rate of suicides, violent deaths and other problems plaguing the villagers, a new report says. The report, released Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natives </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, concludes that without major steps taken by the government, problems in the villages will likely only get worse. Especially troubling, the report said, is a population surge in rural villages that will mean an increasing number of young villagers without jobs, dependent on government benefits and at high risk of alcoholism, suicide and violent death. `` During the next two decades young native adults, many of whom have been brutalized by alcohol abuse, despair, violence and deaths in their homes and villages, will be having their own children,'' the report said. `` Unless the cycle can be broken, the projected high birth rate for young native adults will create a new generation at risk, far more numerous than the current one.'' The native birth rate in 1980 was twice the national average and 50 percent higher than the rate for non-natives in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, the report said. At the current rate, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s native population of 75,000 is expected to double in 26 years. Alcoholism, accidental death and suicide are major concerns among native Alaskans. Alaskans drink the equal of 4 gallons of pure alcohol per person each year, compared with the national average of 2.88 gallons, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcoholism </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> has twice the national average of accidental deaths, and 70 percent are alcohol-related, according to a 1982 state report. Suicide rates in rural <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> quadrupled during the past decade and doubled in urban areas, according to the 1982 report. Officials believe 80 percent of the suicides were alcohol-related. Among the recent report's conclusions: _ A plague of alcoholism, violence and self-destruction afflicts natives throughout <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> _ Village economies, based largely on public assistance or government jobs, can not meet the needs of the growing native population _ Despite improvements in public health, native Alaskans remain more vulnerable to serious injury, infectious disease and violent death than non-natives The document was the first `` status report'' on <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> natives published in a decade, said <ORGANIZATION> AFN </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Janie </PERSON> <PERSON> Leask </PERSON>. The report does not offer specific solutions, although <PERSON> Leask </PERSON> said it has become obvious that many government programs intended to help <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> natives have failed.

 Israeli soldiers accidentally killed a Palestinian mayor's bodyguard Saturday as protesters threw stones at the mayor, accusing him of cooperating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters said. Also in the occupied territories, a teen-ager was killed and four Arabs wounded in confrontations with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops. The deaths raised to 367 the number of Palestinians killed during the 11-month-old uprising. Fifteen Israelis also have died. Arab reporters said troops shot <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Karaish </PERSON>, 28, a bodyguard for <PERSON> Ismaeel </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemeid </PERSON>, the Israeli-appointed mayor of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Yatta </LOCATION>, eight miles south of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The reporters said <PERSON> Karaish </PERSON> was armed and protecting the mayor from a crowd of young Palestinian nationalists throwing rocks at <LOCATION> Hemeid </LOCATION>'s home and accusing him of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Israeli troops arriving at the scene saw an armed Palestinian in front of Hemeid's home and opened fire, accidentally killing <PERSON> Karaish </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters said. It was not clear exactly what <PERSON> Karaish </PERSON> was doing at the time he was shot or whether he had fired his gun. A preliminary army investigation revealed <PERSON> Karaish </PERSON> was carrying an Uzi submachine gun, which he was licensed to carry. The army could not confirm whether <PERSON> Karaish </PERSON> worked as a bodyguard for Hemeid or whether he was at the stone-throwing incident, but the military routinely gives weapons to pro-Israeli Palestinian figures. A military official said <PERSON> Karaish </PERSON> saw <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops coming toward him and opened fire at the soldiers. `` He thought he was being attacked,'' a military official said. `` The soldiers reacted and returned fire.'' An army spokesman said the military has sealed off the village and is investigating. Arab reporters said their was no evidence <PERSON> Karaish </PERSON> opened fire first and said the troops may have thought <PERSON> Karaish </PERSON> was a member of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> strike force. Thursday, a group calling itself the `` Palestinian Popular Army'' issued a leaflet calling for attacks on soldiers and Jewish settlers. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> claims it is forming strike forces in villages and towns throughout the occupied territories under the command of Force-17, a unit of <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> wing of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. In the <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> refugee camp in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, a teen-ager was killed in a confrontation with Israeli troops. Arab reporters identified the dead boy as 14-year-old <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Shariefah </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenaan </PERSON>. The army confirmed the death. Four Palestinians were wounded Saturday in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 Middle East War. In <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION>, a 27-year-old Palestinian was shot in the chest with a plastic bullet and a 22-year-old <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> was shot in the abdomen. Both were in serious condition. In <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, a 14-year-old girl was shot in the left knee while in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, a 60-year-old man was wounded in the neck after troops opened fire with plastic bullets to disperse stone-throwing youth. The army confirmed that three Palestinians were wounded in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, and said it was investigating the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> incident. On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> liberalized the army's open-fire policies by giving officers and specially designated soldiers permission to fire plastic bullets at stone-throwers and Arabs setting up roadblocks Previously, only officers could fire plastic bullets in self-defense or to incapacitate leaders of violent protests. The army also made security sweeps in villages throughout the occupied territories Saturday, holding over a hundred residents for questioning, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported.

<HEAD>Gunman Who Killed Two Officers Acted ``Bizarrely'' Before Shootings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A man who wrestled away a policeman's gun and fatally shot two officers before he was gunned down had acted bizarrely hours earlier, police and friends said. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> mumbled to himself Friday, looked dazed and occasionally raised his arms in the air, said friends and street acquaintances. <PERSON> Connors </PERSON>, 35, had been arrested at least twice for willful obstruction of a thoroughfare after standing in the middle of the street and waving his arms. The usually affable, easy-going <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> became violent just before noon in the parking lot of a doughnut shop, and he later was overheard telling one officer he had shot, `` I got you now.'' `` Basically, he was a nice, quiet, even-tempered guy,'' said <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Flamingo </PERSON>, 44, a friend of <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> who witnessed the shootings. `` He was the kind of person who'd talk to you about God, but I never saw him like this before.'' <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> had his own apartment but was well known among the homeless in downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>. `` I saw him about 7:35 this morning and he kind of mumbled,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who said he has known <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> for six years. `` I was wondering why he did n't speak. He was n't like that. He was a good guy. He'd come around and have a little fun with us all the time.'' Officers wore black bands on their badges Saturday in memory of their slain comrades, the first to die in the line of duty since 1985. The Friday shootings, witnessed by about 30 people, were partly videotaped by <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students doing a documentary on the homeless. It began as a routine call of a disturbance outside <PERSON> Winchell </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Donut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a block from the college. <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> had been acting `` bizarrely,'' repeatedly challenging people to fight and may have been accosting them for money, said Police Chief <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>. Officer <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, 45, a 19-year veteran working an overtime shift, approached <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> outside <PERSON> Winchell </PERSON>'s, which had evicted <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> three times, and attempted to calm him down. Almost immediately, <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> attacked the officer. Witnesses said the two men wrestled to the ground. But <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> managed to pull <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>'s .357 - caliber Magnum from his <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> ran off and called for help on his portable radio, police said. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> ducked around cars in the parking lot in an attempt to escape <PERSON> Connors </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> followed, shooting. Police said <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> fell to the ground, either from a gunshot or after losing his footing. Witness <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobias </PERSON> said that after the third shot, he heard <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> tell the officer, `` I got you now.'' As <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> lay on the cement, <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> walked up and shot him in the head, police said. Officer <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, 39, was flagged down by a bystander and came to <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>'s aid. However, as he climbed out of his car, <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> ran into the street and shot him once in the stomach and twice in the leg. Other officers arrived and fired at <ORGANIZATION> Connors </ORGANIZATION>, hitting him three times in the heart and killing him instantly. <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, a 17-year veteran, died several hours later. The blurred videotape made by the two journalism students recorded 26 shots in 3 -LCB- minutes, with 21 of those coming during the final 30-second volley that killed <PERSON> Connors </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Farm Giant's Complaints Prompted Commodities Exchange Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Complaints by a major grain processor about corrupt commodities traders sparked a federal undercover investigation at the nation's largest futures exchanges, a newspaper reported Saturday. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Archer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daniels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, first approached prosecutors under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> about two years ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> reported, quoting sources who were not named. A security guard answering the telephone at <ORGANIZATION> ADM </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters on Saturday said a company spokesman would not be available until Monday. The ADM complaint came at a time when federal prosecutors in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> were cracking down on insider trading on Wall Street. The seriousness of the allegations of fraud at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> prompted <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> to go after similar corruption in his region, the newspaper said. The investigation centers on allegations that as many as 100 traders at the two exchanges systematically cheated customers out of millions of dollars in executing trades. On Friday, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillogly </PERSON> would neither confirm nor deny the investigation, but the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> reported he and Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphaelson </PERSON> were the lead prosecutors on the case. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McLoughlin </PERSON> began working as trainees at <ORGANIZATION> ADM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the farm giant's commodities trading arm, in December 1986, and then acquired seats on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Burket </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> ADM </ORGANIZATION> vice president, told the newspaper the two were employed by the firm, but he would not comment further. In addition to the undercover agents, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> used six traders who were angry about alleged corruption to inform on their colleagues at the two exchanges, the <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> reported, also citing sources it did not name. About a year after the investigation began, the six were wired to record conversations on the frenzied trading floors and during social gatherings after work, the newspaper said. The two exchanges were served with subpoenas Thursday demanding records of trades. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Koshutko </PERSON> would neither confirm nor deny the investigation Friday, but two law enforcement officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed it Thursday. The complaint by <ORGANIZATION> ADM </ORGANIZATION> indicates that some traders who deal in tens of millions in futures contracts a year were victims of alleged fraud at the exchanges. While <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> and <PERSON> McLoughlin </PERSON> were trading in the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond and soybean pits at the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, two other <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents were trading currency at the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>, The <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Everybody is obviously concerned about what this means,'' <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON> said Friday. Commodities exchanges are hotbeds of capitalism in which speculators essentially bet millions of dollars on the future prices of goods ranging from gold to <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills to frozen orange juice. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents-turned-traders recorded conversations that suggest some trades were rigged to prevent customers from getting fair-market prices, and that some brokers sent false reports to customers to hide the skimming of profits of overcharges on commissions, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> has reported. Fourteen seats were sold at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> from Thursday, when the investigation was first reported, through the end of business Friday.

 <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> met with other Solidarity leaders on Saturday to draft the outlawed union's official answer to a communist party offer to legalize the labor group.

Attending the meeting were about 30 people, including members of the union's executive commission chaired by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and the senior union advisers. Late Saturday, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> left the meeting and returned home for the night, but the meeting continued. No union officials were available for comment, but a Solidarity source said an announcement of the meeting's results was expected Sunday. The urgent meeting was called by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> to respond to the announcement Thursday of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of a new stance endorsing more than one trade union organization. Currently, the only legal trade union alliance is the government-sanctioned OPZZ. The party offered to legalize Solidarity under terms to be negotiated if the union respects the law and agrees to help in reforming the economy. The party statement, agreed on at a stormy <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting earlier in the week, marked a dramatic reversal for the party and for Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>. In 1981 he declared martial law and interned thousands of people in order to crush Solidarity, which was banned the following year. But the worsening economic situation and the threat of an outburst of public unrest because of rising prices and consumer shortages have helped persuade officials to reassess Solidarity. The union is now seen as a potential partner that could help smooth the introduction of painful economic and political reforms that both sides agree on necessary. At a closed-door rally Friday, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he favored beginning as soon as possible `` round-table'' talks with the government that would lead to legalization, because the country's problems are so overwhelming. Responding to a worker saying the party always lies, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said, `` I do n't trust them either. But if someone gives a chance for pluralism, I take the chance.'' But there was some feeling among Solidarity supporters that the government should recognize their organization immediately so <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> could go to the talks officially as a union representative, and not as a private citizen. `` Solidarity has to be a side at the talks and not just a subject of discussion,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Henryk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON>, an adviser to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. `` Who is he there to represent, if not Solidarity?'' Earlier, at a Saturday morning rally of 4,000 workers at the Lenin shipyard in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, the leader of the shipyard Solidarity committee, <PERSON> Alojzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Szablewski </PERSON>, appealed to Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> and Industry Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilczek </PERSON> to rescind a decision to liquidate the yard as unprofitable. Such an action `` would be received with great relief by our work force and by the whole nation,'' <PERSON> Szablewski </PERSON> said. Liquidation of the yard officially began Dec. 1, but outwardly work there appears normal. Several private companies are opening up operations that would take over parts of the yard. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> attended the rally and was applauded by his fellow workers but did not address the crowd.

 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Saturday rejected calls to import more consumer goods to end shortages, saying it would not force the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to learn to manufacture its own products. He also attacked speculators hoarding laundry detergent, caviar, children's clothing and other items. A laundry soap shortage is plaguing Soviet mothers this winter. `` If we take a credit of a billion dollars and buy goods for one or two years, they will be in the market. But what will happen in the third year?'' he asked rhetorically in a speech to the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Communist Party conference. `` Will we continue not to produce anything ourselves?'' he said. That was the government policy when the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was enjoying the benefits of high oil prices, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in excerpts broadcast on the evening news. `` Instead of technical and scientific progress, instead of stimulating the economy, all faults were covered up with the wild sums the country got due to high oil prices,'' he said. That's all over now, he said. With oil prices down, `` we need to found our own industry,'' he said. `` We ca n't continue selling raw materials for Western consumer goods.'' Television cameras showed audience members hastily scribbling notes when <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> supported his argument with the shortage of laundry detergent and soap. In the first quarter of 1988, the government sold 80 tons of laundry detergent, and there was no shortage, he said. Yet this year, more than 200 tons has been sold, yet the soap is a rare find. Production of soap also has grown from 50 tons to 110 tons, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` Certain people are making money on the deficit, hoarding everything from black caviar to tights for children,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> charged. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also rejected calls for a crackdown on his opponents. He said it would be narrow-minded to `` employ the same old methods we are trying to give up, which we condemn'' while trying to democratize the country.

 The new president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> lobbed a surprise proclamation at reporters as he strolled around the White House grounds on Saturday. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced with great delight and drama that a doubles tennis match will be played at the White House courts between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s sons <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> against a team of professional tennis players who are friends of the Bushes, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Evert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shriver </PERSON>.

I am absolutely confident that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> boys will get over two games a set,'' the president added. He predicted a `` tremendous match'' with `` a lot of hostility.''

 With temperatures dipping to 64 degrees below zero Saturday, about 26,000 servicemen prepared for a mock battle in maneuvers described as `` the premier cold weather training exercise in the free world.'' But participants in Brim Frost'89 may be getting too much of a good thing. Overnight lows Saturday dipped to 50 degrees below zero or lower at 11 reporting stations in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, including 64 below zero at <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said orders were issued to field commanders allowing them to suspend the exercise if weather conditions become too severe. That means temperatures ranging from 30 below to 65 below. `` We do have some curtailment of activity this morning,'' <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON> said Saturday, although noting that the exercise still is primarily in its command and communication phase. About 26,000 servicemen, 120 aircraft and 1,000 vehicles from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> are participating in the $ 15 million biennial arctic training exercise, which military planners called the largest of its kind in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. Among the players are the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and reserve units, and Canadian land and air forces. The exercise is to conclude Feb. 1. Maneuvers are planned at more than 17 sites around <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, but the focus of the exercise will be a set piece battle between two Army brigades on the <ORGANIZATION> Tanana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Greely </LOCATION>, about 75 miles southeast of Fairbanks. That will include a battalion-sized Canadian force dropped into the arctic winter darkness by parachute. Planners said they were emphasizing safety throughout the maneuvers. `` Our track record has been very good,'' said Army Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fields </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, in charge of land forces during the exercise. `` Last month, 3,500 soldiers at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Greely </LOCATION> trained in weather that was 44 below zero and they came through the exercise with no serious cold-related injuries,'' Fields said. Army Maj. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tilman </PERSON> said the bitter cold produced ice fog which has restricted visibility in many areas. `` That has delayed some flights and stranded some flight crews around <ORGANIZATION> Eielson </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- today,'' he said. `` We're also having problems with metal fatigue and rubber fatigue on vehicles and aircraft,'' <PERSON> Tilman </PERSON> said. `` This kind of stuff -LRB- weather -RRB- is old hat to the military personnel stationed in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` But for guys like me from the Lower 48 -LRB- <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> McPherson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION> -RRB-, this is quite a learning experience. We're getting initiated fast.''

 Grieving relatives and friends gathered at memorial services Saturday to mourn the five school children slain by a camouflage-garbed, suicidal drifter. `` Although there are some people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> who do bad things, most of the people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> do good things,'' said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Busher </PERSON>, principal of <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where the killings and the woundings of 29 students and one teacher happened last Tuesday. `` The tragedy that occurred at our school could have happened anywhere. There is no way to protect us from this kind of tragedy ... this senseless tragedy. In time, some of the cutting edge of the pain will go away,'' <PERSON> Busher </PERSON> said. Her speech, at a memorial service attended by 200 people for the four Cambodian children killed, was translated as she spoke into the Cambodian language. `` Tragedy has followed you,'' state Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garamendi </PERSON> told the families, refugees from a country where more than 1 million people were killed in executions and enforced hardship after a 1975 communist takeover. The service, held in <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, was for 8-year-old <PERSON> Oeun </PERSON> <PERSON> Lim </PERSON>, 9-year-old Rathanan Or, 8-year-old <PERSON> Ram </PERSON> <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> and 6-year-old Sokhim An. During the morning, a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> funeral mass and burial were held for 6-year-old Thuy Tran, daughter of Vietnamese refugees. Another memorial service for the four Cambodians was planned Sunday at a mortuary. Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> planned to speak at a service Monday morning for all five children at Stockton Civic Auditorium. People attending that service were asked to follow a Southeast Asian cultural tradition and wear black-and-white ribbons. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>, who turned a gun on himself after firing more than 100 rounds from an AK-47 semi-automatic assault rifle at <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION>, where he had attended grade school, was buried Friday in an unmarked grave in a family plot at <LOCATION> Lodi </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Gun Dealers Say AK-47 Sales Up After Stockton Schoolyard Massacre</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sales of AK-47 assault rifles have increased at some gun stores since one was used in a schoolyard massacre, dealers said. One gun dealer said he plans to stop stocking the weapon, and concerns that distribution will be further restricted prompted the sales surge, sellers said. `` The gun was already a popular gun,'' <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, general manager of Western Surplus, said Friday. `` Now, everyone wants to get it before the distribution is stopped. It's having a profound effect on sales.'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>, 24, used a semi-automatic, Soviet-designed AK-47 rifle to shoot up an elementary schoolyard in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, on Tuesday. Five pupils were killed. Twenty-nine pupils and one teacher were wounded. <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> fired more than 100 rounds from the rifle and then killed himself with a handgun. Since then there have been calls to either ban the sale of such high-powered semiautomatic rifles or subject buyers to the same background check and waiting period required of handgun buyers. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said he used to sell three AK-47s a week but now is selling at least one a day. <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Noroian </PERSON>, who said he sells the rifle for $ 349 at Art's Guns in <LOCATION> Reseda </LOCATION>, estimated the price could go as high as $ 800 if sales are restricted or the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> passes a law banning the gun. `` It's trendy,'' <PERSON> Noroian </PERSON> said. `` Everybody wants to buy the gun. They're fun to shoot. They're outstanding to shoot. It's exhilarating It's just a lot of fun.'' He said his sales of the gun also increased after the shooting, but declined to provide figures. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>, owner of B & amp; B Sales in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> and Westminster, said he sold 4,500 AK-47s over the last year. Most of the volume was wholesale to other dealers but there also were many retail sales, he said. Sales increased as soon as the public perceived through the press that they might be restricted, <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> said Saturday. <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> said veterans of <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> buy AK-47s as nostalgia items for display and many people buy paramilitary-style weapons because they are the latest in technology and use them for family outings to shooting ranges. One Orange County dealer, <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Garell </PERSON>, said he would quit stocking the rifle at The Grant Boys store in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>. `` The handwriting is on the wall that these types of weapons with massive firepower have little true purpose,'' said <PERSON> Garell </PERSON>, who also sells camping and outdoor gear. `` I believe they are going to be banned eventually.''

 Crab meat with duxelle sauce and chocolate-covered macadamia nuts is n't the usual bill of fare for the homeless, but that was on the menu Saturday after celebrity chefs ousted from a fund-raising event decided to cook instead for those who ca n't pay. `` We normally serve a very nice meal, a hot meal with either fresh fruit salad or fresh green salad. But ... we do n't serve clams or crab. People around here got all perky about that,'' said <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> of the Community for Creative Non-Violence, which runs the homeless shelter. A commercial event had been scheduled for Saturday night and Sunday, charging $ 50 per ticket for Saturday night and $ 15 for the Sunday Super Bowl party. The for-profit organization planning it, A Taste of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, had expected to donate $ 150,000 to $ 300,000 in profits to the homeless shelter, said spokeswomen for the sponsoring group. But the event was canceled because of last-minute contract problems with the DC Armory, they said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalrymple </PERSON>, general manager of the armory, did not immediately return a phone call to his home Saturday. `` Obviously, we could use the money and we're sorry that did n't work out,'' <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said `` At least people in our shelter are going to get one nice meal.'' The dismayed chefs, who had brought some of their food with them, met Friday to decide what to do. `` We had a choice whether we should pick up and go, but we decided we were here to help the hungry and homeless, so why do n't we? said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, owner and chef of Windows On the Water in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. When President and Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stop by his restaurant, he usually serves them lobster-stuffed potatoes, and he had intended to make the same dish for the A Taste of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> event. But he managed to stop the shipment of 160 pounds of lobster. `` It would have cost us $ 2,000,'' said his wife, <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON>. `` We're a small business We ca n't absorb that.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Weichman </PERSON> of All Seasons restaurant in Mobile, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, had brought more than $ 500 worth of crab meat with him, and <PERSON> Filippo </PERSON> <PERSON> Milone </PERSON> of The Pillars Restaurant, also in Mobile, who had canceled his shipment of crab meat, offered to split the cost. Referring to the homeless shelter residents, <PERSON> Weichman </PERSON> said, `` Hopefully, they'll have a memorable meal and they'll realize they ate as well as some of the fat cats.'' There appeared to be no clash of egos as the chefs whirled around the shelter's kitchen, directing college volunteers on the proper way to slice potatoes, chop carrots and open and mix cans of tomato paste with whole tomatoes. `` Broccoli au gratin,'' <PERSON> Weichman </PERSON> pronounced as crates of broccoli appeared in the kitchen. `` You got ta be flexible,'' he said, explaining the instant addition to the menu. `` We'll make a good pasta with crab sauce, whatever,'' said <PERSON> Milone </PERSON>, reflecting the ad hoc menu decisions. In addition to the crab meat with a sauce of bell pepper, onions, mushrooms and pimentos, the chefs prepared a dish of roasted garlic potatoes, pasta with a red sauce as well as a lamb dish and salad. Chef <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiebaut </PERSON> of the Mauna Kea Beach Resort in <LOCATION> Kohala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, got his company to donate the lamb, fruit and special colored chocolate-covered macadamia nuts. <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> surveyed the busy scene in his kitchen at 2 p.m. and asked warily, `` You can get this dinner done by 5 p.m.?'' `` No problem,'' <PERSON> Weichman </PERSON> responded. <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, who runs the 1,400-person homeless shelter, said he expected the residents to be thrilled by the culinary change of pace, but some waited to be impressed. `` It'll probably be all right,'' said <PERSON> Ronnell </PERSON> <PERSON> Showell </PERSON>, 29, of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, who, after thinking about it a moment, added, `` It should be all right.'' <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 51, also of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said, `` I think it's a very good idea. ... I'm thankful for everything we get.'' <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said the money that had been expected from the commercial event would have been used to renovate a theater next to the shelter, a project that will cost about $ 250,000. `` We've discovered that cultural activities, theatrical activities, are very important to the people here,'' he said. There are no plans to build another shelter now. `` We already operate the largest shelter in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said. `` We're trying to make this as complete a model as possible so people here have the greatest chance possible to get out of here ... to help their transition back to the real world.''

<HEAD>Soviet Deficit Could Pass U.S. Red Ink in 1990</HEAD>

 The ballooning Soviet budget deficit could pass the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deficit in 1990, according to figures published in a Soviet newspaper Saturday. Driven by the cost of the Chernobyl clean-up, a crash program to solve shortages of housing and consumer goods, and reconstruction after the Armenian earthquake, Soviet red ink could nearly double next year to 100 billion rubles, or $ 162 billion. That figure, calculated by research economist O.T. <PERSON> Bogomolov </PERSON> and reported in the newspaper Arguments and Facts, is higher than estimates for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deficit for 1989, which range from $ 127 billion to $ 141 billion. Worse, it looms as a far greater percentage of the Soviet economy _ 11 percent of gross national product compared to 3 percent to 4 percent in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bogomolov </PERSON> said. The economist blamed the deficit in part on the declining price of oil, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s primary export; and the anti-alcohol campaign, which cost $ 65 billion in lost tax revenue. He also cited `` urgent social problems,'' apparently referring to the Soviet government's decision to boost spending on housing and consumer goods this year to appease an unhappy population. In addition, the cost of reconstructing the area devastated by the Armenian earthquake is estimated at more than $ 13 billion during the next two years. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said last week that Soviet financial problems were so pressing that even the defense budget would have to be cut. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> first admitted to a budget deficit last autumn, saying it has been running in the red for years while telling Soviet citizens it was producing an annual surplus. Finance Minister <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gostev </PERSON> projected a deficit of $ 55 billion on a 1989 government budget of $ 795 billion. However, some Western economists say the severity of a deficit is determined by its proportion to the entire economy, not just the government budget. They say that is a better indicator of how far a nation can afford to go into debt. Until Saturday, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had not revealed the size of its economy. But in reporting the 1988 economic statistics, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday that the Soviet gross national product grew 5 percent to $ 1.4 trillion dollars in 1988. That would be a strong increase if it did not include inflation, but the government newspaper did not say. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> first acknowledged that it suffers from inflation last year, but officials said they had not yet calculated the rate. Overall, <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> Soviet expert <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Feshbach </PERSON> evaluated the economic performance described in the <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> report as `` not enough progress _ but not failing badly either.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> report said one out of 10 enterprises in the country was losing money, and only 12 percent of high schools have a single ersonal computer. Although the economic news was mixed, <PERSON> Feshbach </PERSON> noted the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had progressed substantially in reducing the extremely high infant mortality rate. The national figure dropped from 25.4 to 24 deaths per 1,000 births. However, that does not include deaths in the first six days of life. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the infant mortality rate in Central <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION> ranges as high as 51.4 deaths per 1,000, due to insufficient medical care and `` unfavorable conditions of women's work. Alcohol-related crime and toxic air pollution also decreased, <PERSON> Feshbach </PERSON> said.

 Officials at a troubled District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> prison complex spent Saturday cleaning up from a series of fires that left one prisoner dead, another injured, and gutted an administration building. Inmates took advantage of a power failure that occurred Friday night to set a series of fires, according to <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>. Two inmates were stabbed during the disturbance, a press release issued Saturday by the <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> said. Both were taken to <ORGANIZATION> Dewitt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> at nearby <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belvoir </LOCATION>, where one of the inmates was pronounced dead. The dead inmate was identified as <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>. The other prisoner, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON>, 36, a <LOCATION> Shelby </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, native, was taken by helicopter from <LOCATION> Dewitt </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, where he is listed in stable condition. <PERSON> Gill </PERSON>, who is eligible for parole in August 1996, is serving a five - to 15-year sentence for rape and several other convictions <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> had been convicted of simple assault but was also serving two to five years for unauthorized use of a vehicle. He would have been eligible for parole in 1990. One blaze engulfed the prison's main adminstration building, as <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, firefighters refusing to enter the grounds stood by for more than an hour. They said they were waiting until prison guards could contain inmates who roamed the grounds freely. A damaged heating system, smoke and water at one of the complex's 25 dormitories forced prison officials to move about 60 prisoners to the <LOCATION> D.C </LOCATION> Jail. Officials have said the prisoners will probably spend another night there. Damage estimates from the fires have not been released. The prison _ one of 10 correctional institutions in the <LOCATION> Lorton </LOCATION> complex _ is about 20 miles south of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and held 6,165 prisoners last month. District Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who came to the city-run prison complex from a presidential inaugural celebration at the city's convention center by helicopter, downplayed the incident. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> was accompanied by his wife, <PERSON> Effi </PERSON>. Rating the incident at two `` on a scale of one to 10,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said, `` it could have been a lot worse.'' Corrections officials said a power outage had briefly knocked out the lights at the facility. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Falls </PERSON>, an operations manager at the <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday that about 620 customers in the nearby <LOCATION> Occoquan </LOCATION> area of <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> loss power from 9:15 p.m. until about 10:13 p.m. Friday. But he said he had not been notified that the prison had experienced an outage. At least four fires were set during the incident, according to Lt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> fire department. Ms. <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> said the fires which began at about 9:30 p.m. were brought under control at about 2:30 a.m.. One blaze destroyed the main administration building for the medium-security central facility One dormitory and a supply unit also received `` minor damage,'' Ms. <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> said. Police from <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, the district and <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> ringed the outer fences to guard against escape attempts, county officials said. All inmates were accounted for within about four hours after the fires started. Members of the <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> police department's special operations division and civil disturbance unit _ some on overtime duty because of the events surrounding President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inauguration _ went to the scene, as did about a half dozen <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> fire department units, police said. The disturbance was the latest in a series of problems plaguing the city prison system, including escapes, accusations of drug dealing inside prison walls, disorders and years of litigation to reduce chronic overcrowding. But corrections director <PERSON> Hallem </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said early Saturday the disturbance was not caused by overcrowding. `` We are in compliance with the cap and overcrowding was not the issue,'' he said. In July 1986, fires set by inmates destroyed four dormitories at the <LOCATION> Occoquan </LOCATION> area of the correctional complex. That blaze was blamed for severely intensifying the crowding that has plagued the prison system.

<HEAD>Dissidents Form Major Coalition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Dissidents formed a major coalition Saturday and vowed to drive out foreign forces, end <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> influence on the government and pursue unification talks with communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The umbrella dissident group, tentatively named the <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, was inaugurated at <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and immediately called an anti-government rally Sunday in downtown <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. About 3,000 supporters shouting anti-U.S. and anti-government slogans attended the rally at <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Riot police stood guard outside the campus but did not intervene. The coalition, the largest in recent years with its members coming from labor, religion and other circles, characterized the government of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> as a front for military dictatorship. It declared a campaign to drive out `` foreign forces'' such as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and end annual joint military exercises between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to help advance unification of the divided <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. Coalition leaders stressed strategic ties with what they called conservative opposition parties led by <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON>, despite criticism of their failure to produce a single candidate in the last presidential election. The two Kims have been criticized for splitting the opposition vote and help <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> win the election in December 1987. Opposition parties welcomed the coalition but said it should adopt a moderate line and oppose revolutionary changes. Some government officials have accused dissidents and radical students of trying to topple the government by force and set up a leftist regime. The coalition resolved to pursue unification talks with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and proposed a working-level meeting be held on March 1 at the border truce village of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> to disscuss arrangements for full-scale talks between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> representatives. The dissidents called for an end to alleged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interference in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> affairs and defined their goals to realize `` genuine liberation, freedom and justice.''

<HEAD>Anti-Abortion, Pro-Choice Activists Mark Anniversary of Ruling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Anti-abortion forces marked the 16th anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision legalizing abortion on Saturday with demonstrations across the country, prompting more than 400 arrests and a clash with pro-choice activists in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, the lawyer who successfully argued the landmark abortion case in 1973 said that for the first time she is seriously concerned that the <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision may be overturned. Hundreds of demonstrators turned out in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to protest the day before the anniversary of the abortion ruling. But in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, about 200 people gathered to support the legal right to an abortion. In <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, about 500 anti-abortion protesters blocked the entrance of a <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> women's clinic, which led to 184 arrests, including three for assault, police said. `` They were just abusive, violent people,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Finkel </PERSON>, medical director of the <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phoenix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION>, who was assaulted during the protest. In <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, a fight broke out between a group of anti-abortion demonstrators and pro-choice activists outside a <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> clinic, resulting in 55 arrests, police said. Most of those arrested outside East GYN Center were members of <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION>, an anti-abortion group that has been coordinating protests nationally since this summer, said police spokeswoman <PERSON> Allene </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>. The scuffle broke out just after 8 a.m. as 130 protesters gathered to block the entrance to the abortion clinic, police said. No injuries were reported, police said. Protests were peaceful elsewhere in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, about 200 people were arrested at an anti-abortion demonstration in front of a family planning clinic in <LOCATION> Sunnyvale </LOCATION> that attracted counterdemonstrators, police said. An estimated 600 people either opposed to or in favor of abortions participated in the demonstration at the Family Planning Alternative Clinic, police said. About 400 members of <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of anti-abortion groups including many who belong to Operation Rescue, appeared in front of the clinic at 8 a.m., chanting, singing and attempting to block the facility's door, said police Capt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, a crowd of 200 pro-choice activists listened to folk music and speeches at the state's old Capitol in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>. `` I come to you at a time when women are saying we will not go back,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Reesce </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyner </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>. His audience carried signs with slogans like `` Keep Your Laws Off My Body,'' `` My Body My Choice'' and `` If men could get pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament.'' In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, about 400 people gathered on the steps of the Hale Boggs Federal Building for the Right to Life rally and march in the city's central business district. `` We are standing here for the rights of the unborn,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanks </PERSON>. `` We are taking a stand against what we believe is a criminal act made possible by <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> <PERSON> versus </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> 16 years ago.'' In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, about 3,000 anti-abortion protesters marched through downtown <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> Saturday and held a rally near the state Capitol. Pro-choice activists in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> held a later rally and candlelight vigil on the Capitol steps. Their concern about a possible reversal of <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> stems from the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s intention to review a federal appeals court ruling that struck down key provisions of a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law regulating abortions. `` I've never truly worried before,'' said <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Weddington </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> lawyer who successfully argued the <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> case, adding that there is a potential for a rare turnaround by the justices. `` I ca n't count five votes'' on the nine-member court supporting legal abortions, she said Friday in a telephone interview prior to a weekend speaking engagement at <ORGANIZATION> Bowdoin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>.

 A 7-year-old boy appointed to the city <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> after he worked for the re-election of a councilman attended his first meeting Saturday and proposed some attacks on poverty. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, who looked bored at times, sat through an hour of plodding discussion by fellow commissioners and school officials on topics such as student motivation and high school assemblies. But then <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON>, as he's known, rose to tackle an even more serious subject. `` I propose we join together to help the poor and homeless children,'' he said. His suggestions included soliciting contributions from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> and the city Police Department; helping `` children in need'' get haircuts; collecting books, toys and clothing for homeless children; and distributing them in ways that will not humiliate the youngsters. `` Not only will these points help the homeless and needy children of <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, they will help in the fight against drugs,'' said <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>. `` What if you were homeless or poor, had no clothes, shoes or decent recreation program? Some guy comes up to you and says, ` Hey kid, I ` ll give you $ 50 to carry my drugs.''' The young commissioner _ dressed in blue jeans, scuffed white sneakers and a black sweatshirt _ said he came prepared for the meeting, held in the gymnasium at the <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luther </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jr. </ORGANIZATION> recreation center in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. He said he wrote to both the university and police about his ideas, found two bookstores willing to donate books and persuaded several establishments to donate haircuts. `` Let us show the world we can make a difference,'' he said. The rest of the <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> endorsed his proposals and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinbarger </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Berkeley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> on the Homeless, said the youngster's ideas, among others, will be discussed at an educational workshop for the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> later this month.

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaize </PERSON> was ousted as political leader of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> during a party convention vote Saturday night, and replaced with his long-time critic, <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. The election of <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, by a delegate vote of 190-154, means he will be <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>'s next prime minister if the centrist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> wins in elections due by December. <PERSON> Blaize </PERSON> will remain prime minister until the elections. Though the press was excluded from the convention, held in <LOCATION> Grenville </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island's east coast, proceedings could be heard from outside the building through a loudspeaker. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, 43, minister of <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION>, has regularly criticized <PERSON> Blaize </PERSON> for taking major decisions without consulting his cabinet. It had been rumored for months that he would challenge <PERSON> Blaize </PERSON>'s party leadership. <PERSON> Blaize </PERSON>'s ouster as party leader was apparently due to his drop in popularity, especially among the young, and his ill health. At 71, <PERSON> Blaize </PERSON> is suffering from prostate cancer and an old spine injury. He recently returned from several days of hospitalization in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Blaize </PERSON>, who was the party's leader since 1960, became prime minster when his party was elected in December 1984, replacing an interim government that had ruled since the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> in October 1983. <PERSON> Blaize </PERSON>'s party originally controlled 14 of the 15 seats in parliament, but the defection of elected party officials due to disputes with <PERSON> Blaize </PERSON> reduced his party's majority to nine seats. Defecting party members created an opposition party called the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Demoratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which now controls the remaining six seats. The invasion ousted a hard-line Marxist regime that came to power in a bloody coup against leftist Prime Minister <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>, who was assassinated by extremist members of his own government.

 Foreign ministers from six Southeast Asian nations said in a statement Saturday that former Cambodian head of state Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> should lead any future government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet whose engine fell off just after takeoff had not yet undergone safety modifications ordered by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, a federal official said Saturday. The official said, however, that it was too soon to know whether the modification could have been a factor in preventing the incident Friday, in which no one was injured. The right engine tore away from the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-200 jet on Piedmont Flight 1480 as the plane left <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Two months earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> ordered all <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-200 engines to be equipped with additional engine supports. `` The modification had not been performed on this airplane,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, who is heading an investigation for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> order said the support could be added anytime within the next 4,000 landings, and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> said he believed the aircraft had not made that many subsequent landings. The engine, which fell in a field at the airport, was being examined at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> and portions of the plane's engine mount were to be sent to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for analysis, he said. The investigation was not focusing on any one possible cause, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> said at a news conference at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>. He said he would be reviewing maintenance records for the <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> plane, which was built in 1981. Friday's incident was the second one of its type in 13 months. Last January, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> ordered airlines to inspect some engine-mount bolts on <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-200 aircraft for cracks after an engine fell off a <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> flight shortly after takeoff from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> on Dec. 5, 1987, said <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-200 has two engines, one mounted under each wing. The plane, which can carry about 125 passengers, is designed to fly on one engine, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>, which owns <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION>. In both incidents, the pilots were able to land the planes with the one remaining engine and no injuries were reported. But in 1979, an engine separation led to the worst air disaster in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history, when an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 crashed just after takeoff from <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>, killing 273 people.

 Restaurant owners are taking a dim view of a crackdown by fire inspectors, who have been by snuffing out candles and other open flames in establishments that failed to get the required inspection and approval. `` There must be another planet we can go to where they'd allow a candlelight dinner,'' said <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulaski </PERSON>, general manager of the Tin Angel, a cliffside restaurant and lounge. `` It all seems a little preposterous,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosagrande </PERSON>, owner of Brandy's restaurant. `` How am I supposed to keep a chafing dish warm or to use butter warmers for crab legs?'' <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeliesko </PERSON>, co-owner of Tramps downtown, said his restaurant has been darker since fire inspectors ordered him to remove glass-enclosed candles from 40 tables. `` At first we were astounded when these guys came in with their fire hats on,'' <PERSON> Zeliesko </PERSON> said. `` I've seen candles in every restaurant I've eaten at, all over town. But it's really not funny when you realize they could cost you business.'' Violators also can be fined $ 1,000. Fire Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Friel </PERSON> said if the restaurants would seek permission, and an inspection shows they have a good sprinkler system and fireproof construction, `` we might be able to give them an OK.''

 Two men waiting to throw dynamite at a plane carrying author and activist <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Llosa </PERSON> shot and wounded four people when their attempt was foiled, a newspaper reported Saturday. The daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Expreso </ORGANIZATION> reported the plane belonging to the domestic airline <ORGANIZATION> Faucett </ORGANIZATION> had just landed Thursday in <LOCATION> Pucallpa </LOCATION>, 355 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, and was taxing to a halt when the incident occurred.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Saturday called for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to put pressure <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> so that a permanent truce in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war can go into effect. A commentary broadcast on <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> and reported by the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said a deadline should be set for putting into effect a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution that calls for troop withdrawals, prisoner exchanges and peace talks. A U.N.-mediated cease-fire in the eight-year gulf war took effect Aug. 20, but peace talks that opened in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> five days later broke down immediately. The commentary, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said the way to ensure progress in the peace talks was for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to apply `` corrective discipline'' to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The commentary did not mention specific sanctions but appealed to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> `` to think of other devices for implementing the resolution.'' It also called for `` more serious international actions'' to pressure <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> into withdrawing from Iranian territory it occupied during the war and freeing prisoners of war. The commentary was aired shortly before a special <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> envoy, <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliasson </PERSON>, was due in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in an effort to restart stalled peace talks between the gulf war foes. The Swedish <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador was to arrive in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Jan. 23 and travel to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> Jan. 27. Three rounds of peace talks have failed to resolve the deadlock over troop pullouts to prewar borders. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Security Council Resolution 598 calls on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to halt ` all military activities'' and honor the truce, withdraw troops to prewar borders, exchange around 100,000 prisoners of war and start peace talks. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> `` firmly believes a final date for execution of the Resolution should be set,'' <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported the radio as saying. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> occupies 259 square miles of Iranian territory and refuses to pull out until <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> gives up the right to search ships in the gulf for Iraq-bound war cargo. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which has not stopped any <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> ship since the cease-fire, insists that troop withdrawals must be the next stage in the peace process. On Friday, <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s tactics were blocking peace talks, citing <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s refusal to exchange sick and wounded POWs as a major obstacle to progress in the negotiations. An exchange of 1,158 sick and disabled POWs sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> in November collapsed four days after it began, amid mutual recriminations over the numbers to be repatriated. A total of 155 Iraqi and 56 Iranian POWs were freed before the operation broke down Nov. 27. On Saturday, a senior <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> official said the organization will begin Monday repatriating 255 Iranian prisoners of war that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> unilaterally decided to release earlier this month. The official, <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Luethold </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that a plane chartered by the Swiss relief agency will fly about half the Iranian prisoners to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> on Monday. He said the Iranians already have been examined by <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> medical staff but declined to say whether all of them are willing to be repatriated. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> says it has registered 50,182 Iraqi and 19,284 Iranian POWs but estimates the total number of prisoners at more than 100,000. Before the failed November exchange, the two sides had exchanged 765 sick and wounded <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> and 613 Iranian POWs.

<TEXT>
 The government said Saturday it will still try to recover billions from <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> even if he dies. A key senator said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> may be allowed to return if he gives back money he allegedly stole and apologizes publicly. `` The government will not be prejudiced by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' death,'' Justice Secretary <PERSON> Sedfrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON> told reporters. `` And it would be doubly difficult for his heirs or any appointed administrator of his estate to touch his alleged Swiss bank deposits.'' <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON> made the comment following reports from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> that the ousted <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> president is in declining health and suffered a collapsed lung Thursday. Concern over <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' health prompted a federal judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to postpone until next month a hearing on whether <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is too ill to be arraigned on racketeering charges. <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON> said the government could pursue its 35 civil suits against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' estate if the former president dies. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government has never filed criminal charges against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> for fear he would demand his right to return to face his accusers. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has lived in exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> since a 1986 civilian-military uprising toppled his 20-year administration and propelled Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> into power. Critics say <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> accumulated $ 5 billion to $ 10 billion during his administration. Also Saturday, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jovito </PERSON> <PERSON> Salonga </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> might be allowed to return home if he returns allegedly stolen funds and issues a public apology as <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s disgraced former president, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>, did last year `` If <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> decides to do a <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> _ that is, make a public apology, seek our people's forgiveness and restore his ill-gotten wealth _ there will be enough time for the former president and his lawyers to initiate a plea - bargaining process.. with the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> courts and prosecutors ... authorities in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and the government of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Salonga </PERSON> <PERSON> Salonga </PERSON> added that if <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> `` decides to insist on his innocence and refuses to do a <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>, the Aquino government may no longer be blamed for refusing to consider his return.'' <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> made a public apology to his country Nov. 23, surrendered assets worth $ 24 million and went into rural exile in a remote temple. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> president, who formerly chaired a committee leading a worldwide search for money <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is accused of stealing, made his remarks to a lawyer's group in the central port city of <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Thousands marched in a cold, heavy rain through the center of this restive northern city Saturday, demanding the government open talks with the Basque separatist group <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION>. The march, which authorities said drew an estimated 18,000 people, was organized by the radical Basque nationalist party <PERSON> Herri </PERSON> <PERSON> Batasuna </PERSON>, widely considered the political arm of <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> has claimed responsibility for more than 600 deaths since 1968, when it began fighting for independence for the three-province northern Basque region. The demonstrators carried a wide banner bearing the phrase `` for the negotiation toward peace'' and shouted slogans in favor of ETA and for negotiations. The march was peaceful and guarded by national police, said <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Campuzano </PERSON>, a spokesman of the <LOCATION> Vizcaya </LOCATION> province civil governor's office. <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION>, an acronym for Basque land and liberty in the Basque language, declared Jan. 8 it would stop attacks for 15 days to press the government to enter negotiations on the future of the Basque region. But the government of Socialist Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> has asked <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> for an indefinite `` cease-fire'' as a condition for resuming talks cut off a year ago after an <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> attack, according to a report published in the leading <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pais </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Pais </PERSON>, citing government sources, reported Jan. 15 the talks were to be resumed in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Eugenio </PERSON> `` Antxon'' <PERSON> Etxebeste </PERSON> and other leaders of the organization are exiled.

 Foreigners who took part in a `` peace caravan'' demanded a government apology Saturday after military roadblocks stopped them from reaching a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval base to stage a protest rally. A joint statement of the 200 foreigners who attended the <ORGANIZATION> Asia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> said the roadblocks were a `` theater of the absurd ... `` We demand an apology from the -LRB- President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> government, more particularly the military, over the way its foreign guests were treated and intimidated,'' it added. The foreigners, mostly Australians and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealanders </LOCATION>, said their 200-vehicle peace caravan was stopped Friday in 16 military and police checkpoints in a 30-mile stretch from <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> to the Subic Bay naval base in <LOCATION> Olongapo </LOCATION>, 50 miles west of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. The protesters, who included prominent Filipino activists and Australian Sen. <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentinne </PERSON>, planned a rally in <LOCATION> Olongapo </LOCATION> but gave up the idea because the roadblocks prevented them from reaching the naval base city before their parade permit expired at 5 p.m. Friday. The soldiers said they were looking for weapons and infiltrators from communist rebel or other groups. Earlier, civilian and military officials threatened to deport peace activists who made contact with communist rebels. At least 10,000 residents of <LOCATION> Olongapo </LOCATION> turned out for a boisterous pro-bases rally Friday. Most of the 150,000 <LOCATION> Olongapo </LOCATION> residents depend on the base for their livelihood. In the statement, issued Saturday, the foreign peace activists criticized the organizers of the pro-bases rally for playing on the residents economic benefits from the base. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintains six military installations in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, and their lease expires in 1991.

 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, in his first full day on the new job, pledged Saturday to remember his small-town midwestern values and `` to live up to the awesome trust you have placed in me.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> spent much of his first full day as vice president at his new home, the vice president's residence at the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He relaxed and made final touches to the text of his first formal speech as vice president, which he delivered at an evening `` Tribute to Democracy'' at Constitution Hall. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also made plans to conduct his first official acts as vice president Monday morning. At the request of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is to administer oaths of office to the new presidential and vice presidential staffs in the White House's East Room, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> press secretary <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> scheduled a mid-morning meeting on Monday with anti-abortion leaders, which <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON> said was being held in conjunction with the anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s decision upholding the right of women to have abortions. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, his wife <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> and their three children planned to return to their suburban <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> home Sunday, <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON> said. The electricity in the official residence will be shut off for several days of repairs and renovations, and they will wait a week or more before moving back in, he said. Before his speech, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> stopped in on some of the final inaugural events _ receptions with members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the diplomatic corps. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> heard a performance by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir at the Constitution Hall before delivering a speech in which he praised the `` common sense and plain wisdom of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' `` First in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, then in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, now in the vice presidency, I have tried and will continue to try to live according to the values I learned in <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` And I'll work to make sure our government lives up to the expectations of the decent, hard-working citizens of <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> _ and of the thousands of towns and suburbs and cities across our nation.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the new administration `` will be judged, and it will deserve to be judged, by how well it does in securing the blessings of liberty to ourselves and extending those blessings to others.'' He said it will also be judged `` by how well we succeed in sharing and deepening the enjoyment of the blessings of liberty here at home.'' `` On this first day of the Bush-Quayle administration, I pledge to you that with every ounce of my energy and ability, I will seek to live up to the awesome trust you have placed in me,'' he said. He cited the words of another former vice president from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, who once said: `` Those who know nothing are placed in the seats of the high and mighty. The wise men remain at home and discuss public questions on the ends of street cars and around barber shops.'' `` Well,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` I intend to ` remain at home' in my thinking even as I have to occupy high offices here in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' The vice president, as he did during the campaign, reminded the crowd that he was named for <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, a friend of his parents who was killed in service in World War II. In a prepared text he had recalled that Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` mockingly'' referred to his name as `` <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>,'' but he omitted that in reading the speech. `` I bear my name proudly, ladies and gentlemen, because it reminds me of the incalculable debt we owe to those who have sacrificed their all so that we may live our lives in freedom and peace,'' he said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and his wife danced until well past midnight at Friday night's inaugural balls, stopping at 14 events as they crossed the city by motorcade. At one stop <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told of his unease at the new protocol that placed him ahead of former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> upon departing the inauguration. He said he and <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> `` went out behind the Bushes'' _ and then paused as the ballroom filled with laughter over what he'd said. Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> put her hand to her face in embarrassment. `` <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> could do no better,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said finally, laughing at himself.

<HEAD>Study Finds Blacks Twice As Likely To Have Loan Applications Rejected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Blacks are twice as likely as whites to have their applications for home loans rejected by savings and loan associations, a newspaper reported. The records of 10 million applications from savings and loans show a lending gap so wide that in much of the country, high-income blacks are rejected at the same rate as low-income whites, said a report in Sunday's combined editions of The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution. The Journal-Constitution said it studied government records of $ 1 trillion in loan applications between 1983 and mid-1988 at the nation's 3,100 savings and loan associations and mutual savings banks, which make 50 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> home loans. `` On the face of it, it looks like what you have there is a great big red flag,'' said <PERSON> Jerauld </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kluckman </PERSON>, director of compliance programs for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates savings and loans. The rejection rates were derived from computerized summaries of loan applications sorted by race, sex and marital status in the newspaper study. The raw statistics were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. In settling a civil rights suit 10 years ago, the board agreed to collect and analyze the statistics. Each year since, it has collected the numbers and stored them in a computer, but never has analyzed them, the newspaper said. Loan statistics do not by themselves prove discrimination, since they reveal nothing about the debt burdens or credit histories of applicants. But <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> regulations say statistical disparities should be examined for clues that might reveal illegal discrimination. `` I ca n't argue with the numbers,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION>. `` Clearly we've got a problem, and the powers that be have got to agree on a way to deal with it. The records show that blacks, besides being rejected more than twice as often as whites, withdraw applications 22 percent more often and receive no decision on loan applications 10 percent more often. Counting these factors, 50 percent of blacks who fill out loan applications receive loans, compared with 74 percent of whites.

 Six white supremacists marched through downtown Saturday surrounded by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> troops in riot gear as hundreds of angry counterdemonstrators hurled bricks, rocks and insults at them. A half-dozen law enforcement officers were injured as violence broke out along the route and in spots throughout downtown after the march. Police reported 42 arrests. Two thousand police officers and National Guardsmen surrounded the Capitol and lined the mile-long march route, trying to keep about 1,000 counterdemonstrators away from the white supremacists. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bankhead </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION>, said the counterdemonstrators overwhelmed the security forces at some points. The white supremacists said they completed their march battered from being hit with debris, but without serious injuries. `` I would n't call it a riot,'' said Public Safety Commissioner <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Napper </PERSON>, who was quickly surrounded by an angry crowd of about 50 people when he appeared downtown after the march. `` It's an unusual situation that we're going to contain.'' He told the crowd the white supremacists had a right to march, adding, `` They're entitled to protection. it's not always easy.'' The six marchers were among 10 white supremacists who had rallied at the state Capitol, marking the second anniversary of clashes between civil rights marchers and white onlookers in neighboring <LOCATION> Forsyth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Rally organizer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> lawyer and leader of the white supremacist <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, had predicted 1,000 supporters would attend his rally and march, which also was a protest of last week's observances honoring the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` People ask me, ` Where are your numbers?''' <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> told the nine supporters at the Capitol. `` How many people were at Kitty Hawk -LRB- where the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> brothers made their historic flight -RRB-? I do n't know, but it changed the course of history I have the spirit of Kitty Hawk in my heart.'' As <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>'s group walked from the Capitol to near The Omni sports arena, they were surrounded by riot-helmeted Guardsmen, massed shoulder to shoulder, who covered almost a full city block. The Guardsmen were led by a convoy that included 12 motorcycle officers, four police cars, two dozen officers on foot, two police buses and two vans. At the end of the route, the marchers were met by dozens of youths throwing bottles, bricks and other objects. The violence scattered dozens of curious bystanders, including conventioneers in town for a homebuilders trade show. When the convoy turned around and marched back to the Capitol, the melee continued, with more rocks and bottles tossed at the group. After the march, hundreds of people milled about at spots throughout downtown. Vandals at the Underground <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> shopping and entertainment complex, which is under construction, threw building materials. Police used riot shields and clubs to disperse the crowds, and several people were seen struck by policemen wielding billy clubs. By sundown, the streets downtown were quiet. At a City Hall news conference, <PERSON> Napper </PERSON> said he thought police handled the day's events well. He said <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> historically has been able to work out its racial conflicts, adding, `` I think that's why we have n't had the kind of situations that took place in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>.'' During the melee, a police officer was knocked unconscious by a flying rock, a National Guardsman was injured by a brick that hit his foot, the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> said several of its agents were hurt, and <PERSON> Grady </PERSON> <PERSON> Hospital </PERSON> said it was treating two officers from the state Department of Natural Resources. <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>'s rally and march was billed as a resumption of one canceled at the last minute in July by police on the eve of the Democratic National Convention. That march was canceled as about 500 counterdemonstrators gathered and police feared violence. As troops waited for <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>'s rally to begin, a loudspeaker blared a song proclaiming, `` If the South would have won, we'd have it made.'' A few blocks away, about 1,000 people gathered at <LOCATION> Woodruff </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> to demonstrate against the supremacists. Participants, ranging from clean-cut <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students to punk rockers to street people, were separated from the streets that the white supremacist marchers were to take by 100 police officers. The counterdemonstration was organized by a New York-based group called the <ORGANIZATION> Partisan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which bills itself as a Trotskyist-socialist organization. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Herson </PERSON>, a member of the group, said it was not seeking a violent confrontation but wanted to make a statement of its own. He said the white supremacist march was `` a provocation in a city that is predominantly black, has a large Jewish population and is strong in trade unions. These are all things the Klan is against.'' <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> said his rally was intended to repudiate the holiday marking King's birthday. `` The theme of the march is ` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> arise _ no King over us,'' he said earlier on the steps of the <ORGANIZATION> Forsyth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courthouse </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cumming </LOCATION>, a virtually all-white community 40 miles north of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Forsyth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials refused to permit him to use a podium or loudspeakers or to put up his <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag because he was denied a permit for a full demonstration. `` Me without my flag is like <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> without his cigar,'' <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> told Sheriff <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Walraven </PERSON>. `` If you had a permit, we'd let you fly that little old flag all over the place,'' <PERSON> Walraven </PERSON> said.

 The first game in the world chess championship candidates' quarterfinal between <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Spraggett </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Artur </PERSON> <PERSON> Yusipov </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> ended in a 37-move draw on Saturday. <PERSON> Spraggett </PERSON>, 34, from <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, is considered the underdog by most experts in this six-game contest with <PERSON> Yusipov </PERSON>, a 29-year-old, who plays board-three for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> behind world champion <PERSON> Garri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> and the former world titleholder <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>. `` Spraggett's not the favorite, but he's not to be underrated,'' said <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopec </PERSON>, an American international master. `` He proves that again and again.'' By holding the draw, with the black pieces, <PERSON> Spraggett </PERSON> now gains a small edge because he has three remaining games to play with the advantage of the white pieces while <PERSON> Yusipov </PERSON> has only two. The second game of the contest scheduled to finish Jan. 29 will be played Sunday, with <PERSON> Spraggett </PERSON> playing white. A win scores a point and a draw a half point. <PERSON> Yusipov </PERSON> gained a nagging edge from a queen's gambit, but the Canadian managed to free his cramped position with a pawn break on the 23rd move. With both players short of time, <PERSON> Yusipov </PERSON> forced a draw by repeating the position. The winner of the contest will receive five-eighths of the $ 32,000 prize fund with the loser receiving three-eighths. British grand master <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON> is so far the only player qualified for the semifinal, which is scheduled to be played in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in October. The contest between former world champion <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johann </PERSON> <PERSON> Hjartarson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> will begin Jan. 28 in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. The remaining duel pits Dutch grandmaster <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Timman </PERSON> with <PERSON> Lajos </PERSON> <PERSON> Portisch </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, which starts in the Belgian city of <LOCATION> Antwerp </LOCATION> on Jan. 31. The winner of the candidates' cycle will challenge <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> for his title in autumn 1990. <PERSON> Spraggett </PERSON> shot to prominence in his previous qualifier with Soviet grandmaster <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokolov </PERSON>. Although <PERSON> Sokolov </PERSON> was expected to crush the Canadian, <PERSON> Spraggett </PERSON> held on to tie 3-3 and defeated his opponent in a hair-raising playoff at high speed.

<HEAD>Uranium Plant Work Continues Despite Shutdown Recommendation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Construction projects worth more than $ 80 million are in progress at the federal government's uranium-processing plant in nearby <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION> despite recommendations that the facility be closed by 1994 About 500 of the plant's 1,264 employees have finished two-thirds of a six-year schedule of projects to replace old equipment and improve safeguards at the 39-year-old plant. In contrast, only 123 of the workers were involved in cleanup of radioactive contamination at the facility, which processes uranium the government refines elsewhere for use in nuclear weapons. The construction work is defended by the plant owner, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> and the plant operator, <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Materials </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Both claim the projects will improve environmental safety and production at the site 18 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. `` There is no construction that I am aware of that would fall under the category of expanding production capability,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. `` There are a number of improvements and construction projects that, while related to production, are environmental or safety-related.'' The Energy Department scheduled $ 88 million worth of construction at <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION> from 1985 to 1991. About $ 7 million worth of projects that would have increased production capacity have been canceled because demand for uranium at the plant has fallen sharply as other government reactors have closed. A report by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, known as the `` 2010 Report,'' recommended closing the plant by 1994. Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> concurred with the report and passed it along to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The recommendation, however, has no legal force. `` We're supposed to maintain the feasibility of production until we're phased out,'' <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> spokesman told The <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enquirer </ORGANIZATION> in a story published Saturday. Neighbors of the facility have sued the plant's former operator, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION>, alleging it allowed unsafe amounts of chemical and radioactive pollution into the atmosphere, putting their health at risk and depleting the value of their property. The Energy Department has acknowledged the pollution in documents filed in the suit pending in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. Critics question using money for construction on a plant the government wants to close. `` It's typical. ... Money that obviously should be used for cleanup is being frittered away on projects they admit will not be needed,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Government Accountability Project, a Washington-based lobbying group. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, a spokesman for Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said it makes no sense `` to pour money into revitalizing the facility when there are problems that will just fester and get worse.'' But <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Boswell </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION>, the plant's president, said the facility must be maintained in good condition because its capacity may still be needed. `` Although the 2010 report says we'll operate just until 1994, that does n't mean everything here will be demolished then,'' <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said. `` And we do have production quotas for the next few years.''

 A satellite that provides those clever moving cloud pictures for television weather forecasts failed Saturday, depriving customers of views of the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, officials said. The failure occurred aboard GOES-6, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> satellite that was launched in April 1983, said <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Mortman </PERSON>, a shift supervisor at the agency's satellite operations control center `` It's just old age,'' <PERSON> Mortman </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> meteorologist <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said weather map-making would be little affected. `` For making maps it would n't have that much effect,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said, noting that forecasters rely mostly on conventional ground data. `` We do things such as help them locate frontal positions ... coming in over the ocean areas. It's sort of extra input,'' he said of the GOES-6 data. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said partial pictures can be provided from a companion satellite, GOES-7, that covers the <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We'll be getting pictures from the eastern satellite. Eventually we will move the eastern satellite over so it can cover the entire country,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mortman </PERSON> said the process of moving GOES-7, using small rockets mounted to the satellite, would be completed around Feb. 21. Controllers will move the GOES-7 satellite from its present position at 80 degrees west longitude over northern <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to 108 degrees west longitude. GOES-6 is located at 134.5 west longitude, far out over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. The two satellites are in stationary orbits 22,300 miles above the equator. Until the satellite is moved, weather-watching also will be augmented by other existing satellites operated by <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> and by satellites from the European and Japanese space agencies, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyke </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant administrator for satellite and information services. <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> said GOES-7 will perform double duty for an estimated 18 months until mid-1990, when the next GOES satellite is expected to be ready for launch. <PERSON> Mortman </PERSON> said the satellites take cloud-cover pictures in narrow strips and then compile the pieces to give large-scale, moving views of cloud patterns. An encoder lamp that is critical to the compilation process failed, he said. `` Without the lamp you have no instrument,'' <PERSON> Mortman </PERSON> said.

 A private firecracker factory blew up in southern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Henan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> province </LOCATION>, killing 26 people and seriously injuring 18, the state-run radio reported Sunday. The blast of 15 tons of explosives, which occurred Friday, gutted the factory located in a private house in <LOCATION> Chenguang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION>, the radio said. Five people were killed immediately and 21 died later in the hospital, the report said. Safety standards are generally low in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s more than 90,000 small-scale private and township-run fireworks factories, and accidents are common. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has begun drafting workplace safety regulations but enforcement is lax. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s biggest holiday, Spring Festival, the celebration of the lunar new year, occurs in early February. Fireworks and firecrackers are used in the celebrations. Several cities have taken measures to restrict the use of fireworks. <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> has banned fireworks from the city's center during the holiday, which begins Feb. 6. A recent report in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>'s Xinmin Evening News said railway officials were overwhelmed with cases of people trying to smuggle fireworks onto trains. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> police also are cracking down. The Chinese are believed to have invented gunpowder, the main ingredient in fireworks, in the 9th century.

 Former <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klan </PERSON> leader <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> led a field of seven candidates Saturday to advance to a runoff election for a <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat representing a mostly white suburban district. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, 38, former imperial wizard of the Knights of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>, had 3,995 votes, or 33 percent. He ran as a Republican, but under <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s open primary system all candidates run on the same ballot, regardless of party. `` The Klan is far behind me, but the effort for equal rights for everybody is ahead of me,'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Saturday night. `` I think when I win this race you'll find candidates across the state and across the country begin to talk about the issues I'm raising,'' said <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, whose campaign platform included such racial issues as welfare reform to reduce black births `` I think this is the beginning of a change in this country.'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> will meet fellow Republican <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> in the Feb. 18 runoff. <PERSON> Treen </PERSON>, 62, brother of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s first Republican governor since Reconstruction, came in second with 2,277 votes, or 19 percent. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> served four years as governor, beginning in 1980. In <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, the top two vote-getters go into a runoff election if no one wins a majority. <PERSON> Delton </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, a Republican member of the <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, was a close third with 2,011 votes, or 17 percent. <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> both drew endorsements from high-profile politicians. Four other candidates split the remainder of the vote. They were Democrat <PERSON> Budd </PERSON> <PERSON> Olister </PERSON>, 1,150, or 10 percent; Republican <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Villere </PERSON>, 1,142, or 9 percent; Republican <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Courtade </PERSON>, 791, or 7 percent; and Democrat <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Savoie </PERSON>, 697, or 6 percent.

 The special election was to fill a seat vacated by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Cusimano </PERSON>, who became a state judge. The district covers a predominantly white neighborhood in <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION>, a suburb of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> left the Klan in 1980 after being accused of trying to sell top-secret membership lists and set up the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of White People. He calls himself a white civil rights worker. But his Klan activities emerged as an issue during the state House race with a report that he has a personal listing under the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> in the telephone directory. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said the listing was only to make it easier for people to contact him, and offered to sign an affidavit swearing he is no longer a Klan member. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> mounted a campaign for president last year as a Democrat.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> put a hard-rocking finish to the weekend of inaugural parties Saturday night at a rollicking bash where new Republican party chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> jammed with a stage full of rock' n' roll legends, including <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Cocker </PERSON>. The new president, after giving a double thumbs-up when the star-studded performance of `` High Heeled Sneakers'' came to an end, mounted the stage himself and was presented with a gleaming white guitar carrying the legend `` The Prez.'' The 64-year-old <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> got right into the rhythm of things, trying to follow <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s fingerwork on `` Soul Man,'' but it was all for show: the gift guitar was n't plugged in. At one point, the 37-year-old <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, an unreconstructed rhythm and blues fan from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, dropped to his knees, then fell back to the floor, all the while strumming his guitar. `` I taught <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> everything he knows about that kind of dancing,'' joked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who the night before was pained to take even a few waltz steps with the first lady. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and several of their children were also at Saturday's concert, clapping and cheering throughout. `` Listen, I want to get this show -LRB- to -RRB- keep going. That was marvelous, absolutely wonderful,'' said the president. `` I know when to shut up and I know when to say something. This is a time to shut up.'' The big band on stage included <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cropper </PERSON> and others from the <ORGANIZATION> Blues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> once played with the Rolling Stones. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> was famous as part of the soul duo, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dave </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 32-year-old son, <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON>, helped organize the rock affair. Earlier, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> showed off his Lone Star boots to an appreciative crowd at a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> `` black tie and boots'' affair for thousands of members of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hilton </LOCATION>. His footgear was black with a map of the state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> enameled on each of them, and with a Lone Star flag in the middle. `` I want to show you my boots. I do n't want <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> to think I'm not a Texan,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, referring to the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> state treasurer who delivered an address mocking <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the Democratic National Convention last July. She did not appear to be at the party. Coyly lifting his pants leg, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Hey, listen. Stop whistling at me.'' Several people yelled `` take em' off.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who did not address the crowds at any of the numerous balls she and her husband visited the night before, said, `` What I ought to do is make <PERSON> George </PERSON> stand on his head and really show you those boots.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in what was clearly the understatement of the evening, told the 9,000 young people jammed into the Convention Center: `` This has got to have been the most active event of the inauguration. It is fantastic.'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> presented the guitar to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. After trying his hand at `` Soul Man,'' he gave up and waved <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> off. `` Ladies and gentlemen, this is a dream come true. ... You're going to hear the greatest of rhythm and blues and soul,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> told the crowd before some of the best-known singers in the genre took the convention center stage `` Tonight is not the night for politics. ... We're going to have the time of our lives tonight,'' said the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, native who likes to entertain friends with his own guitar playing. Among those who led off the show were <PERSON> Percy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sledge </PERSON> singing his classic `` When a Man Loves a Woman,'' and <PERSON> Coco </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, the so-called queen of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> blues. Audience members, who paid $ 35 a seat, were mostly young, wearing a range of outfits from black tie to blue jeans and casual clothes. Behind the stage in the center of the hall party-goers packed the dance floor to twist and jitterbug to the sounds of the 1950s and 1960s. In front of the stage, VIP guests sipped soft drinks at round tables. Among those attending were <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBlond </PERSON>, two of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s children. Earlier, at the black tie and boots event, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told his audience and a separate overflow crowd, `` We've had a great, wonderful family day.'' He recalled going home to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Friday night for the first time, looking out the window and seeing people already lined up to visit it during Saturday's open house. `` Here were people who spent all night out there under blankets _ or maybe not,'' he said. `` It made me realize just how important it is to be the custodian of the people's house.'' And Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who wore a red dress with a black, lace-covered bodice, also turned serious, saying, `` Just a minute ago, when <PERSON> George </PERSON> said ` first lady' _ I do n't think so. I think I'm still <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s wife and I'm darn happy to be living in the White House.''

 A tough Iranian crackdown on drug traffickers takes effect today, with a mandatory death penalty for anyone found with small amounts of narcotics. At least 75 smugglers already have been executed this month in the fiercest crackdown since the early days of the Islamic revolution, when hundreds of alleged drug users and pushers were rounded up and killed. The new campaign followed the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war and an alarming surge in drug abuse blamed on hardships caused by the 8-year conflict, worsening unemployment and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s religious ban on alcohol. The laws mandate death for people convicted of possessing 30 grams, or just over an ounce, of heroin, codeine or morphine or smuggling 11 pounds of opium or hashish. Simple possession of opium or hashish carries a jail term.

<TEXT>
 By all the evidence, Wall Street is expecting good things as <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> begins his presidency. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was preparing to take the oath of office last week, the stock market climbed to new highs since the crash of 1987. Analysts said that was n't just a coincidence. `` Stock and bond prices rallied despite tight money and a growing risk of recession,'' said <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinemann </PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION> Ladenburg </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thalmann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` In part, this was a vote of confidence in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brigade. Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has deep roots in the financial community. Perhaps he will bring the bull back to lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>.'' During the presidential campaign and in the period after the election, investors seemed to change their appraisal of the former vice president sevberal times. Once the conventions were over and the race came down to two candidates, the markets registered their decided preference for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> over Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. But by the time the election results were in on Nov. 8, market participants seemed to develop some misgivings. Over the next six trading sessions, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average fell 88.89 points. That selloff was n't necessarily the result of second thoughts about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s prospects, many analysts argued. But it did appear to signal doubts about what any president would be able to do to shrink the federal budget deficit without inducing a recession. Since then, traders evidently have grown more optimistic that constructive action will be taken. `` We think the financial markets care almost as much about the politics of the budget this year as they do about the deficit,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The market's worst fear is that we might have to face a protracted stalemate with a president who wo n't deal. `` We think the poker game will be different after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and has more Congressional ties than <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ever had, and he has said he will meet with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to work out a budget.'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, Washington-watcher at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, says investors may see some surprises as the tax and budget negotiations between the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> unfold. `` If <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could get <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to accept a half dozen budget packages containing tax increases, why should n't it expect the same result with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>?'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> says. But he adds, `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wo n't relent. In my opinion, he will prove to be a stronger opponent of tax increases that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ever was.'' The new president, he notes, `` has spent much of his career in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He knows how to play the game. `` I do not expect <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to bamboozle him into a tax increase, although maybe around October he might go along with some modest sin-tax increases if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> offers up enough spending to go along.'' Political commentators have remarked that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has won for himself much more of a `` honeymoon'' than anyone thought he would get, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and on Wall Street as well. As <PERSON> Heinemann </PERSON> put it: `` The new administration has made it plain it will confront, not avoid, a host of long-festering issues. `` The federal budget, the savings and loan crisis, drug enforcement, toxic waste, Third World debt _ the list goes on and on _ will all get fresh, pragmatic examinations from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brigade in months to come. Actions should replace stalemate.''

<HEAD>Tensions Among Disaffected Blacks Had Been Rising</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Super Bowl week began with <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s civic leaders and promoters eager to show off the vibrant city's new look _ and with most of the black community on the sidelines, as usual. The black problems of disaffection, displacement, despair, resentment, feelings of injustice and lack of hope were there seething, but far from the national spotlight or from immediate local concern. Then the confusing fatal police shooting of a black motorcyclist on the Monday night of Martin Luther King Day, provided the spark that quickly brought smouldering tensions to a fiery rage of violent disturbances lasting three days. Now black leaders, offended by the initial local focusing on the riot's damage to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s Super Bowl image instead of the reasons behind it, say the question to them had n't been `` Why?'' blacks erupted again, as they did in 1980 riots and disturbances in 1982 and 1984. It was `` When?'' `` Here we are once again,'' said <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, who has served on the <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> since the 1980 rioting aftermath. `` The black community takes all these negatives and they store them and you've got the powder keg. It's just a question of who would detonate it.'' `` It is almost elementary now,'' said a weary-sounding <PERSON> Garth </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, publisher of the black-oriented <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. `` We keep hoping we learn from the past; hopefully, we're coming around to redressing our grievances.'' Much has changed about <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> since it last was host to a Super Bowl 10 years earlier. There is a colorful new downtown skyline, a modern people-mover system, a <LOCATION> Bayside </LOCATION> marketplace of shops and restaurants, a new downtown convention center and three new luxury hotels; a new $ 50 million basketball arena. And the football game itself will be played in a new stadium north of the city. A `` Cubanization'' of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> has transformed it from a southern, tourism-based resort to a thriving center of Latin commerce, as refugees from <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s revolution stopped being exiles and exerted financial, social and political influence. The transformation, though, swept past blacks, who account for between 20 percent and 25 percent of the county's nearly 1.8 million residents. Hispanics _ chiefly Cubans _ account for about 40 percent. Blacks saw their neighborhoods carved up for new buildings and roads and felt themselves slipping in the city's new tri-ethnic structure: from perhaps second to the whites who had run <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, to third. `` It's like standing on shore and looking at a body of water, watching the high tide constantly receding from you over a period of 10 years,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Teele </PERSON>, a black attorney. `` What you have in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> today is a community that has grown dynamically in a way perhaps no other city has ever grown, and in a short time. And what you have had is a squeezing out of the black community; socially, economically, politically.'' A listing in The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> last year of the city's power brokers was filled with Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites -LRB- called Anglos here -RRB-. City listings of ethnic ownership of businesses have put black ownership in single-digit percentages. Black unemployment in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in 1987 was 10.4 percent, nearly double that of the two other ethnic groups. Black youth unemployment in neighborhoods such as <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> was estimated at 40 percent to 50 percent. Jobs have n't been coming in to the black community, but crack cocaine has, and that has compounded crime. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>' agency compiles a weekly neighborhood `` tension chart,'' using reports from its own staff and some 150 volunteers, ranging from county judges to bus drivers, who are in daily contact with the black comunity. Using reports on police incidents, crime and what people are talking about, plus their own experience and sense of the community, the <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> staffers assign black neighborhoods numbers from 1 to 5 and watch for areas that stay near the crisis level of 5. `` The levels were staying high,'' <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said. `` That's an indication of something seriously wrong.'' <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> last month became alarmed by a startling series of similarities to community concerns in 1980 before the riots that killed 18 and did hundreds of millions of dollars worth of damage. In late December, he said, his staff wrote to the chiefs of the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> police department and listed comparisons. For example, in 1980, several black officials were under fire, most notably <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> Superintendent <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> who lost his job in March 1980 after being charged with grand theft for alleged misuse of school funds. A later conviction was overturned on appeal, but <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> eventually served time for solicitation of perjury. In 1988, several black officials were under fire, including <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, who was acquitted in a 1983 bribery trial but has been impeached by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. As in 1980, when the <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was recovering from the indictments and trial of former officers accused of helping a cocaine kingpin, 1988 saw <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> police struggling after the indictments and trials of officers accused of running a drug ripoff ring. In both years, <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said, there were several instances of controversial police shootings of black suspects and wrong-house raids; one before the 1980 riots involved a former black schoolteacher, while one this year involved a black minister. Deep-seated economic and social problems were combining with feelings that black officials were being singled out for persecution, that police could n't be trusted and that they were unfairly violent to blacks, <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said as he reviewed the <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> letter dated Dec. 23. After that letter, a federal judge in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> ruled that <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> immigrants could n't be forced to stay near the border while awaiting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> action on their asylum requests. That led this month to a `` buslift'' of hundreds of Central Americans, most Nicaraguans, to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The Cuban community, identifying with Latin refugees fleeing a Marxist homeland, opened up their pocketbooks with donations to help the Nicaraguans amid predictions the 100,000-strong Nicaraguan exile community could double by year's end. To some blacks, who had seen more than 100,000 Cubans come into <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> in less than five months in the 1980 <LOCATION> Mariel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boatlift </LOCATION> that began a month before the race riots, this was another group coming to crowd them further down the city ladder. Some compared the open-arms treatment for Nicaraguans to the fact that many black Haitian immigrants are turned away before they reach the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> coast or are later deported.

 The incident that touched off last week's rioting also bore striking similarities to events of the past. In 1980, the acquittal of <LOCATION> Metro-Dade </LOCATION> police officers charged in the beating death of black motorcyclist <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> McDuffie </PERSON> sparked riots. In 1982 there were disturbances after the fatal shooting of a black youth by a Cuban-born <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> police officer, and in 1984 after that officer's acquittal. When it came, many blacks scoffed at civic clucking over the unfortunate timing of their rage. `` These people and their lives were here before the Super Bowl,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's wrong to worry about the incident might hurt the Super Bowl, or will the Heat -LRB- basketball team -RRB- play tonight? What about the people in the Heat neighborhood -LRB- <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> -RRB-?'' As in the past, city leaders responded with promises of speedy, impartial investigation of the triggering incident and help for the underlying problems. Some black community leaders say the new efforts will face skepticism from most blacks. Cuban-born Mayor <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> has made improving black neighborhoods a top priority since taking office three years ago, and his predecessor, Puerto Rico-born <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON>, had made that a theme in the last years of his 12-year tenure. Reviewing <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s progress in 1985, <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON> said: `` We must also be on the cutting edge of solving problems of the poor who live in our ghettos. Recent years have found increased local-government aid and loans to spur black enterprise, job placement services aimed at blacks, requirements that 25 percent of local-government contracts go to blacks, and appointments of two successive black <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> city police chiefs. `` But the problems are so overwhelming, that if we had kept all our promises, it would have made no difference,'' <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON> said last week. High-level leadership must be backed by support for blacks by the community as a whole, he and others said. `` It does n't do any good to start pointing fingers,'' said <PERSON> Teele </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration mass transportation official and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War hero. `` All of us must shoulder some responsibility.'' Can the fire next time be avoided? `` That's the $ 64,000 question, ... I'm not in a position to predict,'' <PERSON> Teele </PERSON> said. `` Not if there's not a comprehensive commitment to respond to these repeated cries for help.''

<HEAD>Market Sometimes Cool to New Presidents</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If the stock market is going to do well in the first year of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidency, it will have to give him a warmer welcome than it has accorded the past several newcomers to the White House. In 1969, when President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> took office, the market dropped about 14 percent. After his successor, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, was sworn in in August 1974, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average went into a 200-point swoon in less than two months. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, in 1977, was greeted with a 10 percent decline. Even the arrival of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, with his immense popularity on Wall Street, was followed by a 7 percent loss in 1981. It is a generally accepted view in the financial world that this tendency is more than coincidence. A change of command presumably begets uncertainty among investors, who pull back until they become familiar with a new administration. Furthermore, new presidents often use their early months in office to take tough measures that would be politically difficult or awkward at any other time. And, as it happens, 1969, 1974 and 1981 _ though not 1977 _ were recession years. As 1989 begins, the economy is growing, with few signs of a business slump any time soon. Stock prices have rallied in the weeks leading up to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inauguration, aided by hopes that he would bring a new touch to dealing with some old problems. Nevertheless, Wall Streeters are watching closely to see if past patterns repeat themselves. Said <PERSON> Suresh </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhirud </PERSON>, chief investment strategist at <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, `` 1989 is likely to be a very difficult year for stocks and bonds. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> budget deficit is no longer improving. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has become a net debtor, currently owing $ 400 billion to the rest of the world. `` Capacity utilization is very tight in the manufacturing sector, and labor shortages are beginning to surface. And there is too much debt in all sectors of the economy.'' Stocks shrugged off such worries in the past week. In fact, the week's best showing came on Wednesday, in the face of a government report that showed a larger-than-expected increase in the nation's trade deficit The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed Friday at 2,235.36, up 9.29 from the week before. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index rose 1.58 to 161.16; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market gained 4.53 to 391.62, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index was up 3.59 at 319.52. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 161.40 million shares a day, up from 153.57 million the week before. There has been much talk on Wall Street of late that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may well prove more adroit than most chief executives at working with a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> dominated by the opposing party. In particular, hopes seem to have increased that a constructive plan for dealing with the budget deficit can be worked out. `` The prevailing level of optimism about good things happening in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> provides a good chance for disappointment, in my view,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` We must keep in mind that the pace of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> does n't match Wall Street's. The certified optimists in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> feel investors could see action on the budget deficit by April or May at the earliest. `` That is still a long time away for Wall Streeters. `` The stock market does not usually react well to newly elected presidents,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> concluded. But the past record suggests, he added, that `` after the president has about six months to settle in, the market usually likes what it is seeing.''

 Many investment strategists scrounged to devise logical explanations for the curiously cheerful behavior of the stock, bond and dollar markets in the face of disturbing news about the trade deficit. Only a few considered the emotional, but just as potent, power of a presidential inauguration to incite euphoria about the future, whether justified or not. Perhaps the most confounding event of the past week was the market reaction to the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> news that the trade deficit, the most visible symbol of declining <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic might, surged to $ 12.51 billion in November, reflecting a 2.3 percent drop in exports and 4.2 percent rise in imports. The report suggested the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was losing the battle to export more and import less, a struggle to avoid what some economists see as a looming financial crisis based on <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s habit of spending beyond its means It was the sort of news that in months past would have incited a heavy selloff in the dollar and sent investors fleeing from securities denominated in the currency, namely stocks and bonds. News of a ballooning trade deficit was one of the elements that played a role in the October 1987 stock market crash. Instead, the dollar surged in hectic trading despite efforts by the world's central banks to stem the rise by selling dollars on the open market. Elsewhere, the stock market rallied to a post-crash high, interest rates eased and bond prices strengthened. What happened? Many strategists scrambling for answers now reasoned that the dollar had been undervalued in the first place. Some said more important economic signs, such as strong corporate profits, low inflation and a decline in borrowing, had overshadowed the market neurosis over the trade deficit. Others maintained the overall trade deficit was shrinking in relation to the country's total economic output. A few even heralded what they saw as the reincarnation of the historic bull market on Wall Street. Dollar traders theorized the trade deficit news meant the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would tighten interest rates, a signal that they should buy dollars. But securities traders theorized that the economy was slowing and the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would n't have to tighten interest rates, so they bought stocks and bonds. Suddenly, almost everybody was finding good news in the week that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would become the 41st president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, only a few months after the markets worried about his inflexible ban on new taxes, indicating an uncertain commitment to reducing the trade and budget deficits. In the chorus of enthusiasm that historically accompanies a presidential inauguration, only a few economists raised skeptical hands. `` What's happening in the financial markets is that everybody is pretending the deficits are n't that important,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. International `` Nobody's paying any attention to the fundamentals because the attention has diverted to politics. In other major business and economic news this past week: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the rate of increase in consumer prices last year totaled 4.4 percent, matching the 1987 gain But private economists said mild increases in energy costs last year masked more serious inflation. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said housing construction dropped 8.2 percent in 1988 to its lowest level in six years But industry analysts said the housing industry, one of the most sensitive to economic slowdowns, remained healthy. _ <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s freewheeling commodity exchanges acknowedged a major federal sting operation to investigate possible widespread fraud <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents posing as brokers secretly taped conversations on trading floors and reportedly implicated more than 100 people. _ <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> agreed to sell its 78 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> for $ 3.24 billion, a key part of the No 3 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil company's post-bankrutpcy restructuring.

<HEAD>Why Don't We Have Serious Inflation?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 These are difficult times for those whose reputations are based on forecasts of inflation. Some have been at it for more than two years now, and month after month they wait in vain for fulfillment. Again in December the official consumer price report failed them. December prices rose just 0.3 percent, the same as in November. And inflation for all 1988 was 4.4 percent, no higher than a year earlier. Inflation of that rate is n't to be ignored, of course. If continued, it would cut buying power in half in about 16 years. Apply that to housing prices or education and you can see how it might submerge many families. But, while undesirable, 4.4 percent inflation is tolerable for a short period, and in fact, history shows that it is almost impossible to avoid from time to time. It is not runaway inflation, which some seers have forecast. Still suffering from the trauma of the 1970s, when inflation trampled the economies of millions of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> households, a very large segment of the forecasting fraternity nevertheless has made it their over-riding concern. For them, it is a passion. They stand high in the watchtower, binoculars raised, peering over the distance, seeking evidence they know must be out there. Each day they scan the horizon for ominous shapes. In recent weeks they have discovered new possibilities taking shape. Energy prices, for example, are likely to rise because of higher world prices. The 1988 drought has pushed up food costs. And prices for services, especially health care, are rising faster than product prices. Moreover, industrial activity appears to be getting close to capacity at the very time the jobless rates has been pushed down to a 14-year low. Either one could set the inflation spiral spinning faster. The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Economic Advisors described the threat succinctly: `` When an economy is in a ` full-employment zone,' continuing price inflation eventually spills into wage costs which, through downward pressure on profits, spill back into prices which, in turn spill back into wages. While worrisome, however, such items and others do not necessarily make a case for an important rise in prices generally in 1989. Over the past few years similar scares have evaporated, sometimes magically. True, luck was involved. Last year, to illustrate, oil prices fell during the year, offsetting food price increases. The falling jobless rate did not produce wage inflation, as widely expected. Neither did the rise in plant and equipment usage. Many economists had stated confidently their belief that if industrial activity reached 83 percent of capacity inflation would certainly boil over. Now they have been forced to raise the critical percentage. The exact level is still unknown, but one thing is clear: It is not what it used to be. Several explanations have been offered for the economy having the good fortune to avoid the worst fears of the pessimists: Greater competition in a global economy; wage restraint by labor; more efficient production facilities placed on stream in the past decade or so; wiser corporate management; <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> restraint. Monetary restraint, which grew tighter throughout 1988, has produced an economy that plods rather than races, and that slow rate of expansion is perhaps the best defense of all against a surge of inflation. Meanwhile, the pessimists are saying that events are not unfolding logically, and that we should be getting more inflation _ if not today then certainly tomorrow. For many of them, destructive inflation is a presence in its absence. They talk about it, write about it, warn about it and confidently forecast that it will come. Maybe it will, and then they'll be right, finally.

<HEAD>Turf Battle Smolders As Banks Tred Further Into Wall Street Territory</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 By giving banks the right to operate in an area off limits for more than 50 years, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> signaled willingness to let banking companies and investment houses meet in head-on competition. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s unanimous decision this past week authorizing five large banks to underwrite corporate debt addressed one of the key elements of rules designed to reduce risks identified as a cause of bank failures during the Depression. Limits set by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will prevent banks from challenging the dominance of big Wall Street securities firms in the near future. However, the decision eventually will lead to increased competition and pinch the profitablity of debt underwriting, analysts say. Historical banking functions were separated from securities businesses by the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, but in modern times the line between the two has blurred as banks have been permitted to broaden their activities and investment houses have created bank-like services, such as money-market accounts that work like checking accounts. The ensuing turf battle has featured brokerages complaining about banks encroaching on their territory while the banks argue that times have changed and they should be free to participate in the worldwide trend toward `` universal'' banking, which has led to the creation of financial conglomerates offering a wide range of services. Even though the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s move greatly expands the type of underwriting banks may do, it places low limits on the quantity of underwriting. Also, responding to concerns about concentrating too much power among banks, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> spelled out how banks engaging in underwriting must structure their operations. Generally, the parent bank must refrain from involving itself too closely in operations of securities affiliates. Debt underwriting is a crucial link in the process of raising money for businesses. Corporations selling bonds depend on underwriters to purchase them and then resell them to the public. For acting as a marketer in this way, underwriters collect fees that in recent years have been shrinking as other financing methods have gained more widespread use. Last year, the value of new corporate debt registered with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and sold to the public totaled about $ 100 billion, industry estimates show. On deals lately, an underwriter can expect to make about $ 7.50 per $ 1,000 of face value of a long-term bond issue. So, of a $ 100 million bond issue, the underwriter's share would be $ 750,000, minus expenses, typically netting the underwriter $ 500,000. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Judge </PERSON>, a vice president in the bond trading department of <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. International, said that as a result of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s decision, underwriters might have to settle for smaller spreads as more competitors vie for a share of the business The five banks given debt underwriting authorization also had asked the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> for permission to sell new issues of stock, but the central bank withheld that power for a year, pending a review of the banks' activities. The five banks are: <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kriz </PERSON>, senior analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said banks will not make much of a dent in the debt underwriting business of the giants that handle most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deals `` In the long term, it signifies a trend toward universal banking, which is what we already have in most European financial centers,'' he said, adding that in the future it will `` put severe pressure on profits.'' From the view of big money-center banks, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s latest move was significant only so far as it was part of the evolution of the industry's financial powers. It enables them to provide a service in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that some already have experience with in the Eurobond market. Judging by the somewhat unimpressive record of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks in underwriting debt overseas, one banking analyst who asked that his name not be used said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s decision `` wo n't amount to a hill of beans.''

 They find things in the dark. They check groceries, play concertos and perform eye surgery. They are faster than a speeding bullet and could do serious damage to a locomotive. Lasers have been the Superman of the electromagnetic spectrum ever since 1960, when 33-year-old <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maiman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> built the first one from a pink ruby. As they near their 30th anniversary, though, lasers have switched from comic-book novelties to necessities that preoccupy the technology giants of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Lasers are not only in compact disc players and bar-code scanners at checkout counters, they are in the phone system, carrying long-distance calls over hair-thin glass fibers. Now, lasers are poised to take a quantum leap. Tiny devices called quantum lasers herald an era in which lasers will be more central to the technology underlying daily life. Experts say quantum lasers and their cousins, quantum transistors, could make possible supercomputers the size of baseballs, and television screens of unparalleled clarity that hang on the wall like a painting. `` Quantum devices are the wave of the future. Almost all of the research that goes on involves quantum effects in some way or another,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>, director of the solid state electronics research lab at <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labs </ORGANIZATION>. Lasers are what some scientists call a `` killer'' technology: Compact discs are killing vinyl records, for example, and nobody uses copper anymore for long-distance phone lines. To repeat a familiar story, the Japanese are putting the American-invented killer to use more effectively than Americans themselves are. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s dominance of mass-market electronics gives its companies unmatched expertise in making things small, cheap and reliable. For example, Japanese companies dominate the market for CD players, which use more lasers than any other product. `` It's a byproduct of the Japanese decision to invest in consumer electronics. They'll find an application and find the technology to solve it. I wish we did it here,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kressel </PERSON>, a venture capitalist at <ORGANIZATION> E.M. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pincus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Inc. in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s twin towers of strength in lasers and semiconductors could allow it to build the first computers in which chips are connected by quantum laser beams instead of electricity. That worries companies like <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which is intensively studying quantum well lasers and quantum well transistors. At <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s foremost laser research centers, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> is hoping to leapfrog the Japanese. But he admits the competition is tough: For an early model of his `` optical computer'' he had to use a diode laser he took from a Japanese-made CD player. A laser is a directed needle of light purified to one particular color, or wavelength. In contrast, ordinary light is a jumble of many wavelengths flying in all directions. `` Laser'' stands for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. In a cascading effect, photons of light strike an energized material and stimulate the release of more photons in a synchronized pattern. The most powerful lasers, big enough for someone to walk inside, are being used to attempt to fuse the nuclei of atoms in flashes of energy a million times more intense than a nuclear blast. Sustained nuclear fusion could be a source of clean, plentiful and cheap electricity. At the other end of the scale are semiconductor diode lasers, no bigger than a grain of salt _ the kind used in compact disc players and the phone system. One exotic subspecies is the quantum laser. Scientists build quantum lasers by `` spray-painting'' atoms in a layer cake of incredibly thin layers, some of which have impurities added. The impure layers act like walls to trap electrons. Confining so many electrons and their receptors -LRB- `` holes'' -RRB- to a tiny space makes it easier to get a cascade of photons going, creating laser light. If a laser the size of a salt crystal were blown up to the size of the World Trade Center in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a quantum well would be about the thickness of a rug in an office, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ettenberg </PERSON>, director of the optoelectronics research lab at the <ORGANIZATION> David </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sarnoff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> Quantum lasers are more precise and require less current, and their efficiency in converting electricity to light is unmatched. Spectra Diode Laboratories of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, recently produced 55 watts of continuous wave power from a quantum laser, a record power output and power conversion efficiency for a semiconductor laser, president and chief executive <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Scifres </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> this past week. Ophthalmic surgeons have used lasers since 1970 to weld detached retinas. Later came other medical uses like excising tumors and eliminating cataracts. Today, lasers snaked into the body on optical fibers clean arteries and destroy urinary-tract stones. Lasers are used to make pinholes in the nipples of baby bottles, study components of car exhaust and form the three-dimensional holograms used on credit cards _ and maybe someday dollar bills. The military has `` Star Wars'' designs for free-electron lasers and powerful X-ray lasers, which physicist <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Teller </PERSON> has suggested could be triggered by a nuclear blast. Laser weapons would most likely be mounted in space: `` People tried to shoot laser beams through the sky and what they discovered was fog and rain,'' said <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bridges </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. Quantum well lasers fill only one niche, but an important one. Their speed and efficiency makes them ideal for rapid-fire communication, initially for long-distance calls, later for links between neighboring computers and eventually for the links between chips in computers, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Melcher </PERSON>, a laser expert for <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. `` I've been in the laser game for 25 years now,'' said one researcher, <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` That -LRB- quantum lasers -RRB- is where the future lies.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s sale of its lucrative Canadian subsidiary marked one of the final steps in a massive restructuring since the oil giant emerged from bankruptcy law protection last April. But while observers say they are impressed with the pace and execution of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s restructuring, they concede the oil giant's future remains uncertain <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> has made major changes over the last year, selling off major assets, reorganizing internally and shifting its focus to exploration and production from refining and marketing. But despite the changes, analysts say <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> has not been able to formulate a clear, long-term strategy due largely to the cost and energy that has gone into battling the power plays of a legion of dissatisfied investors led by its largest shareholder, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has been pushing <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> to boost the value of the company's stock by selling off assets and this week indicated he might try for a second time to wrest control of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s board from management at the May shareholders meeting <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> also has indicated in the past he might mount a buyout bid for the oil giant. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's third-largest oil company behind <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, announced Friday it had signed a definitive agreement to sell its 78 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> for $ 34.36 a share, or $ 3.24 billion. The deal was the final step in the asset-sale portion asset sale portion of a major restructuring. The Canadian subsidiary fetched far more than had been anticipated, bringing the total value of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s asset sales under its restructuring program to more than $ 7 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> has promised to distribute $ 1.7 billion in proceeds from the sales to shareholders, probably in the form of a stock buyback. Analysts say they do n't expect <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> to boost the amount of the proceeds promised to shareholders, but rather raise the common dividend to enhance shareholder value over the longer term. Nevertheless, now could be the perfect opportunity to weaken shareholder support for <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, especially if <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> opts for a stock buyback, some analysts say. `` I believe <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s intention all along has been to sell, not to buy,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Friday's sale included <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION>'s refining assets but left intact much of its exploration and production assets in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> as well as in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and other areas <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Maneri </PERSON> acknowledged that the company's focus has shifted to exploration and production side of the business `` That's clearly where <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> is going,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. `` But the jury is still out as to whether <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> will have success in the exploration business.'' In the last two years, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil production has declined by approximately 1 million barrels a day due in mainly to a sharp drop in oil prices, according to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. During that time, many major oil companies have shifted their focus to the more profitable refining and marketing side of the industry. Analysts say <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s turn to exploration and production has happened by default due to its financial troubles. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws in April 1987 to avoid having to post a potentially ruinous multibillion-dollar security bond in its fight with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> had sued claiming <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s 1984 acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> interfered with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>'s prior contract to buy part of the reserve-rich <PERSON> Getty </PERSON> In 1985 a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> jury awarded <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> a $ 10.3 billion judgment. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> had appealed the judgment but eventually was forced by shareholders to settle with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> for $ 3 billion. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> pressured <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> into a restructuring, mainly through the sale of assets, to boost the company's stock price after the company's board rejected his friendly proposal to buy <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> for $ 60 a share. Last year, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> narrowly lost proxy fight for control of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s board. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has continued to increase his stake in <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> and earlier this week announced he controls 16.6 percent of the company. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> also disclosed he was considering the possibility of waging another contest for board seats at the annual shareholders meeting in May. Nevertheless, analysts said they were impressed with the price and the terms of the <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> sale as well as with the pace at which <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> has managed to complete its restructuring. `` Less than a year since emerging from bankruptcy, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> has been able to sell $ 7 billion in assets and pay down debt by $ 2.8 billion and improve earnings dramatically,'' said <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. When <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> first announced last year that <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> would be put on the auction block, observers speculated the company would fetch under $ 3 billion. In the last several weeks, that estimate had soared. In addition to the asset sales, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> has cut back operations and reorganized management. Other major asset sales in the last year have included its 99 percent interest in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION>, for $ 1.2 billion. Late last year, it completed the sale of 50 percent of its refining and marketing assets in 23 eastern and <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> states to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> for $ 800 million. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> has said it expects to realize $ 1.8 billion from that joint venture partnership with the Saudis.

 Technical factors and profit-taking have depressed the market for crude oil and refined petroleum products. In moderate trading Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the February contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, lost 42 cents to $ 18.86 a barrel, after rising 2 cents on Thursday. The contract, which was set to expire Friday, had reached a 14-month high on Wednesday after breaking the psychologically important $ 19-a-barrel level. It shot up to $ 19.45 a barrel at one point Thursday before falling back largely on profit-taking. Among refined contracts traded on the exchange Friday, February home heating oil settled 1.15 cents lower to 52.60 cents a gallon, after falling 0.86 cent on Thursday. The February contract for unleaded gasoline, which declined 0.16 cent in Thursday's session, settled at 51.78 cents a gallon Friday, down 0.32 cent. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, an energy analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday's price decline was mainly because of technical conditions, which included profit-taking from the earlier rally. But <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON> said the downturn also appeared to show a change in market sentiment to one of cautiousness from bullishness. `` It's a very jittery market right now,'' he said. Oil prices had risen steadily this year on the belief that the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will abide by a production-cutting pact that went into effect Jan. 1.

 <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said it has agreed to sell its 78 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 3.24 billion cash to <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The planned sale announced Friday would complete a major step in <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s post-Chapter 11 restructuring. Analysts said it appeared that <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> would raise more money than expected from the asset sales that are at the core of its reorganization. Toronto-based Imperial will pay <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> $ 34.36 a share for its 94.18 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> and agreed to make a $ 34.36-a-share tender offer for the remaining 26.59 million shares held by 4,500 minority stockholders. The total value of the deal for all 120.77 million <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> shares is $ 4.15 billion, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> said. In <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> rose 87 -LCB- cents to $ 55.62 -LCB- in heavy trading. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> closed up $ 1 at $ 34.12 -LCB- a share on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, after a trading halt for part of the session. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> also was expected to issue special common stock dividends Friday totaling 75 cents a share, out of which <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> will get $ 59.1 million, said <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Maneri </PERSON>. A previously announced special dividend of $ 6.50 -LRB- Canadian -RRB- a share to be issued Feb. 1 will give <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> another $ 514 million, and an additional one-for-one stock dividend issued to <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> shareholders in the newly-formed <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> will raise the total value of the deal for <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> to $ 3.9 billion, <PERSON> Maneri </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> was formed late last year to continue <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION>'s interest in production and exploration mainly in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. It is not part of the sale package. Imperial _ 70 percent owned by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ the biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil company _ is <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s largest integrated oil company, with $ 2.7 billion in sales in 1987 and 12,000 employees. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> is that nation's fourth-largest oil company, with 3,200 employees. The sale package includes, among other assets, two refineries with a combined capacity of 115,000 barrels a day and 1,800 service stations. The sale is subject to Canadian government approval. Analysts said they were impressed with the price that <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> fetched as well as with other terms of the deal. For example, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> will receive an additional $ 100 million if the deal is not completed by March 10, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Also, certain exploration and production properties in <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> were not included in the sale as some had expected The sale could face stiff opposition from those worried about growing corporate monopolies. However, <PERSON> Imperial </PERSON> said Friday that discussions with antitrust officials were under way and it had started to divest certain types of assets. The sale of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> marks one of the final steps in the massive restructuring <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> undertook in emerging from federal bankruptcy court protection last April. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> had hoped to raise some $ 5 billion in cash primarily through the sale of assets. With Friday's sale, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> tops its goal by more than $ 2 billion, analysts said. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> promised to issue $ 1.7 billion in proceeds from the sales to shareholders after being challenged last June in a proxy contest by its largest stockholder, takeover strategist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>. Promising the dividend helped <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> win the proxy fight, analysts said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive, said Friday that announcement of the distribution would be made `` as soon as practical.'' <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> again has been pressuring the company to increase the value of its stock, partly with the dividend payments raised by the asset sales. Sources have said <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON> did not want to sell the lucrative <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> but agreed to do so to win shareholder support. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, who owns 16.6 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, said this week he might mount another proxy fight to win control of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s board during the annual shareholders meeting in May if the asset sales did not produce the shareholder benefits he wanted. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> did not return calls Friday from The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Imperial beat out a string of other bidders, including <ORGANIZATION> Bond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, owned by Australian tycoon <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>.
