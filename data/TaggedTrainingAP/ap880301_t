 Slot machines line the walls of supermarkets and bars in this gaming resort, but they do n't belong in doughnut shops or laundries, officials decided. <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissioners </ORGANIZATION> voted Monday to prohibit new slot machine licenses for machines in laundries, bakeries, doughnut shops, fast-food restaurants, movie theaters and professional offices. Existing licenses are not affected. Several owners of self-service laundries said they depend on slot machine revenue to cover the high cost of doing business, with the slots generating about 25 percent of revenues. Other laundry owners stressed that customers need something to do to keep occupied while their clothes spin and tumble. Commissioners said it is too hard to regulate the machines if they are allowed to continue to proliferate in different businesses.

 Plainclothes police stormed a building housing an opposition party office and its radio station Tuesday, setting off a rock-throwing protest by foes of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s military rule. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON>, leader and presidential candidate of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1984, was beaten and arrested. <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON>, owner of Radio 10-FM, was released hours later. The plainclothes police and later a riot squad fired dozens of shots into the air to disperse the crowd outside the building. The brawl occurred as an anti-Noriega strike called by the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crusade </ORGANIZATION> entered its second day and appeared to be picking up support. Witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said plainclothes police with shotguns and pistols rushed into the Popular Action building on <ORGANIZATION> Via </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espana </ORGANIZATION>, smashing furniture and equipment inside the radio station. Radio 10-FM was under censorship orders to play only music, but had been broadcasting news supporting the strike. An angry crowd gathered outside the building and started throwing rocks at the officers. An unidentified radio station employee was slightly injured. Leaders of the Civil Crusade, a coalition of 180 business, professional, labor, student and political groups, told a news conference Tuesday night the strike shut down 85 percent of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s economic activity. They said 90 percent of industry and construction were paralyzed. They conceded that transportation was down by only 10 percent, but said retail commerce was 40 percent of normal. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Lastra </PERSON>, a Crusade leader and a strike organizer, said `` this demonstrates the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people's repudiation of the dictatorship of Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and the fervent desire for complete democracy. The government, through some of the news media it controls, has been calling the strike `` a complete failure,'' alleging business and transportation were functioning normally. The young security men at the radio station, dressed in jeans and T-shirts, outnumbered the protesters and broke up the demonstration after 40 minutes. The demonstrators were banging pots and pans in the streets and distributing leaflets. At least four men were punched, kicked and beaten with rubber truncheons during the melee as they were arrested and shoved into police vehicles. Two women were among those arrested on Via <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, an upper middle-class neighborhood. They were not beaten, but one was slapped on the buttocks as she was hustled into a car. At first only about 15 demonstrators from the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> were involved at the radio station building, but the crowd swelled to about 150 when residents came out on balconies or sidewalks to join in beating pans. Many people bolted for cover, however, when security agents came to screeching stops in 4-wheel-drive Toyotas. The agents jumped out and began shooting. Some residents returned to balconies from time to time, shouting `` Murderers!'' and `` Cowards!'' <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON>, leader of Popular Action, was beaten and shoved into a vehicle. The car was blocked by another vehicle and <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON>, a white-haired man of about 60, fled down the street with his torn shirt fluttering and security men in pursuit. Bystanders created interference and <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON> dived into a car that sped away, but he was caught later. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, ousted as president last week by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, remained in hiding Tuesday. He predicted serious economic trouble. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s successor, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of `` lies and defamation'' about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, the 17,000-member military and police organization commanded by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the real power behind the civilian government. Journalists saw at least three people wounded by birdshot fired by either the plainclothes agents or soldiers who arrived later. One man was bleeding from the head, but did not seem to be seriously injured. Calm was reported elsewhere in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. By midafternoon, the strike had drastically thinned traffic and the crowds on the streets. Strike leaders said 12 Panamanian-owned banks were closed. Most international banks opened, but did comparatively little business. Only one employee and five guards occupied the main area of the large <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> branch. The scenes were similar at <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>. Some international institutions shut down, including the Bank of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s replacement, inaugurated a new session of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> with an anti-American speech. The assembly, which <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> controls, dismissed <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> last Friday. `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been the victim of the most violent and terrible campaign of lies and defamation that any leader has ever received,'' <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> said. He accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and opponents of the government of `` the clear political intention of bringing ill repute on the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Defense Forces.'' He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` wants to asphyxiate the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people economically.'' <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been `` a traditional enemy'' of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` They send to our country destabilizing agents who try to sow chaos in a nation that let its entrails be opened to serve the world,'' he said in a reference to the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. Panamanian officials have claimed protests at home and the indictment of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on drug charges in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> are the work of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> conservatives who oppose the 1977 treaties under which the canal is to be turned over to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Dec. 31, 1999. In a videotape of <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> distributed by his associates, the former president pledged to remain in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and continue resistance to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. He said the crisis would make it impossible for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to get new loans from abroad and described the country as `` totally bankrupt.'' <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> predicted the lack of credit would force the government to raise taxes, which he said `` will increase unemployment and social unrest.''

<HEAD>Supreme Court Accepts First Drug Testing Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Mandatory drug testing in the workplace will be studied for the first time by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in a case that involves government workers but could have an impact on private businesses as well. The justices on Monday agreed to decide whether the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, in the interest of fighting drug smuggling, may force those applying for or holding drug-enforcement jobs to be tested. The court will hear arguments in the case next fall, with a decision on the constitutionality of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration program not expected until 1989. The court also may be called upon soon to study drug and alcohol testing for federal railway workers. A federal appeals court in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> ruled on Feb. 11 that the railway testing program is unconstitutional and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration said it will appeal that ruling to the high court. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Adler </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> said the high court's action on testing of government workers could influence private employers, depending on how broad the court ruling is. `` The big question is whether the court is going to determine this on a narrow, fact basis or will it attempt to articulate broad principles'' involving workers' reasonable expecations of privacy, he said. He said a narrow ruling relying on the special security needs of the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> would limit the impact in part because `` most -LRB- private -RRB- employers have shied away from random, generalized testing.'' But a sweeping endorsement of testing by the court could change that. The case before the justices is limited to whether public officials violate constitutional rights by testing those who are not suspected of using drugs. The outcome will affect tests conducted by federal, state or local governments but not by industry. Under the law, governments may not violate any rights protected by the Constitution, but private individuals or corporations have more leeway. <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> workers in sensitive jobs must provide urine samples in restroom stalls as a person overseeing the procedure waits outside the stall. The tests are conducted by an independent company hired by the service. Administration lawyers said the tests are needed to prevent agents who used drugs from being bribed or blackmailed. They said any sacrifice of personal privacy is outweighed by the need to stop drug smuggling. Government lawyers said the tests are particularly important now because the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> plans to recruit some 3,000 new employees, including many in the 18-25 age range in which use of illegal drugs is most prevalent. The Customs Service adopted the test procedure under an executive order President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed in 1986. The procedure is being challenged by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which said subjecting workers to the test is a humiliating invasion of privacy. The union welcomed the high court's intervention. Union President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobias </PERSON> said the court's ruling will clear up `` a legal and moral morass ... and, we hope, destroy <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s plans for wholesale testing of the federal work force.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, with 30,000 employees, has adopted random testing for its workers. The program covers those in safety-related jobs such as air traffic controllers, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> pilots and workers with high-rated security clearance. The Customs Service tests, which are not administered randomly, were upheld by the New Orleans-based 5th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. The appeals court said the tests may be considered searches but do not intrude unnecessarily on the privacy rights of workers. In other actions Monday, the court: _ Agreed to decide whether states may bar a man from trying to prove he fathered the child of a woman married to someone else The `` reverse paternity'' case challenges a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> law, similar to those in many other states, that always considers the woman's husband the father _ Asked the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, in a case from <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, whether it thinks high-stakes bingo games run by Indian tribes are subject to state sales taxes _ Said it will decide whether employees of a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> intelligence agency are entitled to administrative hearings when the government fires them as security risks

 While <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Republicans searched for a candidate for what many believe is a hopeless situation, Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> raised $ 1.32 million in preparation for his re-election bid. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> reports show the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat has $ 1.01 million in his campaign account after spending $ 457,640 during 1987. He raised $ 826,790 in the last six months of 1987 alone. `` We will have a strong candidate,'' promised <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON>, executive director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, in a recent interview. `` As of now, discussions are still going on.'' But it is no secret that the state's few big-name Republicans, including party chief <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamie </PERSON>, have no desire to put on a quixotic campaign against <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who is seeking his sixth term. One potential candidate is <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Carhart </PERSON>, a program analyst at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s strategic defense office who is considering a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> run. His family is from the <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> Carhart </PERSON> said in a recent interview he would decide in several weeks whether to run. <PERSON> Carhart </PERSON>, 44, is a graduate of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>.

But <PERSON> Carhart </PERSON> has little experience in politics and is a virtual unknown in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> strategists are quietly working to get a better-known candidate to run against <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. The senator's year-end <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> report showed he received most of his 1987 campaign contributions _ $ 1.06 million _ from individual contributors. The remaining $ 263,000 came from political action committees.

<HEAD>Reagan May Sign Bill Providing Only Humanitarian Aid To Contras</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is indicating he would sign a bill giving only humanitarian aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s rebels if it preserves his option of seeking military funds in the future. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the American Legion convention that `` preventing the consolidation of a pro-Soviet regime on the American mainland is a crucial test of national security.'' On the eve of today's scheduled <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> consideration of a humanitarian aid package, he seemed resigned to the fact there will be no immediate vote for military aid. `` Some say they're willing to support some type of humanitarian aid, but are doing everything they can do disband the freedom fighters,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` But there's nothing humanitarian about asking people to go up against Soviet attack helicopters armed only with boots and bandages.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> used the American Legion address to remind <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of his intentions as he prepared to leave for the summit with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> partners in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. He is concerned about possible showdown votes on <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> aid, first in the Rules Committee and later in the week on the House floor. The committee is weighing a $ 30.5 million Contra aid bill, sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, D-Mich., and other Democrats, which would provide no military assistance A rival Republican bill would be in much the same form as the $ 36.2 million piece of legislation that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had sought earlier this year, except there would be no money contained in the bill for a military escrow account. In an attempt to win enactment of the $ 36.2 million measure in early February, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> he would consult with leading lawmakers before releasing the $ 3.6 million in an escrow fund for military use. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> defeated the bill by eight votes. It was passed in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, but the vote was only symbolic. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s authority to carry out airlifts of supplies to the rebels expired at midnight. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not mention this Monday. But he did say that `` whatever package emerges from the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must include a provision for expedited procedures that would allow us to request official military aid to the freedom fighters should the peace process break down.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that since the $ 36.2 million Contra aid package was defeated, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have been ambivalent about promised reforms, causing <PERSON> Cardinal </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo to suspend peace talks he has been mediating. `` Unless the freedom fighters remain a viable force, the peace process will remain what it was before _ an empty charade, dragging endlessly and fruitlessly on while the Soviets continue the military buildup on the American mainland,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told his audience that if all assistance is stopped, the rebels `` will be picked off one by one'' by the leftist Sandinista regime in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. `` Are we going to cut them off now and leave them defenseless against the <PERSON> Sandinistas </PERSON>? If we do, who will ever trust in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> again? How can we remain a world power if we gain a reputation for pulling the plug on the people that placed their trust in us?''

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may be upset about the number of officers in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military, but the armed forces of some of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s closest allies are much more top-heavy, a survey has found. Of 11 nations surveyed by a military journal, only two had a lower ratio of admirals and generals to active-duty personnel than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Moreover, the No. 1 country among those surveyed _ <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> _ has built a military force whose ratio of generals and admirals to active-duty forces is more than three times that of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The survey was conducted by the monthly magazine `` Armed Forces Journal'' and the results summarized in its March issue, published today. The magazine said it contacted the defense ministries directly or else turned to foreign embassies in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the information needed to make a comparison of active-duty forces. <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> possesses easily the leanest of the military establishments surveyed, with just 5 generals leading an active-duty force of 54,700, the survey found. That translates to just 0.9 generals per 10,000 active-duty personnel, the magazine reported. The next eight countries fall into a range that runs from 4 generals and admirals per 10,000 active-duty personnel to about 9 generals per 10,000. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is in this group with a ratio of 4.9 generals and admirals for every 10,000 active-duty personnel. The final two countries _ <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> _ are in a class by themselves, the magazine reported. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has 476 generals and admirals to lead its 320,000 men and women on active duty, or a ratio of 14.9 per 10,000, while <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> has 141 generals and admirals for 87,254 active-duty personnel, or a ratio of 16.2 per 10,000. At the other end of the scale, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> followed <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> with 199 generals and admirals for its 495,000 on active duty, or a ratio of 4.0 generals and admirals per 10,000 troops. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has slightly more than 2.1 million men and women under arms. As of November, when the information was compiled, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had authorized 1,073 slots for generals and admirals and 1,057 of those jobs were filled. Either number produces the same ratio of roughly 4.9 per 10,000. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, complaining about what it calls `` grade creep,'' imposed the cap of 1,073 active-duty slots for generals and admirals in 1981. Lawmakers have refused ever since to raise it despite repeated Pentagon entreaties. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in its fiscal 1987 budget to begin reducing the number of lower-ranking officers in the military. The Pentagon is under orders to reduce its officer corps of colonels and captains by 6 percent by fiscal 1990 _ or more than 18,000 job slots. Before the cutting began, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> had more than 308,700 officers on active duty, or roughly one officer for every 5.9 enlisted personnel. By next September, that number must fall to 302,620, with additional cuts to follow.

<HEAD>IRS Rules Allowed Contras To Bypass Paperwork For New Foundation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Contra rebels, looking for a tax-exempt organization to carry out fund raising, used a legal shortcut to take over a foundation begun by political conservatives to promote understanding of `` governmental systems.'' By reconstituting an existing foundation, the Contras avoided the time nd lengthy application process generally entailed in applying to the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> for tax-exempt status. What now goes by the name of the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> was originally the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Davis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> records. The Contra foundation has not filed its first tax return yet because the changeover occurred just last fall. The Lodge foundation stated in its application for tax-exempt status in 1982 that its purpose would be to `` foster, develop and promote, among people of the world, in a nonpartisan basis, a greater understanding and awareness of comparative governmental systems, international policies and the relationships between sovereign states.'' The late <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Lodge </PERSON> was a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> governor and congressman, and ambassador to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. The grandson of Sen. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabot </PERSON> <PERSON> Lodge </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, he was an ardent anti-communist and chaired <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1980 presidential campaign in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. He died in 1985 at age 82. He was also a mentor to conservative political consultant <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Stone set up the Lodge foundation in 1982 to host forums and publish educational materials. `` It was set up as a hardline anti-communist'' organization, but the foundation never really got off the ground and published only one monograph by former <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Ambassador <PERSON> Jeane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said. Last fall, <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> learned from his wife that the rebels needed a foundation to collect money for their cause. It so happens that <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> has a direct mail fund-raising business and the Contras are one of her clients. `` She had something to do with it,'' <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said of the idea to turn his foundation over to the Contras. `` She made the argument it was consistent with the original purposes of the foundation.'' So last October, Stone and two business partners, <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON>, whom <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> had installed as original board members, met and voted themselves off the board. They turned the organization over to newly elected board members <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Palazio </PERSON>, the Contras' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> spokesman, and two <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> officials, <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Somarriba </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeledon </PERSON>. Now the foundation is the principal conduit for funds the Contras are raising privately. The rebels have placed increasing emphasis on these efforts in the wake of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' recent rejection of new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. The Contras say the money they are raising from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens is for humanitarian aid only. Raising money for weapons is not a tax-exempt function, and <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> backers ran afoul of that law in last year's Iran-Contra scandal. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> permits changes in purpose and makeup of a foundation as long as the new group is still within the guidelines of tax-exempt purposes, said <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadely </PERSON>. The Contra foundation in December received $ 140,000 from the fund created in memory of the late CIA Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> officials said the money was for a rehabilitation hospital for their wounded and maimed soldiers.

 The government still prints money on paper for all debts public and private, but the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration says it will gladly take plastic. The Office of Management and Budget on Monday announced a new progam to increase dramatically the government's use of credit cards _ both for buying and selling. Not only will the government start accepting credit cards from the public for such items as passports and payments on college loans, but the <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> said it also hopes to develop a plan under which government officials and purchasing agents will use cards. `` Eventually, the Office of Management and Budget will be able to require that all purchases made -LRB- by the government -RRB- under $ 2,500 be by credit card,'' the <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> said in President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` management'' report on the federal government In fact, the report itself can be purchased by mail with VISA or <ORGANIZATION> MasterCard </ORGANIZATION>, for $ 6.50. -LRB- The president's fiscal 1989 budget costs $ 18 -RRB-. Budget Director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> news briefing he did have a few qualms about use of credit cards as an alternative to legal tender _ for a goverment that was $ 150 billion in the red last year. But, he added, by allowing citizens to repay their government debts with credit cards, `` We're collecting some of this -LRB- debt -RRB- rather than just letting it ride.'' Under the expanded program, the government is expected to process 130 million credit-card transactions annually by 1991, or $ 6.5 billion worth, said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, deputy <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> director. `` It will make us the largest credit card user in the world,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, however, that the cards wo n't be accepted for tax payments _ at least not yet. That would require seeking legislation from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, something the administration is n't now prepared to do. However, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said the subject is being explored with the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The government for some time has accepted credit cards for specified items, including publications of the Government Printing Office. More recently, the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has accepted credit cards for duty collection at most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airports and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Mint is now accepting them for coin sales. The management report also said that the government is studying, for possible future use, a system under which `` smart cards'' would be issued by the government to people who receive Social Security and other payments and benefits. `` These cards -LRB- would -RRB- have embedded on them information about the cardholder that can be accessed electronically. Potentially -LRB- the -RRB- cards could make available funds for food stamps, social security payments, or grants and control their use electronically through central computers.'' And what's to keep the government from running up large interest payments on its past-due credit card accounts, just like it has with the national debt? `` We're not going to pay -LRB- interest -RRB- because we're not going to let them go beyond 30 days,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Soviet officials are optimistic about a strategic arms accord being reached before a summit this summer despite President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s remark last week that not enough time is left. The Soviets hope major disagreements in the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks can be settled at a March 22-23 meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> between Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and his Soviet counterpart <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. `` We remain optimistic,'' said a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> diplomat who has been involved in the negotiations in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on long-range weapons. He spoke only on condition of anonymity. `` We are near the finishing line,'' he said, and `` there is still plenty of time'' before <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> meet. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> ordered their aides to draft, before that March meeting, agreements on three areas: verifying compliance, dismantling weapons, and exchanging data on the arsenals. `` These three drafts constitute the bulk of the work to be done'' on the treaty, although several major points of disagreement remain, the Soviet official said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in an interview published last Friday by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, said he did not think it possible to reach an accord before the summit, which is expected in late May or early June. `` We're not at this moment anticipating that it would be ready for signature then,' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. But he said the deal was possible before he leaves office next January. The proposed treaty would cut strategic nuclear arsenals by 35 percent to 50 percent, setting a limit of 6,000 on the overall number of warheads with ranges of more than 3,400 miles. The Soviets are balking at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand to limit the number of warheads on land-based missiles to 3,300 and the number of warheads aboard so-called heavy missiles to 1,650, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. And the Soviets want to set a limit on numbers of sea-launched cruise missiles, above the 6,000 warhead ceiling. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have objected to such a limit, in part because it would be difficult to verify. The Soviet official repeated a remark by <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that technology exists to detect nuclear weapons aboard naval vessels, a statement that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts question. `` Such things as sublimits need to be worked out at the highest political levels,'' such as the Shultz-Shevardnadze meeting in March, the official said. `` The bulk of the work, the technical details, is in the three drafts and needs to be worked out at the expert level'' before the tough political decisions, he said. The official also said the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> might drop its objections to tests in space of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Star Wars missile defense system if some limits could be negotiated beforehand. He said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would countenance some space tests as long as both sides agreed they did not violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The diplomat noted that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> agreed at the December summit in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to abide by the ABM treaty. But the joint communique issued at summit did not address U.S.-Soviet disagreement on the extent to which the treaty restricted space tests of weapons such as lasers and other devices that were not in use when the ABM pact was signed. The Soviets are seeking a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> response to their proposal to set limits on tests for various Star Wars components such as lasers, the official said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators have rejected such limits, saying that compliance would be impossible to verify in space.

 Here, at a glance, is the latest on AIDS.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>WHAT IT IS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious disease that destroys the body's immune system. It is incurable and usually fatal. Death comes from infections or cancers that the body can not fight.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>WHAT CAUSES IT</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 AIDS is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, and is spread through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, transfusion of infected blood or blood products, or from an infected birthing mother to her baby.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>WHO GETS IT</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Chief victims of AIDS have been homosexual men and intravenous drug abusers. Health officials estimate that heterosexual contact is responsible for 4 percent of cases and that between 1 million and 1.5 million Americans have been exposed to the virus.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>HOW IT'S DETECTED</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Screening for AIDS is conducted by testing blood for the presence of antibodies to the AIDS virus. The test tells only if a person has been exposed to the virus. A person with a positive test has a 20 percent to 30 percent chance of developing AIDS over a five-year period, according to the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>HOW MANY HAVE IT</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 As of Feb. 22, AIDS had been diagnosed in 54,233 Americans, of whom more than half, or 30,355, have died since June 1, 1981, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>POSSIBLE TREATMENTS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Numerous types of medicines against the AIDS virus are now being studied. They are in three categories: antivirals that combat the virus; anti-infectives that treat the opportunistic infections and malignancies that occur with AIDS; and immune modulators that strengthen the immune system. An antiviral, AZT -LRB- for azidothymidine -RRB-, has received <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> approval and early results show it is effective in halting progress of the AIDS virus. At least 16 other antivirals are in some stage of development and testing. Scientists also are searching for a vaccine against the virus, but this research is in early stages.

 A congressional critic of federal officials' flying in style on taxpayer-supplied executive aircraft says he's unhappy with an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> move to clip the wings of the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., expressed his displeasure Monday after the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> told him the corps had been been stripped of day-to-day control of three aircraft that have been called wasteful by <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and congressional auditors <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ambrose </PERSON>, who stepped down Friday as undersecretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, said he ordered the executive aircraft placed in a central pool, forcing the corps brass to compete against other <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> commanders for their use. `` The pooled operation, we anticipate, will yield economies,'' <PERSON> Ambrose </PERSON> told <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>'s Government Operations subcommittee on environment, energy and natural resources. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Elvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Heiberg </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, the three-star chief of engineers, told the hearing that `` I concur with the decision made by my boss. ... We'll have to compete.'' Last summer, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the corps had been using the aircraft not for emergencies such as floods but for routine and ceremonial matters, many of them overseas trips on which leaders were accompanied improperly by spouses. <PERSON> Ambrose </PERSON> said that before they can use any of the aircraft, <PERSON> Heiberg </PERSON> and other corps leaders will have to get flight-by-flight permission from the director of <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> staff in the Pentagon. <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> said he was displeased because the director of staff has been responsible for authorizing travel by corps spouses, who <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> regulations say must have an `` unquestionable official'' role in a government-financed trip. `` Unless he does a better job than he has done with spouse travel, this is n't going to be much of a safeguard,'' <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Heiberg </PERSON> and other corps officials have defended their use of the aircraft on grounds that they are more efficient than commercial flights. <PERSON> Ambrose </PERSON>'s action partially settled an in-Army fight between the corps and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> auditors, who said last year that tax dollars could be saved by selling the planes and having corps officials use commercial or charter flights. <PERSON> Ambrose </PERSON> said the Army would decide later this year whether to sell the aircraft, including Castle I, the 14-passenger jet that has been used to ferry key members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on trips to visit water projects around the nation. Before the aircraft can be sold, however, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will have to repeal a law forbidding such a sale. The prohibition was quietly enacted in December at the behest of one of those flyers, Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bevill </PERSON>, D-Ala., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee that handles corps funding <PERSON> Bevill </PERSON> said he disagreed with the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> auditors and with similar findings made over the years by the congressional <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. `` All three planes are needed,'' <PERSON> Bevill </PERSON> said. `` They do their best work when there's floods and emergencies.''

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Emmett </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>'s handling of the 1985 vote fraud trial of three <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> civil rights activists has come under fire during a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hearing on his nomination to the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Stavis </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, told the panel Monday that <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> displayed `` an intolerance toward and a failure to respect'' a black lawyer involved in the trial and issued rulings that raised questions about his sensitivity to racial issues. <PERSON> Stavis </PERSON>' testimony marked the second time that the vote fraud trial has been used as the basis for opposing one of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s judicial nominees. The trial, which civil rights groups charged was part of an effort by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to intimidate black voters in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, ended in innocent verdicts for all three activists. It then became the focal point of a 1986 campaign by civil rights groups against <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s nomination of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney Jefferson B. Sessions III to a federal judgeship in south <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. Sessions, who was prosecutor at the vote fraud trial, was rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, marking the first time that one of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s judicial nominees has been voted down in committee. While the Sessions nomination drew opposition from a host of civil rights groups, <PERSON> Stavis </PERSON> was the only witness Monday who testified in opposition to <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION>. The committee did not vote on the nomination, but Sen. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, D-Ala., who presided at the hearing, predicted that <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> would win <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation within a month <PERSON> Stavis </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>'s decision during the 1985 trial to bring criminal contempt of court charges against <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> lawyer who represented one of the activists. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> had ruled that <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s questioning of a witness violated his order barring defense attorneys from raising the issue of selective prosecution. That contempt ruling later was reversed by the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stavis </PERSON>, who represented <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that `` there was absolutely no foundation'' for the contempt charge. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> acknowledged Monday that the appeals court had `` fairly concluded'' that he had been wrong to cite <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> for contempt. `` They educated me on the law of criminal contempt,'' he said. <PERSON> Stavis </PERSON> also charged that <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> had shown a lack of racial sensivitity by refusing to delay the trial for two weeks so the jury could be selected from a jury pool drawn from the <LOCATION> Selma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, area, which had a much larger percentage of blacks than did the jury pool drawn from the Mobile, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, area. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> declined during the hearing to respond specifically to <PERSON> Stavis </PERSON>' testimony about the jury selection issue. But he told reporters afterwards that racial considerations played no part in his handling of the case.

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration says it wo n't go forward with $ 105 million in retaliatory sanctions against <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> at this time, citing `` some progress'' in relaxing trade barriers against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> computer software sales. The administration earlier this year announced that it would slap the duties on a variety of Brazilian products to protest the restrictions. However, since then there has been a thaw in U.S.-Brazilian relations, both on the trade and Third World debt front. A new software law in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, which calls for a new set of regulations governing imports of foreign-made computer programs and other software, helped prompt the administration decision to delay its sanctions. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, citing `` recent progress,'' in the dispute, said in a statement on Monday: `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will delay sanctions against <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> pending review of the implementing regulations for <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s new software law. `` Subsequent to that, we will review our options and consider what actions, if any, to take.'' The list of specific Brazilian exports to be targeted had never been released, even though a preliminary list included Brazilian-made shoes, aircraft, automobiles and electronics equipment. The issue of access of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> computer software companies to markets in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> `` will remain a high priority for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. `` Recent Brazilian actions, and discussions with representatives of the government of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, demonstrate progress on this issue,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. `` Some of our immediate concerns have now been met.'' The new Brazilian law will regulate commercial sales of all software, both domestic and foreign. It calls for new regulations to be issued by April 19. `` As a result, we feel it would be inappropriate and counterproductive to proceed with our previously announced plans to retaliate,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. `` That proposed action will be placed on hold until we have a chance to evaluate <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s response on the software regulations.'' Adding to the atmosphere of eased relations between <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and its key trading partners has been <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s participation in negotiations on a loan restructuring package. Key portions of that pact were reached over the weekend as <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest debtor nation, agreed to make a $ 700 million interest payment to make it current for all of 1988 and the last quarter of 1987. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> has n't repaid any principal on its $ 114 billion foreign debt since 1983. In February 1987, it decreed a moratorium on interest payments but late last year agreed to resume them.

Another $ 6.4 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average discount rate of 5.86 percent, up from 5.83 percent last week. The rates on three-month bills were the lowest since 5.49 percent on Nov. 30 while the six-month bills were the highest since they averaged 6.03 percent on Feb. 16. The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors _ 5.78 percent for three-month bills with a $ 10,000 bill selling for $ 9,857.90 and 6.12 percent for a six-month bill selling for $ 9,703.70.

 The cat came to stay but the Capitol mice played anyway _ around an ambassador's feet. House Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., has a mouse problem He shares it with other members of the Democratic leadership who occupy offices in the oldest part of the Capitol, the part that survived after the British burned the building in 1814. The mice call it home but <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders and their staffs call it disturbing. So traps were set and baited with cheese. The mice ignored then. Then <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> called in reinforcements. He brought his cat to work, a feline with a proven reputation as a champion mouser. The cat moved in with the <ORGANIZATION> Foleys </ORGANIZATION> a dozen years ago while they were on vacation in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. Since the cat had chosen them, and not they the cat, they gave the animal an appropriate name _ `` <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> the Lodger.'' <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> was brought in to lodge for awhile in <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s office suite on the first floor of the Capitol, sharing quarters not only with the mice but with <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s dog, <PERSON> Alice </PERSON>, who accompanies the majority leader to work on a daily basis. Expectations ran high for <PERSON> Roger </PERSON>. But the results were poor. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> the Lodger bagged no mice. The mouser's failure was underscored on Monday during a meeting in an adjoining office used by Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, D-Mich., the chief deputy Democratic leader <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON> was conferring over coffee with <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinast </PERSON>, the Polish ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Suddenly a mouse darted out from behind a small chest. It ran across the carpet and disappeared under the conference table, literally at the startled ambassador's feet. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership is looking for a new weapon in its war against mice.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s sergeant at arms _ <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Giugni </PERSON> _ became an instant celebrity last week when he followed orders and arrested Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore. <PERSON> Giugni </PERSON>'s posse had <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> carried onto the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor to constitute a quorum so consideration could continue of a controversial campaign financing act, then besieged by a filibuster It was not the first time a senate sergeant of arms has been the focus of attention by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the press. On Feb. 7, 1935, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted to fire Sergeant at Arms <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s offense: The 72-year-old former journalist had written a magazine article entitled `` Over the Hill to Demagoguery'' which he had thought would be published after he left office. But the publication date was moved up and when the article appeared it began with these words: `` Contrary, perhaps, to the popular belief, there are not many crooks in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>; that is out and out grafters, or those who are willing to be such. `` There are not many senators or representatives who sell their votes for money, and it is pretty well known who those few are. `` But there are many demagogues.'' Senate Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who recounted the incident on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor recently, said the article probably would have been ignored had it been written by a journalist. `` But for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s sergeant at arms it was an entirely different matter,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` So the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted him out of office, less than a month before his term would have ended.''

 It does n't take much time. And it does n't cost much money. And it makes somebody somewhere happy. So <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> over the decades has busily subdivided the calendar into days, weeks, months and even years in honor of some historic figure, event, cause, profession or industry or thing. It was in that spirit early last month that Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., offered a resolution designating the week of Oct. 30 through Nov. 5 as <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jukebox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Week </ORGANIZATION> `` As a rich chronicler of music, culture and technology, the jukebox is without peer,'' <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON> informed the House. `` It has brought great joy and memories to generations of Americans. Its popularity is unequaled in the eyes of young and old alike.'' Besides, he said, the juke box is on the advent of its centennial. The very first juke box, a wax cylinder Edison phonograph fitted with a coin slot, was installed in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Palais </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Royale </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Saloon </LOCATION> in 1889. Just the thing, the <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON> resolution said, to be observed `` with appropriate programs, ceremonies and activities.'' But if juke boxes bore, perhaps doll houses are the ticket. Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, wants to designate the week of October 9 as National Dollhouse Week. After all, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> contended, `` about 10 percent of our population has some involvement with dollhouse and miniature collecting.'' The source of that statistic, he disclosed, is the <ORGANIZATION> Miniatures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> is hinting he may delay <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> consideration of the new U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms reduction treaty if the White House ends <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to insurgents in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> before a complete and final Soviet troop withdrawal. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, commented shortly before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 77-0 on Monday to adopt a resolution urging the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> not to cut off, suspend or reduce military aid to the <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> resistance `` until it is absolutely clear that the Soviets have terminated their military occupation The non-binding resolution also urged formation of an interim government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> acceptable to the Afghan resistance. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said the resolution is intended to `` send a clear message'' to the administration that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> wants no part of any U.S.-Soviet agreement in which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the Afghan resistance is ended merely on <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s promise to withdraw its troops, not on their actual removal. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> and Sens. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, took strong exception to congressional testimony last week in which <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>, an assistant deputy secretary of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be prepared, `` if completely satisfied with the overall agreement, to prohibit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military assistance to the <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> resistance.'' <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> also testified last week: `` We will continue our assistance ... until that support is no longer needed. But the question of when to cut off aid is one that should be left to the president.'' <PERSON> Symms </PERSON> said <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>'s testimony leads many to fear a `` superpower deal ... that will allow the Soviets to gain politically what they could not gain on the battlefield.'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said, `` I'd like to know what's in these agreements before I call up the INF -LRB- Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces -RRB- treaty,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. `` I do n't want the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> kept in the dark,'' he added.

<HEAD>International Study Shows American Students Far Behind</HEAD>

 Students in most other countries are far better educated in science than are American students, according to an international study that one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said emphasizes `` the troubled state of science education in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' In a report released Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> students at three different grade levels all scored well behind those from most other nations, with some American 14-year-olds scoring at the level of the `` scientifically illiterate.'' `` For a technologically advanced country, it would appear that -LRB- in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB- a re-examination of how science is presented and studied is required,'' said the study, which was conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evaluation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Achievement </ORGANIZATION>, an association of research centers. <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, said of the study: `` These findings emphasize again the troubled state of science education in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. ... <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future as a world technological and economic leader and the quality of life we enjoy depend on confronting the real problems in science education with vigor, determination and a sense of urgency.'' The study was conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evaluation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Achievement </ORGANIZATION>, an association of research centers. Early findings, which compared the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> only with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and with partial findings from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, were reported by The Associated Press in September. The comparative study was based on tests administered to 204,308 students at 7,581 schools in 24 countries between 1983 and 1986. The tests were given at three academic levels: near the end of primary grades, at about age 10; at grades eight and nine, about age 14; and in the final year of high school. Among 10-year-olds, students in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> scored around 15.4 out of 24 possible correct answers. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> students scored just below the middle of the scale at 13.2. Among 14-year-olds, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> scored at the top, while Americans ranked third from last with a mean score of 16.5 out of 30 possible correct answers. The lowest-scoring quarter of this age group, the report said, `` were scientifically illiterate'' with their test scores `` at chance level.'' Tests for the high school seniors were given only to those specializing in science subjects. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> scored highest, with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> students receiving among the lowest marks. In an analysis of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> results, the report said: `` The achievement of advanced science students in biology, chemistry and physics is low. The biology results are especially low.'' The study said that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, along with <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, has `` many poor scoring schools and it would seem likely that the school authorities would have grounds for concern.'' Secretary of Education <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, responding to a report of the study, said it supports an assessment on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> education that his department released last week. `` Now comes this international report card showing that compared to students in other countries, American elementary and high school students are not just in a ` dead stall,' they're doing even worse,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. `` They're in reverse and going downhill.'' The international study also compared the difference in science achievement based on gender. In grades five and nine, boys scored higher than girls in all countries. For grade 12, boys outperformed girls in biology, chemistry and physics, except in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, where girls had top marks in biology.

 <ORGANIZATION> Owens-Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has acquired virtually all outstanding shares of <ORGANIZATION> Brockway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> stock to the tune of about $ 740 million and is on the verge of creating the nation's largest glass container company, offcials say. Monday's move followed a decision by the government against appealing a court decision in favor of the merger. <ORGANIZATION> Owens-Illinois </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said the company bought 12,337,630 shares of common <PERSON> Brockway </PERSON> stock, 98.7 percent of the outstanding shares. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said the actual merger will likely occur in a couple of weeks, at which time the remaining shares will be purchased. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanigan </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Owens-Illinois </ORGANIZATION>, said the merger will make the combined operations and the glass container industry `` significantly more competitive with can, plastic and other materials in the worldwide packaging business.'' <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ticknor </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, declined to specify why the agency decided against appealing a decision by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> that, in effect, paving the way for the merger. However, Ms. <PERSON> Ticknor </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> has scheduled administrative hearings on potential anticompetitive effects of the merger. And she said <ORGANIZATION> Owens-Illinois </ORGANIZATION> could be ordered to divest itself of <PERSON> Brockway </PERSON> holdings if the agency determines that the merger violates antitrust laws. The <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, based <ORGANIZATION> Owens-Illinois </ORGANIZATION> proposed to buy <PERSON> Brockway </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, last September for $ 60 a share. The merger will make the combined company the nation's largest manufacturer of glass containers, which are used in packaging foods and beverages. The largest producer of glass containers has been <ORGANIZATION> Anchor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Container </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Owens-Illinois </ORGANIZATION> officials have said the only weapon the glass container industry has against plastics and metal packaging producers is competitive pricing and the merger with <PERSON> Brockway </PERSON> is designed to increase productivity and lower costs. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> had attempted in court to block the merger, saying it might violate antitrust laws by substantially reducing competition and creating the conditions for price discrimination. However, last month <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hens </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> denied the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION>'s request for a preliminary injunction on the basis that the agency had failed to prove the deal would harm competition. And last Friday, the appeals court sided with Judge <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, saying that the agency had failed to make its case.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s surprise second-place finish in the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Democraatic caucuses was a `` breakthrough,'' proving conclusively that he has broadened his appeal, his backers say. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> reaped 28 percent of the vote in the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> contest on Sunday, on the heels of respectable showings in three other states which, like <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, all have voting age black populations of 1 percent or less. The <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> results came after he spent just $ 13,000 in the state and campaigned there only two days. The well-funded winner, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, is well known to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> voters as governor of nearby <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and he captured 42 percent. `` It shows that we can get votes in any part of the country,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Monday in <LOCATION> Pembroke </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> `` It shows we have the broadest base ... and our campaign has the strongest appeal.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> is coming alive,'' he added, invoking the name he has given to his target constituency of all minority groups and the economically oppressed. Political consultant <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, an informal <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> adviser, called <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> `` the most significant breakthrough state for him so far.'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON>, a top political strategist for <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s 1984 presidential bid, said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s performance is `` a sign of a growing movement among non-black supporters of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, and for people to try to ignore it, they're making a great mistake.'' In <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> finished fourth out of seven contenders. In <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> he was second with 20 percent in last week's caucuses. In <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 28 percent contrasted to the 1 percent that he got when he ran in 1984. Campaign manager <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said he knew his candidate would do well in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and the goal was to come in second. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s margin, well above the single-digit results of the other Democrats, was better than he had anticipated He credited it to organizing by students and dedicated volunteers _ the campaign had only two paid staff people in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. `` It was basically, totally indigenous and independent,'' he said of the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> organization. `` They did things on their own.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s core support came out of the university communities in <LOCATION> Orono </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, and striking paper workers in <PERSON> Jay </PERSON>, he said. He carried <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> and another of the state's largest cities, <LOCATION> Bangor </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> bought $ 10,000 worth of TV ads in the days before the caucuses, and $ 2,000 on radio. The 10-second TV spots showed the winning <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goal in the 1980 Olypic hockey game against the Soviets, with an announcer saying as <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s picture appeared: `` Just like in the Olympics, one man can make a difference.'' <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON>, who called <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` one of the best hidden political stories of the year,'' commented also, `` People do n't want to buy the notion that <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has got a message that people listen to and that has begun to rise above his blackness ... Somebody in this party has to to recognize that this is a significant guy in the party.'' Political analyst <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, however, questioned whether <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s white votes are really the downtrodden whom he has targeted. He cited exit polls from <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> showing a good portion of his votes came from upscale, well-educated liberals, `` the radical chic.'' But he also noted that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has a strong message that appeals to many Democrats. `` There is no other candidate in the race who really stands for the old politics ... what I would call Democratic fundamentalism,'' as espoused by the late Sen. <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>. <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON> said people `` consistently underestimate'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` He's the most charismatic candidate in the field. He's got a message that's concise, that does not change from place to place.'' <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Democratic chairman <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Barton </PERSON> said timing was a key for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s successful appearance at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Orono </LOCATION> on Feb. 11, just after <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s caucuses and just before the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary, was `` just the right time ... when <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Democrats were starting to lock in,'' he said. <PERSON> Barton </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> probably also picked up about 5 percentage points from people who defected from the flagging campaigns of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has issued an early St. Patrick's Day message, saying he wanted to acknowledge `` the world of debt we owe to the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> people.'' Although his message came two and a half weeks ahead of time, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Monday took note of the March 17 commemoration, saying the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> people `` have created and perpetuated a unique heritage of faith and freedom, of humor and hope, of scholarship and sanctity and sacrifice.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who is of Irish ancestry, went on to say: `` With faith and fearlessness, <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> brought Christianity to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> a millennium and a half ago.

 It's a far cry from the Capitol, but it's got most of the comforts of home Impeached Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> still goes to work early and stays late. But his office-in-exile is in a house he once lived in, across an alley from a hay barn in the far reaches of this <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> suburb. His days are filled with meetings and phone calls, he says, leaving not much time to follow his televised impeachment trial, which opened Monday in the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` No, I did n't watch,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said. `` I've been busy. I've got a lot to do.'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> met with supporters and attended a meeting downtown. He took time to hold a news conference in what used to be a sunken living room. But he did n't hang on every vote in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which on Monday decided the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s impeachment document was sufficient for trial. `` Frankly, I have n't tracked the vote and I have n't tried to interpret anything,'' he said. His paid staff of five worked on one side of the 7,000-square-foot ranch-style house while volunteers worked on the other side to raise money for the governor's legal defense and recall election campaign. Plans were being readied for a Wednesday night rally. Some 300 phone calls come in each day, spokesman <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. The house was converted into office space before <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was impeached Feb. 5 and replaced by acting Gov. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, the former secretary of state. Outside, a simple sign identifies the `` Governor <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> Headquarters,'' and adds, `` Office Space Available. Inquire Within.'' The building sits between a farm full of sheep, chickens and roosters, and a Mormon church. Police sometimes guard the front door, and a security system is in place. Monday's proceedings made the switchboard light up, a receptionist said, including a series of obscene phone calls. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said he wo n't venture downtown to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> unless it's necessary `` When my attorney tells me I should be there, I'll be there,'' he said. He said he was disappointed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chose not to grant requests for a delay in the trial since his new chief counsel has been on the case less than a week, but was confident in his defense. `` We have no choice. We have a time to get ready by,'' he said. `` I feel confident we'll be able to get our case out and I think we'll be successful,'' the governor said. `` If the decision is made on the evidence, I expect to get 29 votes.'' One member of the 30-member chamber is absent from the trial because of illness. A two-thirds vote is needed to convict <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was impeached on allegations of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan, misusing $ 80,000 from a special fund and attempting to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat involving a state official. He also has been indicted in state district court on six felony counts involving the $ 350,000 loan, which amounted to about a third of his campaign funds, and faces a criminal trial March 22. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> also faces a recall election May 17.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has turned distinctly chilly toward <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> ahead of this week's <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit here, apparently worried the Soviet leader may be wooing the West too well. `` The Russian bear was easier to deal with when it looked more like a bear than it does now,'' aides quoted Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> as telling a private meeting of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> ambassadors on Feb. 17. `` The nicer the Russians get, the more dangerous they are.'' Her remarks underlined the dilemma of the right-wing British leader who has developed a warm personal relationship with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. She now appears in a bind over how to keep encouraging <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s internal reforms without also encouraging sentiment for a further erosion in nuclear weapons and military spending in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on grounds the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is no longer much of a threat. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> aides deny she has done a U-turn on the Soviet leader she once hailed as someone `` I can do business with,'' and who gave her a red carpet welcome on an official visit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last spring. But British officials acknowledge alarm over <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s relatively benign image in the West <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general, indicated that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> may succeed in dividing the 16-nation <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> by generating complacency. `` It is rather a curious paradox that it's much easier to hold the alliance together when they're frightened than when they're not,'' <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> said in a recent <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> radio interview `` But the fact still remains that there is an enormous military potential on the other side of the Eastern border.'' Polls indicate a more relaxed attitude among West Europeans to the neighboring Communist giant under the urbane <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. A survey by <PERSON> Datagroep </PERSON> of <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> among 6,064 people in nine <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries last spring indicated that nearly two-thirds thought that public views of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had recently grown warmer. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who has been among <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s most outspoken admirers in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, appears to have helped the shift in public opinion. After her <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> visit last spring a Gallup sounding reported that 58 percent of Britons thought the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` really wanted to be friendly with the West.'' Just 33 percent thought Soviet advances should be treated `` with the greatest suspicion.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Economist weekly commented: `` Could that in part be a result of the flattering attentions the prime minister has been happy to receive from Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>?''

<TEXT>
 The debate-a-day Democratic presidential field was scattered across the Super Tuesday landscape today after a forum in which Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was singled out for attacks on his trade policy, tax vote and the contributions he has taken from special interests. In one of the liveliest debates of the campaign, the Democrats spelled out differences on trade, taxes and foreign debt with bare-knuckled zest, sparing not even the moderator who was chided by <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for asking `` a race-based question.'' After the third Democratic debate in as many days, the contenders were campaigning in states that will hold primaries or caucuses on March 8, the most delegate-rich day in the history of presidential politics. Shortly after Monday's debate ended, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> flew South to meet with former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and receive the endorsement of two former governors of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was campaigning in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>; Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, former <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> in the state of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> took heat for his acceptance of campaign contributions from political action committees, for his vote for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1981 tax cut and for his trade policy. When <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> for taking PAC contributions, the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman retorted that to suggest that members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would `` take direction on how to vote is an affront.'' Then <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said he was certain the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor accepted contributions from people who did business with his state, which prompted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to reply, `` I am not running around the country beating up on the establishment.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said he often got contributions from people even though they opposed his position on individual issues. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> interjected that `` lobbyists would lose their jobs if they gave money continuously against the interests of who they were working for.'' `` Do you think the Reagan-Gephardt tax bill of 1981 was fair?'' asked <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. The senator from <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> kept repeating the question and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> kept saying, `` Are you finished?'' Finally, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said he thought the bill was fair because it cut taxes for middle-income families. When <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> asked his question once again, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> snapped, `` Can you hear, <PERSON> Al </PERSON>?'' During an exchange on how to deal with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s foreign debt, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the oil import fee supported by <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> would ruin the Mexican economy. `` Are you running for president of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>?'' asked the congressman. `` If I'm president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, I'm going to pay attention to that country,'' responded <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Twice, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> interjected, `` Let the record show, Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did n't answer the question.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> passed up the debate, which was held on the campus of the College of <PERSON> William </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> and was sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, an organization of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> officials who banded together out of concern over what they saw as the party's leftward drift and the failure of its presidential candidates to appeal to voters in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and West One of the most dramatic exchanges took place when moderator <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodruff </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> correspondent of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> MacNeil-Lehrer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hour </ORGANIZATION>, asked <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> why he had n't been `` nearly as vocal talking about the differences between yourself and Rev. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Would that be because you do n't want to offend his black supporters?'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> replied that `` the reason is he does n't have a record to talk about in public life.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> went on to say he had disagreed with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on issues such as defense spending. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was bristling and he turned to <PERSON> Woodruff </PERSON> and said: `` That is a race-based question. ... `` I am a bona fide Democrat. I have registered more Democratic voters than anyone on this stage. I am the reason why some Democrats are on this stage, because of that work. ... My race is self-evident and my leadership is obvious.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> says it will continue to focus on asbestos hazards in schools even though an agency study estimates that the problem exists in other buildings to which the public has access. The agency on Monday sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a report calling for stepped-up research, training and enforcement on the problems of asbestos in non-school buildings, but no new regulatory requirements. `` The successful implementation of the school program should remain our first concern, and we all have much to learn from it,'' wrote <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> in his cover letter to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` I fear a major initiative in other buildings could do more harm that good.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, assistant administrator for pesticides and toxic substances, said at a news conference that the agency is hampered by limited resources. The report dealt with so-called `` friable'' asbestos, which will crumble under slight pressure and throw fibers into the air. The fibers can cause lung cancer, cancer of the lining of the chest or abdominal cavity and asbestosis. Asbestos-containing material that is damaged, such as insulated pipe wrappings and tiles, can release the fibers. The <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> should be writing regulations or seeking legislation to give those workers the right to know what they're dealing with. The union has 150,000 of its 850,000 members in building service jobs. The agency's report contained new information about a still-unreleased survey of 43 federal buildings containing friable asbestos. Despite the condition of the asbestos, the average concentration in the air of the buildings was 560 fibers per cubic yard, about 0.4 percent of the workplace concentration permitted by the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. That concentration is about 10 times the typical outdoor background level, and <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said such a difference from background could be the result of chance alone _ that the buildings might not be significantly contaminated at all. The report also contained old and new information from a 1984 <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> survey of 231 buildings, a survey designed to be representative of some 3.6 million buildings to which the public has access. Elementary and secondary schools, state and local government buildings and apartments with fewer than 10 units were excluded. The old information, reported in 1985, was that an estimated 20 percent of buildings contained friable asbestos. The new information further broke down that estimate to show that 14 percent of the buildings contain damaged friable asbestos. That category was further broken down to show that 9 percent of the buildings had seriously damaged asbestos. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said too few buildings were sampled for the figures to be precise. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said the 20 percent likely could be anywhere from 14 percent to 27 percent; the 14 percent could be anywhere from 6 percent to 22 percent; and the 9 percent could be zero to 19 percent. Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, whose pressure has helped win passage of existing asbestos-in-schools programs, said in a statement, `` Everything in this report points toward aggressive federal intervention except <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s recommendations, which amount to nothing more than sweeping this alarming problem under the rug.'' The agency has said about 35,000 school buildings, roughly 35 percent of the total, contained friable asbestos in 1984. Under new EPA regulations required by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> school districts must develop asbestos management plans, with the advice of certified experts, by October 1988 and start carrying them out in July 1989. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said the school program will cost $ 3 billion, and a comparable program for buildings to which the public has access would cost $ 51 billion.

 A bomb apparently detonated by remote control exploded today near a bus carrying military personnel, damaging the bus and nearby homes but causing no injuries, police said. The blast occurred at 6:10 a.m. in <LOCATION> Benoni </LOCATION>, about 20 miles east of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. It sent shrapnel against the bus, collapsed the ceilings of two nearby homes and shattered the windows of other houses, police said. An air force spokesman, Commandant <PERSON> Koos </PERSON> <PERSON> Smit </PERSON>, said the bus was en route to <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, with 18 army, air force and medical personnel on board. There was no claim of responsibility, and police made no accusations.

Penalties for violating various health and safety laws have remained essentially unchanged over the years, while inflation has reduced the value of the amounts involved, the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> said Monday in a report. `` Letting civil penalties be eroded by inflation operates as if there were a built-in depreciation schedule in our key health and safety statutes,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldman </PERSON> of the group <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION>, in a statement released with the study. As one example the study cited the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 retains its original penalties of $ 1,000 per violation and $ 10,000 for failure to provide a safe workplace. To keep place with inflation these would have to increase to $ 2,970 and $ 29,700, the report said.

<HEAD>SDI Officials More Confident They Can Defeat Decoy Missiles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pentagon scientists say they are more confident that they can defeat attempts to fool a missile defense by using decoy warheads following a recent Star Wars space experiment. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrahamson </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> general in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday the so-called <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 181 space experiment conducted three weeks ago had provided a `` tremendous amount of data'' that already was expanding scientific understanding of how objects look as they travel through space. That, in turn, will be crucial to devising infrared, radar, laser radar and other types of sensors that can tell the difference between a real nuclear warhead and a fake one traveling through space, <PERSON> Abrahamson </PERSON> said at a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> briefing. While months if not years of research are still ahead, `` I think all of our evidence, so far ... is that, yes, we should be able to find effective ways to discriminate'' between decoy and real warheads, he said. The three-star general also acknowledged, however, that budget cuts imposed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this year have slowed the Star Wars program by at least a year and possibly more. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had wanted to spend $ 5.2 billion on research this year, but received $ 3.5 billion.

 Three months of violence in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> have led to a fundamental change in the attitude of Palestinians, particularly the young. The new aggressiveness and self-confidence spawned by the uprising could bode ill for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s future. After two decades of Israeli rule viewed by most Arabs as harsh, unjust and capricious, residents in the territories have discovered they can to some extent move events. Their outrage, their stones and bottles, have drawn an international response. `` It is a result of 20 years of humiliating measures,'' said <PERSON> Sumeye </PERSON> <PERSON> Naser </PERSON>, a biology professor at <ORGANIZATION> Bir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. `` Now, they all feel they have nothing to lose.'' The effect is most evident among those born after the 1967 war, when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. Those young people have never known anything but Israeli occupation. At the barricades of stone and burning tires throughout the occupied lands the spearhead is the teen-ager. Youths throw stones and taunt the soldiers, daring them to retaliate. Other boys so young they ca n't possibly understand the political implications of what they are doing boldy confront tear gas and guns, stone cars, wave V-signs and outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, in the village of <LOCATION> Bir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zeit </LOCATION> west of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, a teen-ager named <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> loitered near the post office with a group of friends, waiting for something to happen. `` I hope they come,'' he said of the Israeli army. `` I would like to fight them. I'd be happy to sacrifice my life.'' He and other Palestinians interviewed declined to give their full names, saying they feared arrest for rioting or Israeli reprisals against their families. But the movement is not exclusively young. Talks with scores of Palestinians in the territories reveal an almost universal willingness to push the confrontation to the limit. `` We have to depend on ourselves to liberate our own land,'' said <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON>, an elderly man hobbling on his cane at the rear of a demonstration in the village of <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naami </LOCATION>. `` We have reached this conclusion, and I am ready to give my life.'' The killings, the beatings, the tear gas attacks, the broken bones inflicted by the Israelis in an effort to stifle the uprising have had the opposite effect, instilling a sense of defiance among Palestinians, and in some, a desire for revenge. Also evident is a new feeling of self-esteem among a people treated as second-class citizens for so long that they came to believe they were second class. By going to the barricades, by participating in the general strike, by demonstrating, they are asserting a newfound aggressiveness. And they are seeing results. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s peace mission to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> was sparked by the violence. With elections planned in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> this year, it is unlikely any peacemaking efforts would have been undertaken without the direct pressure of the mounting death toll and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> crackdown. `` They have recognized something about themselves,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Verber </PERSON>, education director of the <ORGANIZATION> Golda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a group that promotes Arab-Jewish coexistence. `` They look at themselves differently now,'' Verber said. `` They see independence from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as something solid. They feel they can do something about it. `` A year ago, this feeling did n't exist. From that point of view, it is the point of no return. We will not be able to put things back they way they were before. They have made a statement.'' For years, inhabitants of the territories have looked for leadership to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which sought to control the struggle from the outside, limiting the locals to a secondary role. The locals saw the situation as out of their hands, beyond their control. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> remains a potent force in the occupied lands. But the uprising has taught local Palestinians that they themselves can strike directly at the Israelis. They are no longer awed by the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military might that for so long cowed them into submission. `` The uprising has given us a sense of pride and a lack of fear,'' said <PERSON> Hammad </PERSON>, another <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> villager. `` We think we can control our future.'' For years, the Israelis kept Palestinians under control with a minimal force _ less than 1,000 soldiers in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, for example. Now, although authorities refuse to reveal numbers, it is said there are almost as many soldiers in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> as were needed to seize it in 1967. When the demonstrations began, they were mostly in the large towns and cities and in the refugee camps. Now, they have spread to the smallest villages. `` Nobody knows what the aftermath is going to be,'' said <PERSON> Munir </PERSON> <PERSON> Naser </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Bir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` There are darker aspects. The people who have been beaten or buried, people who have had their hands broken, will have psychological problems. `` I think they are going to wait for the first opportunity to take revenge.''

<HEAD>Dollar And Stocks Close Higher In Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Late-afternoon dollar purchases by speculators pushed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency higher in uninspired <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> trading today, while stock prices rose in unusually heavy trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, dealers said. The dollar opened at 128.45 yen, up 0.33 yen from Monday's close, following gains on overseas markets It then edged up in afternoon trading to close the day at 128.63 yen, up 0.51 yen. Spot volume totaled a moderate $ 4.7 billion. Despite the large day-to-day rise in the dollar's value, traders said there was little news that was influencing trading in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. `` The actual range in trading during the day was n't very great, only about 0.2 yen,'' said a trader at a <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> commercial bank who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` Most of the increase was due to speculators trying to cover dollar-short positions in the late afternoon.'' The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average, which ended 13 consecutive days of gains with a decline of 42.06 points Monday, rose 193.09 points, or 0.8 percent, to finish the day at 25,435.90. Stocks in many sectors rose, with trading in the market's first section an exceptionally heavy 1.6 billion shares, the highest so far this year. The second-section index also rose, gaining 1.56 points to hit an all-time high of 2,927.31. Dealers said stocks were spurred upward by a surge on Wall Street on Monday that pushed the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average up 48.41 points to 2,071.61, its highest level since last year's market crash But they said the market received additional impetus from bullishness resulting from favorable Japanese economic trends. `` Lately, the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market has been acting more independently of Wall Street,'' said <PERSON> Michio </PERSON> <PERSON> Katsumata </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest brokerage `` Stocks in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> are being buoyed by predictions of higher Japanese corporate profits in March. Also, the large amount of capital in circulation is boosting the market, resulting in an excess of buy orders over sell orders.'' The announcement today that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s unemployment rate in January rose 0.1 percent from December had little impact on the market, traders said. January's 2.7 percent rate was down from 3.0 percent for the same month last year.

<TEXT>
 The Winter Olympics on television and a drop in the number of new movies contributed to a sluggish weekend at the box office. `` Good Morning, Vietnam'' was the No. 1 film for the seventh week. `` The openings were n't strong and the Olympics did very well in the ratings, particularly on Sunday. The box office was hurt on Sunday,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Krier </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Exhibitor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which compiles the weekly turnstile figures. `` Good Morning, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' which got <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of a raucous <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> disc jockey, earned $ 5.2 million for a nine-week total of $ 78.5 million. In second place was <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Polanski </PERSON>'s `` Frantic'' with $ 4.35 million in ticket sales. It was another good week for <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION>, with three movies remaining in the Top 5. In addition to `` Good Morning, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' Disney-Touchstone films has the <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Poitier </PERSON> movie `` Shoot to Kill'' in third with a $ 3.5 million take and `` Three Men and a Baby,'' fifth in its 13th week of release. The offbeat romantic film `` Moonstruck'' was fourth with $ 3.3 million. The only other new entry in the Top 10 was `` Night in the Life of <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reardon </PERSON>,'' a teen movie starring <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. It earned $ 2.7 million in its first week, to place sixth. `` Action Jackson'' was seventh with $ 2.4 million, `` Broadcast News'' was eighth with $ 1.349 million, `` She's Having a Baby'' was ninth with $ 1.340 million and the creepy `` The Serpent and the Rainbow'' was 10th with $ 1.32 million.

<HEAD>Survey Finds Large Increase in U.S. Students Studying Abroad</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A rapidly growing number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> college students are studying abroad, especially in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, according to a new study. In 1985-86, 48,483 students took courses for academic credit in foreign schools, according to latest figures released Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest higher education exchange agency. In 1982-83, the most recent previous study, 27,145 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> students studied abroad, said <PERSON> Edrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> IIE </ORGANIZATION>'s senior publications editor. The survey was conducted by mail last year to 2,896 accredited <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> colleges and universities, of which 1,898 reported students earning academic credit for study abroad. The study did not explain the rise in popularity of foreign study. But administrators on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> college campuses said that at least som students may be finding that study overseas is economical compared with the more expensive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> schools where tuitions have been soaring throughout the 1980s. At <ORGANIZATION> Beaver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Glenside </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, a school noted for study-abroad programs that students from some 225 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> colleges participate in, president <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Landman </PERSON> said she believed the increase stemmed from `` an increasing sensitivity among students to foreign study, not only to help their careers, but especially in the last year or two, to the kinds of understandings we as world citizens must bring to our lives.'' The school is sending over 1,700 students from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> campuses to study in the British <LOCATION> Isles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> this year, <PERSON> Landman </PERSON> said, compared with about 750 students in 1980-81. At <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where the numbers of students in overseas programs have risen at least 10 percent in that period, <PERSON> Orville </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, assistant dean of international programs said that as more students have traveled during their high school years, the thought of studying overseas is no longer as strange or frightening. The survey found that 76.8 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> students abroad were studying in Western European countries. The most popular single country, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, attracted 29.3 percent of all students studying abroad, followed by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> with 13.7 percent, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> with 8.8 percent, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> 7.8 percent, and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> 6.1 percent. <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> attracted 7 percent, with smaller percentages studying in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Nearly 90 percent of the students were in programs sponsored by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> colleges and universities, the survey found. The most popular field of study was liberal arts, with 18.2 percent, followed by foreign language with 16.7 percent. Almost two-thirds, or 63.8 percent, of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> students abroad were female, according to the report.

<HEAD>Park West High: A Challenge for New Schools Chancellor</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Park West High School, where book bags have been known to contain machetes and switchblades, is the kind of school that prompted the city's new chancellor to declare that public education is on trial here. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> school superintendent who begins work today as head of the nation's largest school system, soon will have an invitation to see Park West for himself. Senior class officers want him to speak at graduation, and their letter asks, `` Why would a chancellor want to link himself to the so-called ` worst school in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'?'' Their answer: `` To send a signal to the media and to the public that <PERSON> Park </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON> is a school worthy of respect.'' The 10-year-old, fortress-like concrete structure in the section once known as <PERSON> Hell </PERSON>'s Kitchen lost most claims to respectability five weeks ago, when a state <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> team suspended a routine inspection. The reviewers said administrators were unable to provide them with basic records for test scores, attendance and promotions. They also cited `` chaotic'' conditions, including the stabbing of a student just outside the building _ the second in as many days. `` The school was overrun by groups of students, split along racial lines, at battle with each other,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>, a department spokesman. In a gym class, students `` were just running around with no easily identifiable teacher or sign of organized activity.'' Under a new, interim principal, conditions have improved. Security has been tightened, enrollment limited, tutoring increased and student activities added. Twelve teachers patrol the school's hallways at a time, and students must display their schedule card at the door before they are allowed to leave early. Visitors must provide identification, sign in and sign out. Even so, almost a third of the 2,500 students are absent each day, and half of those who do come are late. More than half fail at least one subject. So many drop out that seniors account for only 7 percent of the enrollment. Some students stay home out of fear of gangs outside the school, and dozens more have transferred, including the nephew of the parents' association vice president. `` He was failing two classes because he was leaving early to avoid the scene at the end of the school day,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe-Tabman </PERSON>. `` Kids say they will not wear nice clothes to school because they'll be stolen.'' Some teachers told a reporter for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> they believed a majority of students carry weapons. A veteran guidance counselor said some parents encourage children to carry them for protection. Although the vast majority of teachers and administrators are white, Principal <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Petruzillo </PERSON> says she knows of only one white student. Relations have been tense between some groups of black, Puerto Rican, Dominican and Haitian students. The school's problems began to surface in December, when a group of Hispanic bilingual education students staged a sit-in to protest attacks. Asked at that time about violence, <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said, `` Kids have been bringing weapons to school for years. It's almost a habit.'' A month later, after a study by a <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> team, the 66-year-old <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> requested reassignment. Some students feel Park West is not that bad. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>, a college-bound senior, said the high schools his brothers attended make Park West sound tame. `` It's a city high school,'' he shrugged. Park West's problems are not unique in a system of 936,000 students, between a third and half of whom drop out before graduation. In the 1986-87 school year, more than 9,700 violent incidents were reported, about 3,500 of them `` serious,'' such as assaults and robberies. The state plans to resume its review of Park West. If conditions have not improved, <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> said, administrators will be told that `` if they do n't clean up their act, the school will be closed down.'' After being named chancellor in January, <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said he rejected the idea that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s schools are `` failed institutions,'' but said `` public education is on trial'' here. He faces a system full of emerging or potential Park Wests. But solutions, says Petruzillo, can not be uniformly imposed from <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> headquarters `` because each school is different. You ca n't replicate a success in one school at another.'' At least, she said, `` Dr. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> is coming to a city that is ready for change. He's going to have a very interesting time.''

<HEAD>Tensions Simmer Anew At Dartmouth Over Conservative Paper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HANOVER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Members of <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>'s Afro-American Society planned more protests this week after a black professor came under renewed attack from a conservative student newspaper The dispute between The <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> and music Professor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> threatened to reignite tensions that shattered the <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> campus after a January 1986 sledgehammer attack by Review members on anti-apartheid shanties on the college green. The independent weekly's editor, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>, who also was involved in the shanty attack, faces college disciplinary charges with three other Review members stemming from a confrontation with <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> last week after the paper printed a cover story questioning his competence. Cole had sued the newspaper for libel for a January 1983 article that said he `` looks like a used Brillo pad'' and called his music course `` the most outrageous'' on campus. Cole dropped the suit in 1985 and received no damages. He and the newspaper each claimed vindication. A member of the <ORGANIZATION> Afro-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, sophomore <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, said Monday the newspaper's new attacks were `` obviously racially motivated.'' About 250 students held a rally Monday in front of the college administration building, and <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said the Afro-American Society planned to start a boycott today of <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION> businesses that advertise in the Review. The group also planned a march down <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Fraternity Row'' Wednesday night and a rally with students from other area colleges Thursday. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said members of Afro-American Society also met twice Monday with <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON> to detail allegations of other recent racial incidents on campus. In its cover story two weeks ago, the Review revived charges that <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> is incompetent and printed excerpts from a transcript of one of his classes that week. The story also leveled criticisms at an English professor who is white. <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> said both stories originated from complaints to the newspaper by students in the classes. <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> denied the article was racially motivated and said the Review is the victim of a `` witch hunt'' as it tries to root out incompetence at <LOCATION> Dartmouth </LOCATION>. He said he and two Review colleagues, with a fourth as an observer, approached <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> after his class Thursday to advise him that he could publish an unedited response in the newspaper, but also to seek his explanation for remarks about the Review he allegedly made during a class. <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> said an `` altercation'' ensued. The next day, the Review published on its cover a picture of Cole during the incident and a story about it. <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Huppe </PERSON> said <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> and the other three students face college charges of disorderly conduct, harassment and violation of the right to privacy because of the confrontation. `` To have four students exercise their will over the institution, we're not going to let four students do that,'' said <PERSON> Huppe </PERSON>. The four are scheduled to appear before a disciplinary board next Tuesday. Cole could not be reached for comment. He did not return a message left on his telephone answering machine Monday night. <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> was among a dozen students involved in a pre-dawn sledgehammer attack on symbolic anti-apartheid shanties set up by student protesters in January 1986. After a series of hearings and appeals, he was sentenced to serve 180 hours of community service. The shanty attack sparked sit-ins and protests that continued all semester and led to a one-day moratorium on classes for discussions of racism.

<HEAD>National Association Drug Committee Chief Says War on Drugs
Failing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA MYERS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's war on drugs has been little more than a skirmish that failed to stem the movement of drugs across <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> borders, says the head of a task force of prosecutors. `` The federal government, despite all the talk, has failed to stop the drug trafficking across the borders,'' State's Attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attorney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s annual conference Monday `` And it's increasing each year. It's not going down.'' <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, head of the association's <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> border patrols capture only 15 percent of the illegal drugs coming into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, while marijuana and cocaine worth $ 130 billion a year is entering from Latin American countries. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> also said the federal government is not properly funding local efforts to prosecute criminals as promised when the war on drugs was declared. `` I do n't think it's a war on drugs. I think it's only been skirmishes,'' <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> said. `` They do n't really have a national policy. That's where it fails.'' When the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration first attacked drug use in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, it set aside $ 225 million to help local prosecutors, who handle at least 95 percent of the drug cases in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> said. But this year funding was cut to $ 70 million, although the drug problem is getting worse and more violent, he said. `` The federal government should put its money where its mouth is,'' said <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, the son of the late <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>. `` We local prosecutors are on the offensive and we need federal help. `` The drug people are going to corrupt this country more and more. And you're going to see more violence. You're just seeing the beginning.'' The association delegates approved four resolutions dealing with drug enforcement, including one urging federal funding for local anti-drug programs to be reinstated to `` adequate levels.'' They called for combining state and federal efforts to block the importation of illegal drugs into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A third resolution asked the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to channel its efforts toward helping `` prevent drug dealers from enjoying the profits of their illegal activity.'' The association also asked for a federal program to help fund the construction of county and state prisons to house the increased number of convicted drug offenders. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> said the idea of educating the public to `` just say no'' has gone far enough and the concentration should be placed on people who have said yes to drugs for years. `` I'm not a social worker and I'm not a teacher,'' <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> said. `` I'm a prosecutor.''

 <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>, the duke and duchess of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, transformed into <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fergie </PERSON>, the down-home celebrities, snacking at a supermarket deli, decorating a cake and shaking hands with screaming fans. The royal couple's `` walkabout'' along the edge of a crowd outside a supermarket Monday was their closest unplanned contact with everyday Americans during a <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> tour that has included much hobnobbing with <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> celebrities. `` I love them both. I think <PERSON> Fergie </PERSON> and Di are just _ American,'' said <PERSON> Susie </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON>, referring also to <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>, the Princess of <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON>, 27, visiting from <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, waited for two hours in on-and-off rain that could have been imported from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for the royal retinue to arrive at the Von's Pavilions market in suburban <LOCATION> Arcadia </LOCATION>. Prince <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> and his pregnant wife, midway through their 10-day tour, plan to meet with British denizens of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> today during a new round of stops that includes a trip to a trendy disco. They have already been greeted by famous faces like <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> fame; <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, the wicked queen of the `` Dynasty'' dynasty; and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> York </PERSON>, a movie actor who lately has appeared on `` Knots Landing.'' York, who greeted the royal pair during their travels Monday, said that the duke and duchess have a glamour of their own. `` They have a youth, glamour and pizazz and they preserve a longstanding tradition,'' he said. Today, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> were to take a tour of <ORGANIZATION> Showscan </ORGANIZATION>, a movie special effects studio in suburban <LOCATION> Culver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Later, they planned to meet with British Oscar winners at the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. Finishing out their round of entertaining the entertainment community, they were to attend a lunch for the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>. Two fashion shows were laid on to finish the royal day, one at the Music Center, and another at the Stock Exchange disco downtown. The royal couple is in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to promote trade to <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and act as patrons of the three-month UK-LA'88 festival, a celebration of the British arts in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. On Monday, apart from the supermarket, the couple visited a technology museum and the <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bullocks </ORGANIZATION> department store, where they were joined by a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> entourage that included <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Peppard </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bridges </ORGANIZATION>. At the supermarket, the duchess cruised the aisles and paid particular attention to the deli section, pausing to examine sushi and stuffed chicken breasts but tasting only one item _ a dollop of coffee-toffee chip ice cream. `` She said she loved the pastry but was afraid to eat it,'' confided assistant bakery manager <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Huereque </PERSON>, who recognized a sister calorie-counter. Both the duchess and duke tried their hand at decorating a cake. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> produced a vague approximation of a red rose and she made a lopsided white rose, symbol of the house of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> posted gains in early trading today, in line with rises in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 13.3 points, or 0.75 percent, at 1782.1 by midmorning. The index opened at 1781.1, up 12.2 points from Monday's close. Brokers said prices increased across the board before the official opening, but profit-takers emerged to erase some gains. In contrast to the general rise, shares for retail stores were largely unchanged because of growing caution about the prospect for major tax cuts in the government's March 15 budget statement. The early trend followed sharp gains in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Monday, where the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average rose 48.41 to 2,071.41, and a rise overnight in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> index climbed 193.09 to 25,435.90.

<HEAD>Blast Kills Two IRA Men; IRA Reportedly Supplied With SAM Missiles</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Police said two <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas killed in a huge explosion in a border area may have been installing explosives in a van in preparation for an attack on an army observation post. The blast, which occurred Monday in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armagh </LOCATION> border area, destroyed a van and a barn about two miles outside <LOCATION> Crossmaglen </LOCATION> village, badly damaged two cars and left a crater in the ground. In another development, Irish and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> authorities on Monday said <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> has sent Soviet-made, anti-aircraft missiles to the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. Police said four armed and masked men hijacked the van and a car shortly before the blast, which the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> called an accident. Authorities speculated that <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas were installing explosives in the van when the explosives accidentally detonated. A police officer, speaking anonymously in keeping with British practice, said the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s intended target probably was an army observation post near the border with <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. The mostly Roman Catholic IRA often uses explosives in its violent campaign to drive the British out of the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> province and unite it with the overwhelmingly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement Monday saying two of its men died in the blast, which it described as `` an unfortunate accident.'' The group gave no details, and said names and <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> ranks of the dead men would be released after families are notified. The British domestic news agency <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said the two dead men had been named locally as <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Moley </PERSON>. Irish and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> authorities said in a TV program broadcast from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Monday that the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is equipped with Soviet-made SAM-7 anti-aircraft missiles. The surface-to-air missiles were contained in more than 100 tons of weaponry sent by <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> in four shiploads in 1985 and 1986, according to the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Panorama'' program The program said British army helicopters operating along <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s border with the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> would be the most likely targets. The Irish justice minister, <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, said some of the missiles `` may very well be'' in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> already. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hermon </PERSON>, chief constable of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s police force, said he had `` no reason to doubt'' the SAM-7s are hidden somewhere in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Officials said one shipment in October was unloaded one night at an isolated jetty near <LOCATION> Arklow </LOCATION>, 40 miles south of <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Police have uncovered some of the weapons recently in both the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, but no SAM-7s have been found.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> is prepared to back a Central American plan to boost economic development in the troubled region, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s foreign minister said. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said Monday the 12-member <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> `` is prepared to take constructive part in seeing this plan through.'' <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, who was chairing the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> session, did not say by how much the community was prepared to raise its relatively small amount of economic aid to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, but emphasized the group was interested in helping the region achieve stability. EEC aid to the region last year was about $ 96 million, community officials said. The Central American states have worked out a $ 1.4 billion total aid package they say is needed from foreign doners. Earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> reaffirmed its support for a regional peace plan and warned against outside interference in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The peace plan calls for an end to outside support for insurgencies, cease-fires, amnesties and democratic reforms. French Foreign Minister <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheysson </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> commission </ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> relations, also reassured Central American countries of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s economic support without providing specific figures. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers were in <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> for a one-day meeting that centered on Central American issues. They met with representatives of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> _ the countries whose presidents signed the <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> peace plan in August.

<TEXT>
 A respected linguist who says he was enticed by <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the 1970s says he is going broke on a school pension after being forced to retire two years ago. <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaumyan </PERSON>, a 72-year-old professor emeritus of linguistics, said Monday he never would have emigrated had he known he faced mandatory retirement on a $ 750-a-month pension 11 years later. `` I lived quite well -LRB- in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> -RRB- and here I do n't know what to do. I am without means to live,'' he said. `` I think it's very strange why a university professor must retire at 70. Now I do even better work than before.'' <PERSON> Shaumyan </PERSON>, who became an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizen in 1980, said he is happy with his new country, but he is considering a lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>. His lawyer wants <PERSON> Shaumyan </PERSON>'s pension doubled to $ 1,500 a month. `` <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> is un-American,'' <PERSON> Shaumyan </PERSON> said. `` If I knew that I would jeopardize my work, my family, my existence, I would n't have left <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> wooed him from established academic positions in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1975 without telling him he would be automatically retired at the age of 70, as are all faculty members. `` They promised me a good position and prominent work,'' he said. `` They deceived me.'' University spokesman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Littell </PERSON> declined to comment because of the possibility of a lawsuit. <PERSON> Shaumyan </PERSON> said he was paid $ 20,000 during 1975, his first year at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>, and was making nearly $ 55,000 by the time he retired in 1986. Now, he said, he has depleted his savings and is going broke, even with the $ 900 he receives in monthly Social Security benefits. Mortgage, car and student loan payments for his three children eat up $ 1,100 a month, he said. `` He's not asking for a large sum and he's not asking to hit the lottery here,'' said his lawyer, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Arons </PERSON>. Shaumyan is a specialist in mathematical linguistics. In his 1987 book, `` A Semiotic Theory of Language'' published by <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, he discusses how mathematics can set uniform rules for languages, which in turn have applications for writing new computer languages. His 11 books have been translated into at least seven languages.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> appealed today to communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to take part in the 1988 Olympic Games and pledged not to impose any conditions on the north's participation. `` There is no condition. ... We will welcome you, the breathren in the north, more than anyone else as the same countrymen and brothers,'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> told an audience of 4,000 people at the Sejong cultural center in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> made the strongest appeal in recent months to the north to take part in the Games, speaking during celebrations of Samil Day, a national holiday commemorating a 1919 uprising against Japanese rule. He also appealed for national reconciliation in the south. `` Today, we recall our breathren ... who rose up with bare fists against the Japanese imperialist colonial rule,'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said. Less than one mile away, police today kicked and punched dissidents and dragged away dozens of them after breaking up an anti-government protest in <LOCATION> Pagoda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, where the 1919 uprising took place. Prominent dissident leaders were among those detained. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> hinted at his willingness to meet with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> leaders by saying he was ready to deal with anybody. He repeated that the south would seek to establish relations with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s main allies, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` I will meet with anyone, anytime and anywhere and will not hesitate to open that road however rugged it might be,'' he said. The new president, formally sworn in Feb. 25, said the Olympic Games could help speed reunification of the divided <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is demanding to co-host the Olympic Games and says it will boycott the Games if its request is denied. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> have rejected the demand, but said the north could stage five events if it takes part in the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> events. The two nations have existed since 1948 and fought the bloody Korean War from 1950 to 1953. The bitter rivals have clashed repeatedly over the years. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> also appealed to the South Korean opposition to work with his government in ending decades of authoritarian rule and introducing full democracy. `` The curtain has been raised for the era of national self-esteem in which democracy will blossom,'' he said. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, a former general, won the first democratic presidential elections in 16 years last December with 36.6 percent of the vote after rival opposition candidates split the opposition vote. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> campaigned on the platform that he alone could ensure democracy and stability. About 150 dissidents staged a demonstration today in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s Pagoda Park to denounce <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> and demand the immediate release of all political prisoners Protesters waved placards, shouted slogans and applauded speeches as hundreds of onlookers watched. `` Down with the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government!'' and `` Release all the political prisoners!,'' the protesters shouted. Scuffles began when plainclothes police tried to detain some protesters and other dissidents protested. A column of about 100 police suddenly charged into the protest, kicking and punching people to the ground and chasing others. Police hauled away about 40 dissidents, some of whom were badly beaten. Police also hit a number of press photographers covering the demonstration. The Rev. Moon Ikhwan and several other prominent dissident leaders were taken away by police. Some of those detained included radicals released from prison Saturday as part of a government amnesty. Opposition leaders rejected the amnesty as insufficient and have demanded the release of all political prisoners. The government says only dissidents guilty of violent crime or subversion remain in jail.

 County commissioners have approved a $ 2.3 million contract to construct an elevator tower and visitors center in the former <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schoolbook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depository </ORGANIZATION> as part of an exhibit on the assassination of President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. The commissioners voted 3-2 Monday to award the contract to <ORGANIZATION> Thomas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hayman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which will begin work on the project as early as this week. `` The eyes of the world will be on this project,'' said <PERSON> Lindalyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which has worked for 11 years to get the exhibit funded. `` As sad as it is, it is the most important historical site in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>.'' The foundation plans to raise $ 1.5 million from private sources for additional renovations on the sixth floor of what is now known as the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Administration Building. The <ORGANIZATION> Warren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> determined that <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> fired a high-powered rifle at Kennedy from the sixth floor of the building where he worked on Nov. 22, 1963. The elevator tower is intended to carry up to 500,000 visitors a year to the exhibit without disrupting work at county government offices. Architect <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Callaway </PERSON> said construction could be completed by November, but foundation officials say they are unlikely to schedule the exhibit's opening on Nov. 22, the 25th anniversary of <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s assassination. `` We think it would be inappropriate,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Afghan Envoy Accuses Pakistan Of Undermining Peace Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is trying to undermine U.N.-sponsored <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> peace talks, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> charged today. The ambassador, <PERSON> Mohamadulah </PERSON> <PERSON> Subhani </PERSON> <PERSON> Safi </PERSON>, made the comment on the eve of a new round of negotiations, telling a news conference that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> `` does n't want peace'' for its Afghan neighbors. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which represents the Afghan guerrillas in the talks that resume in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on Wednesday, is trying to `` raise issues that have no relevance to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>,'' he charged. <PERSON> Safi </PERSON> complained about <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s demand that any accord signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> that would facilitate a withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> be linked to the formation of a transitional, coalition government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Without such an interim government, unending civil strife would follow a Soviet pullout, Pakistani diplomats have argued. But <PERSON> Safi </PERSON> said the composition of the Afghan government can not be dictated by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> or any outside power. His comments were echoed in an article in Pravda, the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily, which said <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> leaders have `` apparently forgotten their previous statements that the presence of the Soviet troops in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> was the sole obstacle in the way toward resolving the Afghan problem.'' Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has pledged _ if peace talks are successful _ to begin withdrawing an estimated 115,000 troops from its embattled neighbor May 15 and complete the pullout in 10 months. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has said the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has no intention of trying to determine the composition of the government left behind when it leaves the country it entered in December 1979 in support of a Marxist regime. Pravda called it `` an open secret'' that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies have a decisive influence over <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and leaders of the Afghan resistance. `` Their attitude to the Afghan settlement, which is now entering its crucial stage,'' will be a touchstone for the world to judge the real worth of their calls for a political settlement of regional crises of every kind,'' the newspaper said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been ambivalent in its reaction to the calls for an interim government. A senior American official returning with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> hinted last week that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> does not back such demands. But the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, in a non-binding resolution Monday, urged the formation of an interim government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> that would be acceptable to the Afghan resistance. There also has been a lack of clear signals on when <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> would be prepared to cut off its aid to the guerrillas, which was reported to have totaled about $ 700 million last year.

<HEAD>$50 Million In Funds For Poor Embezzled, Misappropriated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Local officials pocketed or misappropriated $ 48 million in state funds to poverty-stricken areas over two years, using the money to build hotels, apartments and movie houses, an official report said. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auditing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said the sum represents 6 percent of the $ 816 million it audited, but officials said they believe much more was embezzled during 1985 and 1986, the official <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. The state allocated more than $ 1.62 billion to poverty-stricken areas in the two-year period, the paper said. Statistics at the end of 1986 showed that 60 million people in about 200 counties live below <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s poverty line of $ 40 annually plus 440 pounds of grain. Auditors also found more than 110 people involved in graft cases totaling more than $ 91,000, it said. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> is planning to change distribution of the funds so that the money will go directly to enterprises that can improve the area's financial situation. In <LOCATION> Yanchi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ningxia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Autonomous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Region </ORGANIZATION>, more than $ 243,000 or 42.9 percent of the county's funds for the poor, were used to build apartments, hotels and cinemas, the paper said. In seven cities and counties in <LOCATION> Hunan </LOCATION>, officials used $ 132,432 to buy 22 cars and other motor vehicles. In <LOCATION> Feixian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Shandong </LOCATION> province, officials used $ 4,300, collected illegally as administrative fees for the distribution of the help-the-poor funds, to buy motorcycles, tape recorders and cameras, the paper said.

 <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s fourth-grade science students are saying `` rats'' to junk food after a month of experiments in which they compared school-food and junk-food diets by feeding them to rodents. `` It seems like children sort of know what they're suppose to be eating but you're wondering if it has any impact,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. `` With the kids doing this, they notice the difference.'' On Monday, a pair of rats named Sweetie and <PERSON> Boss </PERSON> <PERSON> Hog </PERSON> munched on french fries and a candy bar while fellow rodents Rascal and <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> dined on a <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> lunch consisting of salad, asparagus and a hamburger casserole.

Ms. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, who has taught the six-week rat lesson on nutrition eight other times, said she watches for signs the rats are becoming too ill and switches their diets if necessary.

 The government's new policy of glasnost will suffer if theaters are barred from performing a play criticized for its portrayal of Soviet history, eight leading theater figures said. The Soviet people have gotten glasnost through suffering and `` that's why any attempts to turn the process backwards ... arouse deepest concern,'' said the three actors, three producers and two playwrights in a letter published Monday in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, or more openness on some issues, has led to greater artistic freedom. Lately, Soviet artists have produced plays on subjects they would not have touched before. The eight accused several critics of trying to block the staging of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Shatrov </PERSON>'s play `` Onward _ Onward _ Onward'' by `` pinning political labels'' on its author. Earlier this month, three historians told Pravda the play compared Soviet founder <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> to <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> _ denounced after his death as a dictator _ and portrayed Soviet history in a negative way. The eight said the timing of the criticism indicated it was aimed at dissuading theaters from booking the play. `` It is not by chance that in the provinces they manage to hear this voice. We have information at the Union of Theater Workers that this new play, devoted to <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>, already was banned in some towns,'' the eight wrote. <PERSON> Shatrov </PERSON>'s new work takes the form of a debate among Bolsheviks and their opponents as they look back on Soviet history since the 1917 revolution that brought the Communists to power. The historians accused <PERSON> Shatrov </PERSON> of using <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> as a conduit for his own ideas and treating the Bolshevik revolution as an accident. In their letter, the eight said <PERSON> Shatrov </PERSON> has written about <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> for 30 years and his plays have been well received. <PERSON> Shatrov </PERSON>'s new play was published in January in the literary magazine <LOCATION> Znamya </LOCATION> and is scheduled to be performed in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> this spring. In the play, <PERSON> Shatrov </PERSON> makes <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> answer for his purges in which millions of people perished, but in one scene <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> accepts blame for not making certain <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> could not gain power after <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s death in 1924 In the closing scene, <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> are on stage. The desire is expressed for <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> to leave, but he will not. `` Yes, we do want <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> to leave, not only the stage, but our lives,'' the eight said in the letter. `` We want his methods to vanish, his ` morality,' his ways to solve disputes, in particular in art. But unfortunately, the heritage of the past can not be overcome by pronouncements.'' `` We are not going to defend the play or attack it,'' they added. `` It has n't been staged yet and a play without being staged is a soul without a body. We are concerned with other things.'' In a seven-paragraph comment on the letter, <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said it would not take sides. `` Pravda's point of view is well known,'' it said. `` It has always been against anybody's monopoly for truth and against the position ` There is my opinion and there is a wrong opinion'.''

<TEXT>
 An American denied a first-class honors degree from <ORGANIZATION> Bristol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> after he was accused of cheating petitioned <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, saying he's honest and is not getting a fair appeal hearing. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Foecke </PERSON>, 30, a native of South Bend, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, has spent the last 21 months trying to clear his name after writing his final exams in mathematics and computer science at the school in the western city of <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> in June 1986. The <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said today that he and his English wife, <PERSON> Priscilla </PERSON>, have spent $ 53,100 trying to disprove allegations that he illicitly gained access to examination papers before the examination. `` I do not think I am ever going to get an objective hearing or an objective decision from the -LRB- university's -RRB- appeal committee because they are so close to the people who say I am guilty,'' said <PERSON> Foecke </PERSON>. `` I do not think they realize what a devastating effect this has had on my wife and me,'' he said. The couple lives in the <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> suburb of <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON>. When <PERSON> Foecke </PERSON> went to pick up his results after the final exams, the university registrar told him he was suspected of cheating and would not receive the degree, the highest the university offers. He was told his examination answers too closely mirrored the lecturers' model answers and that he even had repeated their mistakes in working out some of the mathematical equations. <PERSON> Foecke </PERSON> has maintained he worked up to 18 hours a day for more than a year preparing for the exams and that he used the methods taught by his lecturers. The Times said the university authorities did not prove <PERSON> Foecke </PERSON> cheated but stated they believe he may have stolen a key to get into an office where the papers were stored. <PERSON> Foecke </PERSON>'s lawyer <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorman </PERSON> said Monday: `` We are petitioning -LRB- the queen -RRB- on the grounds of a breach of natural justice.'' A legal concept enforced by the senior courts, natural justice says any group making an official ruling, such as the university authorities, must give a fair hearing to the person involved before announcing its decision. The queen holds the post of visitor at the university. The visitor is appointed to look after student interests among other matters but petitions to her in this capacity are rare. Because she is a constitutional monarch, the queen would not make a ruling in her own right in <PERSON> Foecke </PERSON>'s case and there was no comment on the case from Buckingham Palace. The petition was sent through <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Belstead </PERSON>, who holds the post of Lord President of the <ORGANIZATION> Privy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and is the Cabinet member responsible for supervising the government's legislative program.

 Cartoonist <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Caniff </PERSON>, creator of the Steve Canyon and <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Pirates </ORGANIZATION> comic strips, has begun chemotherapy treatments for lung cancer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Caniff </PERSON> was in the mood to talk Monday in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Beth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> hospital. `` First thing this morning I reached for the old drawing board but it was n't even there,'' <PERSON> Caniff </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Caniff </PERSON>, who learned about the cancer Friday, thinks it will be at least a month before he is able to draw <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Canyon </PERSON> again. He said he does n't know how long he will be in the hospital. `` This cancer thing has kind of stopped me in my tracks for a bit, so right now I'm just taking it one day at a time,'' he said. <PERSON> Caniff </PERSON> said he has about 30 days worth of the Canyon strip finished. If he's unable to work when those are gone, his assistant, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON>, and others will keep the storyline running. <PERSON> Caniff </PERSON>, who grew up in <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, has been producing a daily comic strip for 54 years and had planned to continue drawing in the hospital. `` But when it came right down to it, I did n't feel like it,'' the 81-year-old artist said. Even so, he said, his spirits are high. `` I'm just naturally ornery, anyway, but when this happened, I had to decide what I was going to do,'' he said. `` I could be an old curmudgeon or I could make life easier for my family, friends and the medical staff here. I decided on the latter approach.''

 A gang of bumbling burglars dressed up as Japanese Ninja warriors has botched most of its heists so far, managing to burn up $ 7,000 while trying to open safes with a blowtorch. But police say the group of three or four people is getting better with practice, and last weekend their fifth known job resulted in about $ 500 in unsinged cash for the thieves. The gang members dress in black like the Ninja, a feudal Japanese society of mercenary assassins, and enter buildings through a roof or by forcing employees working odd hours to let them in. `` They started out like they've been watching too many movies,'' joked Detective <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Berendsen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Concord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. He said in three of the burglaries, the gang's blowtorches burned up most of the cash they were after. The gang's first known burglary was of <PERSON> Emil </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlla </PERSON>'s restaurant in <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION> on Jan. 25. They gave up trying to break into a safe when their drill bit broke off in the lock.

 Rhythm-and-blues musician <PERSON> Ike </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, former husband of pop superstar <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, surrendered Monday on a week-old warrant that sought his arrest because he failed to appear in court to face cocaine charges. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, 55, was charged with possession of cocaine, conspiracy to sell cocaine and maintaining a residence for the purpose of selling cocaine. He appeared before <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Alston </PERSON> and was released after posting $ 15,000 bail. Pre-trial motions for <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> and co-defendant <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> are set March 18. Two other co-defendants return March 18 for sentencing on conspiracy charges. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> was arrested in June 1985, after he allegedly tried to sell $ 16,000 worth of cocaine to an undercover officer in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. A trial is sheduled on another charge March 14 in <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on separate felony drug-trafficking charges that include alleged transport of cocaine and possession of rock cocaine for sale. Those charges stem from an August 1987, incident in which <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's deputies stopped <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> after the car he was in allegedly was seen moving erratically. In October 1986, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> admitted he had used cocaine every day for at least 15 years and said he was undergoing rehabilitation. Turner formed the <PERSON> Ike </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> <PERSON> Revue </PERSON> with his wife, and they produced hits such as `` Proud Mary'' before splitting up in 1976. Miss Turner went on to record the 1985 Grammy-Award winning record and song of the year, `` What's Love Got to Do With It.'' Her `` Private Dancer'' album garnered two other Grammys.

<TEXT>
 While serving in the German army, <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> forwarded a request for the mass deportation of Greek civilians to labor camps in 1943, according to a Nazi document. The authenticity of the document, found in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> and made public Monday, was confirmed by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>. He said it was among the crucial documents on which the government based its decision to place <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, now <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s president and formerly <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general, on a list barring him from entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Under the Nuremberg Charter adopted at the end of the war, deportation of civilians is both a war crime and a crime against humanity. When the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> barred <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, it said he had `` assisted or otherwise participated'' in `` mass deportation of civilians.'' <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> has repeatedly declared he is innocent of any war crimes. The document is a message between German army officers in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION> in World War II and indicates the information was received by radio by <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, who signed its transcription and forwarded it on Aug. 15, 1943. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> at that time was a lieutenant serving as deputy operations officer of the German General Staff attached to the 11th Italian Army in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. The communication from a German army field officer was addressed to his headquarters and said there is `` hope of success only if all male civilians are seized and deported'' in the area in northern <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> where his division was operating. It also said `` cleansing operations are deemed necessary.'' Nazi `` cleansing operations'' often meant the destruction of towns and deportation or execution of their inhabitants. The captured <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> document was made available to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by the World Jewish Congress in the original German text, with excerpts in English. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources concurred in the translation. <PERSON> Gerold </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s spokesman, said today he had no comment on the document. The document apparently has been used before, according to <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Messerschmidt </PERSON>, a West German historian who was a member of an international commission that investigated <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s World War II past. The historians' commission and a White Book published last year by <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s aides both reviewed what seems to be the same document, <PERSON> Messerschmidt </PERSON> said. The commission's report, released Feb. 9, contradicts the White Book, saying <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s initials on the Aug. 15, 1943 document indicate he must have known about persecutions of civilians in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. The White Book says <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s initials signify `` nothing but his certifying the correctness of a copy of the message for inclusion'' in the official war diary of his unit. The World Jewish <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> did not authorize the deportation of the Greeks to labor camps in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> but that he was aware of the plan. It also said a deportation order later was countermanded by an Italian commander whom the congress did not identify. The historians' commission appointed by the Austrian government reported last month that <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was `` in close proximity'' to Nazi atrocities in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION>, knew they were going on and made no attempt to prevent them. The report did not support allegations made by various groups, including the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, that <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was involved in war crimes. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, who has rejected calls for his resignation from the presidency, said the report vindicated him. The Austrian government has protested that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> did not disclose the documents on which it based its decision to bar <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> from entry. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> responded by saying its investigation was based on documents available to <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> and he could appeal the decision. He has not done so. The executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Elan </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, said the document signed by <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was located by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 and turned over to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Reporters asked why the document was not made public until Monday. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said there is now increasing interest in why <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was placed on a list barring him from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He did not elaborate.

 Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and two other figures in the Iran-Contra affair were ordered to testify at a federal trial about an alleged scheme to smuggle marijuana and cocaine into <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The defense lawyer who obtained the subpoenas said North might be able to provide information about a pilot who flew supplies to Nicaraguan rebels under contract with the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and also was accused of transporting the drugs. North, the former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide fired in November 1986 as the Iran-Contra affair transpired, last week was ordered to appear March 15 before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Diggs </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. Defense attorney <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dresnick </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> said he wanted to determine <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s relationship with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>. According to the indictment of <PERSON> Dresnick </PERSON>'s client and seven other defendants, <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> was aboard a DC-6 aircraft allegedly used to ship drugs into <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> last summer. <PERSON> Dresnick </PERSON> represents <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Turek </PERSON> <PERSON> Correa </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, one of eight defendants indicted Sept. 24 on charges of conspiring to import tons of cocaine and marijuana into <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> between July and Sept. 6, 1987. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>, referring to <PERSON> Dresnick </PERSON>'s claim that <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> was a contract employee of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, said the defense was a diversion and `` a red herring.'' <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> was a vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION>, a CIA-backed operation, <PERSON> Dresnick </PERSON> said. According to court documents, <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> contracted with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to fly food and clothing to the Contra rebels trying to topple the government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> never was charged in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> case despite his apparent role in the alleged trafficking. <PERSON> Dresnick </PERSON>, in his court filing seeking <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s testimony, provided a page from <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s desk calendar dated Aug. 9, 1985, with a hand-written notation reading: `` DC-6, which is being used -LRB- for Contra supply -RRB- runs out of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, is probably being used for drug runs into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>'' The same calendar page also noted a `` meeting with <PERSON> Rob </PERSON>,'' who <PERSON> Dresnick </PERSON> said he believed was <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s liaison with the Contras. Both <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> also have been subpoenaed to testify in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, although <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>'s whereabouts are unknown. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney representing <PERSON> North </PERSON>, refused to say Monday night whether <PERSON> North </PERSON> had received the subpoena or to answer any other questions.

 After a month of preparation, it took only 17 minutes to roll over an upside-down oil barge that had been raised from the bottom of <LOCATION> Guemes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Channel </LOCATION> and partially unloaded. A floating sheen of oil reached the shore of <LOCATION> Shannon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> before and during the rollover Monday in a release estimated at 300 gallons to 500 gallons of a light grade of oil. Much of it was sopped up with absorbent materials. `` I'm relieved, because it eliminates an ecological time bomb,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Eldo </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLong </PERSON>. The 176-foot barge sank Jan. 31 in 130 feet of water four miles west of <LOCATION> Anacortes </LOCATION>. It was raised from the bottom Sunday by two giant derricks. The site is about 75 miles north of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s inner coast in an area of Dungeness crabs, salmon farms, bottom fish and other saltwater life Officials had said that 70,000 gallons of oil escaped from the barge when it sank, and another 344,000 gallons was still on the barge when the lifting operation began Sunday. Roughly 92,610 gallons of oil was pumped out Sunday night and Monday. More oil was to be pumped out of the barge until it was stable enough to be towed to port. Some oil has been detected in kelp beds and in bottom-dwelling sea cucumbers, and at least one bird has died. The barge, operated by Olympic Tug and <ORGANIZATION> Barge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, was being towed from an oil refinery at <LOCATION> Anacortes </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> when it sank.

 A police officer who was shot to death while he guarded a witness in a drug case was given a farewell by 10,000 police officers amid vows to find his killer and hopes that his death helps the fight against drug dealers. The throng of officers, some from as far away as <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, lined eight blocks approaching <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> on Monday for the funeral of <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, a 22-year-old rookie officer. `` If drug trafficking has become so bold that they can engage in the assassination of a police officer, then our whole society is at risk,'' Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said at the funeral service. `` That is why his death is so important.'' In his homily, the Rev. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVita </PERSON> said, `` <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON>'s murderers need to be pitied and also prayed for. They do not know about the sanctity of life. They can not really know or understand what they have done, even though this is such a terrible sin.'' Eight officers served as pallbearers as a bagpiper played `` When the Battle is Over.'' Police have been rounding up suspected crack dealers since the murder early Friday in hopes of finding someone who will shed light on the killing. Officer <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>, a police spokesman, said that as of Monday night, 108 had been arrested in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, where the killing took place. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> was guarding the house of a man who had complained to police about crack dealers in that neighborhood. The officer, who had been on the force just eight months, was hit by three shotgun blasts as he sat in a radio car. Others attending the funeral included Police Commissioner <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> and Officer <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, who was paralyzed below the neck by a gunman's bullet in 1986. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> had taken out a full page in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> on Monday. It bore <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>'s picture, and called upon the federal government to take tough measures with foreign governments that allow drug trafficking. Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, echoed <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s sentiments outside the church. `` Our nation's leaders appear to be isolated from our people in the streets who are being killed and from our youngsters who are becoming addicts,'' said <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>. `` Our nation's leaders do n't have the guts to cut off aid to countries run by narcotics dealers such as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, more than 2,000 people attended a memorial service Monday for Officer <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, the third <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> policeman killed in six weeks. He was off duty and moonlighting as a part-time security guard at a grocery store when he was gunned down Friday during an attempted robbery. Three men have been arrested, one of them a parolee who served less than a year of a five-year sentence for aggravated assault on a police officer.

A left-wing terrorist group that staged an almost identical slaying of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officer at the same <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> intersection in 1983 claimed responsibility for the assassination, authorities said. <PERSON> Alexandros </PERSON> <PERSON> Athanassiadis </PERSON>, 59, died of chest and stomach wounds from bullets that were fired through his car's open window while it was stopped at a red light on Kifissias Avenue, a police spokesman said. The spokesman, who requested anonymity, said the gunmen sped away and the motorbike was found abandoned. Doctors at the <ORGANIZATION> Hygeia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Athanassiadis </PERSON> died during surgery. `` He had multiple wounds in the chest and stomach. We tried heart massage for 15-20 minutes, but could n't revive him,'' Dr. <PERSON> Vassilis </PERSON> <PERSON> Georgoulis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Athanassiadis </PERSON> was chief executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Hellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> and Fertilizers company. The terrorist organization November 17 claimed responsibility for his killing in leaflets found in the street, the police spokesman said. The typewritten leaflet said the organization killed <PERSON> Athanassiadis </PERSON> because `` he was a classic capitalist ... indifferent to the health of the workers and the environment.'' The leaflet claimed that <ORGANIZATION> Hellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION>, which has a plant in a western industrial suburb of <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, was a major contributor to pollution. It also criticized the government, saying it had led <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> into `` economic, social and cultural crisis.'' A government statement expressed `` deepest sorrow and condolences'' and said the Greek `` people as a whole condemn such terrorist actions.'' <PERSON> Athanassiadis </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Katerina </PERSON>, told reporters her husband drove the same route to work every morning from their home in the <LOCATION> Ekali </LOCATION> suburb. `` He had n't told me of anything suspicious,'' she said. The police spokesman said the assailants pulled up beside Athanassiadis' car and tapped on the passenger side window. As it opened, they started firing. The attack took place at 8:15 a.m., he said. The shooting occurred at the same junction where a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officer was gunned down by the same terrorist group in November 1983, the spokesman said. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officer, Capt. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsantes </PERSON>, was attached to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. His driver also died in the attack. `` It was a carbon copy of the Tsantes killing _ the same traffic light, the same method with two men on a motorbike,'' the police spokesman said. November 17 has claimed responsibility for a dozen attacks against Americans, Greek police officers and businessmen since 1975. None of its members has been arrested. The left-wing group is named for the day in 1973 when troops and tanks crushed a student rebellion against the 1967-74 military dictatorship. November 17 says <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> bases in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> should be closed and that Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s socialist government has failed to change Greek society. Before today, the group had staged three attacks over the past year, none of which resulted in deaths. In April and August the group claimed responsibility for remote-control bomb blasts against buses carrying American military personnel, but in each case the bomb exploded prematurely. The group's most recent attempt involved a failed bomb attack in January against a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy staff member.

 A Civil War cannonball still capable of exploding has been turned over to bomb squad investigators by a man who believes as many as 25 others may have been taken as souvenirs. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Combs </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, 64, of <LOCATION> Clements </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, gave a rusted, six-inch, 120-year-old cannonball to the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> Fire Marshal's bomb squad Monday He became concerned after hearing news reports 10 days earlier that an identical cannonball that was given to the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clements </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> had been found to be live, said fire marshal's spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> The bomb squad determined <PERSON> Combs </PERSON>' cannonball also was live and took it to a bomb laboratory in <LOCATION> Harford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where investigators are trying to defuse and salvage the museum's cannonball, which a <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> clammer found in his net. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said both cannonballs have a fuse and contain black powder. `` If it detonates, it would send shrapnel from inside in all directions. -LRB- It was -RRB- meant to inflict numerous casualties,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Combs </PERSON> said his cannonball had been collecting dust in a tool shed behind his home since 1961, when he found it while deer hunting near <LOCATION> Chantilly </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Combs </PERSON> told officials he took the cannonball from a pyramid of about 20 to 25 others in a heavily wooded area, and that the stack appeared to have been left there since the Civil War, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. Combs noticed the pyramid of cannonballs becoming smaller during his hunting excursions over the next 20 years, until none were left, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` That means that at least 25 citizens might have a -LRB- live bomb -RRB- in their house or on their property,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. Investigators suspect it was a cache of Confederate munitions, he said. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said the bomb squad would pick up any suspect cannonballs for free and return them if they can be defused without damage. <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> officials plan to notify state and county authorities in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> about the discovery, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Former Queen <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON>, widow of the last king of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, made a brief return to the country without fanfare today after a 42-year exile imposed by the constitution. The Belgium-born <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, crossed the border by car this morning with her daughter, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriella </PERSON>, to attend a conference on <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Anselm </LOCATION> in this city near <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blanc </LOCATION>. After three hours, they drove back home. The Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> said the 81-year-old former queen of the House of Savoy initially went unnoticed as she took a seat in the back row of the conference hall. When officials realized who she was, they interrupted the meeting and invited her to sit in the front as the audience applauded, the report said. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> was invited to the conference last month by the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anselm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, of which she is an honorary member. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anselm </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION> was born in <LOCATION> Aosta </LOCATION> in the 11th century. `` I knew that she had been invited to the conference but I really did n't think she would actually come. She took us all by surprise,'' said <PERSON> Gianni </PERSON> <PERSON> Bondaz </PERSON>, president of the regional council. The former queen, who walked with a cane, wore a black pants suit, black cap, black gloves and a bright red scarf. She spoke only a few words to journalists, saying `` I did n't feel any special emotions entering <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> but I am happy. `` This morning when we crossed the border I was much more excited than she was,'' <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> quoted her daughter as saying. She quoted <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> as saying once they emerged from the <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blanc </LOCATION> tunnel in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, `` Oh how beautiful. The sun is out. I told you that the <LOCATION> Aosta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> is beautiful.'' The government last year lifted the constitutional ban on the entry of the former queen, who had made a request a year earlier to return to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. There have been unconfirmed media reports that she has secretly slipped into the country in the past. Her husband, <PERSON> Umberto </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, reigned for 26 days before being forced into exile in 1946 after a referendum abolished the monarchy. He died in exile in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> five years ago at the age of 78. The House of Savoy ruled over <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> for nine centuries and its kings reigned in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> from 1861 to 1946.

 Former boxer <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> `` Hurricane'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, breaking a 12-year silence after finally winning his long battle for freedom, says he was sentenced to `` a life of living death'' but is not bitter. `` For 20 years, I was considered a danger to society, a scourge upon humanity. I was locked away in an iron cage for not one, but three lifetimes,'' the former middleweight title contender said Monday in a news conference. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> was convicted in the 1966 murder of three white men in a Paterson bar and served 19 years in prison before the indictment was finally dismissed last week. But <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, 50, dressed in a tan suede jacket, dark tie and navy blue pants, said during the 90-minute news conference that he harbors no bitterness over the system that jailed him. `` If I have learned anything in my life, it's that bitterness consumes the vessel that contains it,'' he said. The 1966 verdict against <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Artis </PERSON> was overturned, but the two black men were again convicted in 1976. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who was serving a life term, was freed in 1985 by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, who found the conviction was tainted by racism and the witholding of information by prosecutors. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld the judge's 1985 decision, and a <LOCATION> Passaic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> judge last Friday signed the papers dismissing the indictment, as requested by county prosecutors. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> had remained in seclusion, declining to discuss the case publicly. But on Monday he condemned over-zealous prosecutors, the horrors of the state prison system, the jailing of innocent people and racism. `` They sentenced me to a life of living death,'' he said. `` And there is no other way to describe the nature of a prison. Prison destroys everything valuable in the life of a human being.'' <PERSON> Artis </PERSON>, paroled in 1981, is serving a six-year prison term on an unrelated drug charge. His lawyer, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Steel </PERSON>, issued a plea for <PERSON> Artis </PERSON>' freedom, saying the judge who sentenced him in the drug case improperly took the voided murder convictions into account in the sentencing. The drug sentence is on appeal. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s cause was taken up in the 1970s by celebrities, who championed him as a symbol of racial injustice. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> wrote a ballad about the case, which played repeatedly in the background before the news conference. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> refused to blame the trial's prosecutors directly for his fate, but said `` racism is sleazy'' and referred to <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON>'s finding that the prosecution made `` an appeal to racism rather than reason. Since being freed, he said he has worked on his case nearly every day and his third book, `` No Holds Barred, No Bars To Hold,'' while living in southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said he had difficulty understanding how he came to serve nearly two decades in prison. `` One moment I'm a championship prize fighter, the next moment and 20 years after I'm reviled as a triple murderer,'' he said. `` The fact that the most productive years of my life, the ages of 29 and 50, have been stolen, the fact that I was deprived of seeing my children grow up, would n't you think I would have a right to be bitter?'' he said. But being bitter would give the state another victory, he said. `` That would make me an accomplice to their crime.

Murder Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Police recently questioned pornographic film star <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, hospitalized and gravely ill bed with AIDS, about a 1981 mass murder for which he was tried and acquitted, a newspaper reported today. The appearance of a new witness and reports <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> may soon die from acquired immune deficiency syndrome prompted the bedside questioning, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, 43, a premier male sex film star of the 1970s and early 1980s, made hundreds of sexually explicit films and thousands of peep shows in his career. Citing unnamed sources, the newspaper reported a new witness has surfaced with information about the grisly beating deaths of four people in a house in the affluent hillside neighborhood of <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Egers </PERSON>, one of two lawyers who successfully defended <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> in 1982, refused to disclose what, if anything, <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> told homicide detectives. <PERSON> Egers </PERSON> confirmed that <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> is hospitalized with a serious illness but would not say if he suffers from AIDS. However, the newspaper quoted unidentified sources as saying <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>' illness has been positively diagnosed as AIDS, the incurable disease transmitted through sex, shared hypodermic needles and transfers of infected blood products. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> was cleared of killing four people who were found beaten to death in a Laurel Canyon home. Detective <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>, supervisor of the investigation, declined to discuss the case Monday except to say it remains active. Prosecutors said the four were part of a theft ring for which <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> acted as a middleman to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> nightclub owner <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON>, also known as <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nash </PERSON>. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> allegedly fenced stolen property for the group to <PERSON> Nash </PERSON>, who allegedly paid for the loot with drugs. <PERSON> Nash </PERSON>'s business had been robbed two days before the murder. Prosecutors alleged <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> staged the robbery and, when discovered, led killers to the <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION> home. Prosecutors claimed he committed one of the murders with his own hands. Jurors cited a lack of corroborating evidence for their vote for acquittal. <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> was sentenced in a separate case to eight years in prison for possession of two pounds of cocaine worth an estimated $ 1 million. He was released after serving less than two years. <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> said <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> remains a suspect in the <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION> killings, as does his one-time bodyguard, and that police have other suspects.

Evidence seized last year under a search warrant included a photograph showing a woman in a town of <LOCATION> Delavan </LOCATION> police uniform. The town had originally refused to release the allegations, but <PERSON> Polzin </PERSON> said town officials wanted to avoid a legal challenge by news media under the state's Open Records Law. `` We are releasing them,'' <PERSON> Polzin </PERSON> said, `` after considering the threats by the media about charges against the town and the consideration we may have to pay court costs and fines.'' The suspended patrolmen are <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Mortlock </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardwick </PERSON>, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Rome </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Lofy </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Drug-Addicted Infants Seem To Improve On Waterbeds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Waterbeds work wonders for babies born addicted to narcotics used by their mothers, a new study indicates, but researchers say they are n't sure why. Such infants have easier withdrawal, are more comfortable and are more likely to thrive if they lie on waterbeds instead of traditional bassinets, the study found. Infants going through drug withdrawal suffer many of the same symptoms that afflict adult addicts, including irritability, tremors, vomiting, abnormal sleeping and poor feeding. But a waterbed provides improved care that is `` safe, noninvasive, inexpensive and effective,'' said the researchers, whose findings were published in the February issue of the American Journal of Diseases of Children. One of the researchers, Dr. <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, cautioned that this is essentially an improved nursing technique and not even a partial solution to the problem posed by addicted infants. `` This study was to evaluate a simple nursing change to see if it could make life just a little better for children who have a lot of things stacked against them,'' said <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, with the pediatrics department at the Univerity of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. Waterbed use makes the early days of newborn addicts more comfortable, helps in some traditional treatments and hopefully gives youngsters a better chance for normal development, she said. She said researchers are n't sure why the waterbeds seem to help. More expensive oscillating waterbeds have been used successfully with premature non-addicted babies to provide movement stimulation. But the researchers found that newborn addicts can benefit from non-oscillating beds that are less expensive than traditional bassinets. `` Over half of the narcotic-exposed neonates required medication to control withdrawal symptoms,'' the researchers said. `` Those on waterbeds required a significantly lower maximum phenobarbital dose and had a lower incidence of hospital discharge with medication, thereby reducing the newborn's exposure to additional drugs.'' When discharged from the hospital, 63 percent of the waterbed babies had been weened from withdrawal medication, as opposed to 38 percent of infants in bassinets. The research was conducted on 30 infants born with an addiction to narcotics, mostly heroin or methadone. Half were put on waterbeds, half in bassinets. By the fifth day, researchers said, it was clear the waterbeds were having an impact. Withdrawal symptoms such as vomiting, tremors and congestion were less severe among the waterbed babies, the study found. They also went to sleep more easily and had improved weight gain.

<HEAD>Lawyer Says Husband To Blame For Children's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A woman charged with involuntary manslaughter says it was her husband who locked their two young children in a sun-baked car last summer, leading to the youngsters' deaths, her lawyer says <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON>, 19, of White Township, relied on her husband, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON>, 24, to take care of their children, <PERSON> Kristle </PERSON>, 3, and <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON>, 1, on Aug. 22, said lawyer <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> will `` testify his wife told him to watch the children while she went inside the house because she was ill,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said during opening remarks Monday in the first day of Mrs. Shield's trial Prosecutors called 11 witnesses Monday and were expected to call several more today before the defense began its case. The couple left a party early on Aug. 22 and drove to a relative's farmhouse, according to an affidavit by state police. Mrs. <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> slept in the car with the children from about 5 a.m. to 9 a.m., and <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> went into the house, police said. Then Mrs. <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> went into the house and asked her husband to take care of the children, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. Shields moved the car to a sunnier location and rolled up the windows, police said. When Mrs. <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> checked the children several hours later, she found <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> unconscious and <PERSON> Kristle </PERSON> gasping for breath, according to police. <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> was pronounced dead at the scene and his sister died the next day in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>'s Mercy Hospital. Autopsies showed both died of high temperatures. Mrs. <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> also is charged with endangering the welfare of children. Her husband faces identical charges and is scheduled to go on trial later this month in <LOCATION> Mifflin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Each defendant won a change of venue from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> after defense attorneys argued pre-trial publicity made seating an impartial jury impossible there. They have been jailed since their arrests.

 Fifty-two people were arrested and at least $ 85,000 worth of exotic animals and organs were seized during an undercover investigation, according to a published report. The <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> reported today that officers seized a variety of animal parts including genitalia from tigers and sea lions, rhinoceros horns and dried abalone. Several hundred male sex organs from other species were also seized, said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> and Game patrol chief at the department's <LOCATION> Yountville </LOCATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Napa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>.

Most of the charges involve poaching and commercialization of wildlife, both misdemeanor violations of the state Fish and Game Code, he said. <PERSON> Munroe </PERSON> said the animal parts were marketed mostly to the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> community as aphrodisiacs and general health foods. In some cases, he said, gall bladders from cows or pigs were sold as bear organs.

<HEAD>Curfew Imposed In Sumgait, Site Of Rioting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL PUTZEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Soviet government spokesman said today a curfew was imposed in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, the city in <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION> where rioting broke out two days ago. He said `` some mistakes'' had been made concerning a disputed territory that is home to tens of thousands of Armenians. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said the situation was calm but tense in <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, where ethnic hatred triggered demonstrations, violence and at least two deaths in recent days. He suggested the unrest resulted from a `` mistake'' made 65 years ago when a territory composed largely of ethnic Armenians was made part of neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION>. `` There were certain injuries'' in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, an industrial city where hooligans were blamed for touching off a riot Sunday, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. At his regular briefing today, the Soviet spokesman was peppered with questions about the unrest in the southern republics of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and Azerbaidzhan. However, he said he had few details. Foreign journalists have been barred from the region, and only sporadic reports from witnesses, activists and the official media have reached <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> was asked about reports that Soviet tanks are patrolling <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, that ethnic Azeris are attacking Armenians there and that there have been at least two deaths in the city. He responded that `` there is a curfew'' in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, but that he had not heard anything about tanks being sent into the city. `` The situation is calm there today, but it is tense,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. Asked if troops remained in the city today, he said, `` I do n't know, but I guess so Presumably.'' The violence in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, reported Monday by the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, followed outbreaks 150 miles away in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, the contested region in <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION>, and mass demonstrations in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. The demonstrators demanded that <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, which has been part of <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION> since 1923, be made part of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Three-quarters of the area's 157,000 residents are Armenian. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said he did not have detailed reports from the entire region but that what information he had indicated `` everything is calm'' in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> and surrounding areas. `` The events that took place caused great concern to us,'' he said. `` We think it is not a proper way to settle the problems that have accumulated.'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> acknowledged, however, that the unrest apparently stemmed from `` some mistakes made in the national relations, and these mistakes should be rectified.'' Soviet authorities have pledged to reconsider the issue of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s parent republic, and <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>'s statement seemed to indicate the region might be turned over to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. He did not, however, say when that might occur. Asked if he meant to say that <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> should be made part of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said: `` I meant there were some mistakes in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>.'' He described the region as `` a kind of enclave'' in <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION> with 49 nationalities represented among the population that is nonetheless mostly Armenian. `` That is why we should be very tactful in handling this question in order not to cause differences between brothers and nationalities. The previous policy had some mistakes in this area,'' he said. On Friday, Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> appealed for `` civil maturity and restraint'' and promised the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> would review relations among the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s more than 100 nationalities Azerbaidzhan is the largest of three Soviet republics in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION>. It is bordered on the west by largely <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armenia </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and on the north by the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> turned today to King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> to back the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drive for <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace talks. `` He's a key, in my opinion,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` He has immense standing and a person who's been here a long time. Through all of these issues, up and down, he's a man of experience and judgment.'' Talking to reporters on his flight from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> hinted he was inclined to return to the region after a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit meeting in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> Wednesday and Thursday. `` Nobody has signed up to our proposal, but everybody wants us to keep working, so we will keep working,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said in a departure statement in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` We will continue our efforts,'' he said. After arriving at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, he met <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> at a private residence owned by the king in central <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> also was to see Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> before flying to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> later today. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, diplomatic sources, demanding anonymity, said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had told <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> he would return after the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit if <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> gave at least qualified support to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal. It calls for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, and Palestinians to open negotiations on about April 1 on self-rule of the 1.5 million Palestinian Arabs who live on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. Talks on an overall <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> settlement would begin by December. `` We are still very much in a process of working,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said as he left <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. While in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, he met with <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> officials including Crown Prince <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>. But only the king, who went to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for dental treatment, can give an authoritative response for the Arab country that occupied the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> from 1949 to 1967. `` King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> is a very critical factor in it all,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said aboard his <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jet. He said he would report to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> and go back to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> after the summit if `` he wants me to.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> acknowledged he had made little concrete progress during four days of talks with Israeli and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders. While he said he could see a narrowing of differences, `` I do n't know if I could describe them in a way that would be perceptible to anyone else.'' And yet, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, `` Assuming everyone continues the attitude they have to keep working, to keep working, we'll do it.'' A senior <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> official who demanded anonymity said <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> officials had surprised <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> by hardening their insistence on holding an international conference and by abandoning previous support for a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has opposed a U.N.-sponsored conference attended by the five permament members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>: the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. He has argued such a forum would be biased against the Jewish state. The joint delegation was a key element of U.S.-sponsored peacemaking efforts because it got around <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> refusal to talking with <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, speaking to children in the resort city of <LOCATION> Elat </LOCATION>, suggested that King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> sought a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> role in selecting a negotiating team. `` <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> says he wants the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> without <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. Let's go along with him on this formula ... <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, yes, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, no,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said in remarks aired on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. His remarks were initially interpreted as a change in position, but <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> aides said there had been a `` misunderstanding.'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' spokesman <PERSON> Uri </PERSON> <PERSON> Savir </PERSON> issued a clarification, stressing <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> is against talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and was referring to <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s position <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who put his personal prestige on the line during the shuttle, found the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> deeply divided by distrust and a volatile <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where 76 Arabs have been killed since rioting began Dec. 8. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> is scheduled to visit <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in two weeks for talks with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. But it could be a third key figure, chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, who has been most instrumental in upsetting <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s mission. One major <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> objective was to meet with a delegation of Palestinian Arabs in order to get their goals in negotiations. But under <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> instructions, all 15 he invited to a session last Friday in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> stayed away. In <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, reporters briefed under rules that prevented them from disclosing their sources were told <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> no longer would put pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to form a joint negotiating team. Now, reporters were told, the Palestinians all look to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as their sole representative and <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> did not intend to stand in their way. The hardened Arab stance was said to be in response to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s suppression of Palestinian protests However, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official suggested that <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> was more flexible in the private talks with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. `` I do n't see any sign that <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> positions are hardening.'' But the official added, `` We are not at the point where anybody is saying yes or no.''

 An heiress whose lawsuit pushed a church into bankruptcy was among four bidders for the church's property in a recent auction <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dovydenas </PERSON>' $ 2.56 million bid for property of The Bible Speaks church in <LOCATION> Lenox </LOCATION> was the third highest bid, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Normandin </PERSON>, attorney for the court-appointed trustee managing the church estate, said Monday. He said the high bid of $ 2.81 million came from a group called <ORGANIZATION> Lenox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>. Its lawyer, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, declined to reveal the partners' identities. Second was Kaslin Properties of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with a bid of $ 2.61 million, <PERSON> Normandin </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Dovydenas </PERSON> had argued in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last April that she was duped out of a third of her chain-store fortune by the founder and leader of the fundamentalist sect, Rev. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, while she was a parishioner from 1983 to 1986. The Bible Speaks campus closed last year after Mrs. <PERSON> Dovydenas </PERSON> prevailed in her $ 6.6 million claim. Lawyers for the church plan to appeal a federal judge's recent decision upholding the claim. Her claim is by far the largest of hundreds of creditors, who claim they are owed more than $ 7 million by the church. Monday was the deadline for bids on the 65-acre estate with its 28 buildings. <PERSON> Normandin </PERSON> said the final round of bidding could come at a hearing Monday at <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Dovydenas </PERSON> had been the high bidder at a November auction of the church headquarters, but the <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected her $ 1.8 million bid as too low. The campus has been appraised at $ 6 million.

 Forty minority students at <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> have reached an agreement with the administration to end their week-long takeover of a dormitory, a college spokeswoman said today. The students had complained of racism at the private liberal arts school. `` By the end of the day we expect the agreement to be fully signed,'' said administration spokeswoman <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON>. Spokesmen for the protesters holding the <ORGANIZATION> Dakin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> office were out of the building and could not be reached for comment. College President <PERSON> Adele </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> met Monday with representatives of the blacks, Hispanics, Indians and other minorities who have held the small brick building since Feb. 23. Their 16 demands included the creation of the post of dean of multicultural affairs and for a full-time coordinator for the minority student group. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> last week offered the students $ 25,000 to spend as they please on their programs, but the negotiators rejected the offer. `` That's really an absurd amount for what is needed,'' protest spokeswoman <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Fearman </PERSON> said Monday. College spokeswoman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Wicks </PERSON> said the students evidently did not understand the college's budget. `` When you see our high tuition, you think there must be lots of extra money on campus,'' she said. `` We're ending this year on a deficit and they're asking us to come up with bucks in March. Yes, we want to be supportive, but in fact we do n't have the money.'' Tuition at the private liberal arts school was nearly $ 16,000 this year, she said. Minorities represent about 10 percent of the school's 1,100 students.

<HEAD>`Glass Ceiling' Seen Blocking Women's Entry To Top Media Jobs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FELIX GUTIERREZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More women are working in entertainment and the news media, but they bump into a `` glass ceiling'' that prevents them from rising into top management jobs, experts told a conference on Women, Men and Media. `` While more women are hired, that does n't always translate up,'' said <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> journalism professor <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, citing data gathered during a five-year study of women in media. `` I do see that glass ceiling,'' Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> told the conference Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>. She described the `` glass ceiling'' as `` a transparent barrier'' that allows women to see top echelon jobs but blocks access to them. Women account for 66 percent of the nation's journalism graduates, but less than 2 percent of newspaper corporate management, 5 percent of publishers and general managers, and 13 percent of directing editors, she said. `` The employment of women in news media lags behind employment in the society overall,'' Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` If current trends continue, women wo n't attain directing editorships on par with their level of the population until 2055.'' Despite gains in front of the television camera, Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> reported similar patterns in broadcast management. She said no networks had a woman heading their news division, and only nine of 51 network news vice presidents are women. Local television stations also have few women in management, Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. But she said radio stations employ women in proportion to the workforce. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, anchor on <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> television station <ORGANIZATION> KNBC </ORGANIZATION>, said some women in television are treated as `` shadow anchors'' to a male co-anchor, are assigned to `` soft stories'' and are not allowed to age. `` You do n't see very many female <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuralts </PERSON> on television, or women who look like <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, naming two veteran male newscasters. The three-day conference, which started Sunday, was organized by <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedan </PERSON>, author of the best-selling `` The Feminine Mystique'' and a visiting journalism professor at <ORGANIZATION> USC </ORGANIZATION>. An analysis of credits on 1986-87 network entertainment series found women employed more often as writers than as producers or directors, said <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Steenland </PERSON> of Wider Opportunities for Women. Seventeen of the top 20 shows had women writers. half had women producers and six had directors. <PERSON> Futurist </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Toffler </PERSON> said women have a chance to manage new media as communication becomes diversified by cable television and other outlets targeting `` micro markets'' within the mass audience. `` We're going to see two-tiered media,'' said <PERSON> Toffler </PERSON>. Mass media will cover major events, but customized media will provide information and entertainment to audiences defined by such characteristics as race, sex, interest or geographic area, he said. The conference was co-sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> USC </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalism </ORGANIZATION>, the Institute for the Study of Women and Men, Women in Film, and the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>

<HEAD>Three Italians Come Home After Release By Kurdish Captors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERGAMO, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three Italian engineers, including one blinded in an eye during his abduction, came home today after they were released by pro-Iranian Kurds following five months of captivity. Former hostages <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cominetti </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Diotallevi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrara </PERSON> boarded a commercial plane in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on Monday and flew to <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, where they were met by an Italian government plane. They landed at the northern Italian airport of <PERSON> Orio </PERSON> al Serio outside <LOCATION> Bergamo </LOCATION>. The Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> reported that men were in good condition on their arrival in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and quoted all three as agreeing that they had been treated well in captivity and had never feared for their lives. `` You could call the treatment they gave us humane,'' <PERSON> Carrara </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` We were allowed to talk to our captors. Between us a climate of mutual respect was established.'' A group calling itself the <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kurdish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for the kidnappings in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> last October, demanding a halt to Italian aid to the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> government and removal of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s ships from the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The kidnappers also made a request for 2,000 gas masks. In announcing the release of the hostages, the Italian <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday said the three were freed because of its `` intense and discreet'' efforts, but did not elaborate. In a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> with the Italian daily <ORGANIZATION> Corriere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> della </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sera </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, <PERSON> Diotallevi </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cominetti </PERSON> did not join the other two hostages until after they were freed. <PERSON> Cominetti </PERSON> was taken hostage last September and the other two in October while they were working in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on electrical engineering projects for two Italian companies. <PERSON> Carrara </PERSON> said the most dramatic moment was when they were taken hostage. Returning to their headquarters from work, they noticed they were being followed by a taxi. `` We thought of bandits and tried to escape,'' he said. Guerrillas fired several times. A splinter from one of the bullets hit Diotallevi, injuring his right eye. During the interview, <PERSON> Diotallevi </PERSON> added that there were no doctors to treat the injury and that the eye since has gone blind. <PERSON> Diotallevi </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Carrara </PERSON> were held `` in different refuges'' in the mountains during their captivity.

 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said today it fired 14 surface-to-surface missiles of its own design and production into the Iranian capital in a 24-hour blitz lasting late into this afternoon. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> vowed revenge and said one Iraqi strike killed 16 people when it struck a <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> hospital. At least one other fatality was reported in the Iranian capital. It was the worst escalation of the so-called `` war of the cities'' that has killed thousands of civilians since 1985. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have been at war since 1980. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said it began firing the missiles into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> Monday afternoon in retaliation for two pre-dawn missile strikes on <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> initially reported its capital of 6 million people was under attack by <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes. It later said missiles had struck the city. One person was killed and several wounded this morning by a missile that destroyed or damaged several houses and shops in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said at least 16 civilians were killed and dozens wounded, `` including newborn babies,'' when the hospital was hit Monday night. An unspecified number of people were buried when part of the hospital building collapsed, the agency said. The Iranians did not say whether the missiles were fired from land or air. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s air force outnumbers <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s 8-to-1. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had never before used surface-to-surface missiles to attack <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, which is 290 miles from the Iraqi border. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> protested to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> and vowed revenge if the attacks did not stop. `` <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Moslem combatants will not sit quiet until they take revenge,'' <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> quoted a military communique as saying. An Iranian military communique called on residents of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> to evacuate `` and seek shelter in the four previously identified holy cities in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to protect their lives'' from retaliation. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is determined to demonstrate `` who is stronger when it comes to demonstration of power,'' warned the communique. An <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> communique, meanwhile, today reported the firing of two more missiles it said scored `` effective hits in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and turned their targets into rubble.'' It did not disclose the nature of the targets. Another Iraqi communique said Iranian artillery gunners this morning resumed pounding the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> port city of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>. One man was killed and women, children and other civilians were injured, said the communique, quoted by the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> began firing the missiles into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in retaliation for two pre-dawn missile strikes Monday that killed or wounded `` many civilians'' in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, reported <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s news agency. It said five <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> missiles crashed in the Iranian capital before midnight Monday, two after midnight, two at dawn, two this morning, and three this afternoon. Apparently interrupted by the afternoon missile strikes, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> television went off the air for few minutes today, but resumed its newscast later from another broadcast room. No explanation was given. The Iranian and Iraqi agency and television reports were monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. One Iraqi communique said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> missiles `` poured with an enormous destruction power on <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, striking with accuracy'' and destroying `` the nests of tyrants and aggression in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>.'' The Iranian news agency said relief workers were rushing casualties to hospitals. <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> urged Iranians to take refuge in bomb shelters. The <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted a military spokesman as saying the missiles `` had been designed by Iraqi minds and put together by Iraqi hands'' and said: `` The Iraqi rockets will reduce the Iranian capital to rubble.'' The agency said President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> named the new Iraqi missile `` <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>,'' after the Shiite Moslem saint. It said the projectile has a range of 400 miles.

 <ORGANIZATION> R.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> made a surprise bid for <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, challenging a competing offer by <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for the nation's largest department store operator. The bid Monday by New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> is valued at about $ 6.6 billion, topping the $ 6.1 billion offer from <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, a Toronto-based department store and real estate company, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> responded today that `` their deal is simply not competitive'' and that it was prepared to structure an offer along the lines of the <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> proposal. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> has been trying to buy <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> for more than a month, but <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s board rejected three successively richer offers. On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> sweetened its offer again and <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> agreed to stop fighting and start merger talks. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> disclosed <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> offer late Monday night from its headquarters here after <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s board met in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to consider the latest, $ 68-a-share offer from <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> for all of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s 89.6 million common shares outstanding. <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> declined today to comment publicly today on its offer. Under the prposal, privately held <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION>'s would make a cash tender offer for approximately 80 percent of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s outstanding shares at $ 73.80 per share, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> said <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> shares not purchased in the tender offer would be exchanged in a merger transaction, for a number of newly issued shares of <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> common stock, equal to approximately 40 percent of the unpurchased shares. No value could immediately be placed on the stock portion of the buyout offer, but the total offer would be worth about $ 6.6 billion if valued at $ 73.80 in cash or stock for all of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s shares. `` The transaction just depends too heavily on the speculative trading value of the shares of a new highly leveraged combined <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> - <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Campeau </PERSON> said `` If the <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> board prefers a two-tiered offer rather than our all - cash $ 68 offer, we are prepared to structure a transaction along those lines,'' he said The Federated board took no action on the <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> bid but directed its management and advisers to investigate <PERSON> Macy </PERSON>'s proposals, to negotiate a definitive agreement and submit both negotiated agreements to the board as soon as possible, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> said <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> officials did not know when the board would get the proposals, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanger </PERSON>. The board of directors of the merged company, which would be called <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> - <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, would include significant representation from the existing <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> board, The <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> proposal would be subject to execution of a definitive merger agreement, and to approval by the boards of directors and stockholders of both companies. Some Macy's outside directors already have participated in the deliberations, Ms. <PERSON> Sanger </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> was taken private in a $ 3.6 billion leveraged buyout by management in 1986. Its stockholders and directors include <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Taubman </PERSON>, a major shopping mall developer, and <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON>, the chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Loews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The company is one of the nation's biggest and best-known retailers. Its approximately 100 stores rang up $ 5.21 billion in sales during the year ended Aug. 1. Cincinnati-based <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> took in $ 11 billion last year from its more than 650 department stores, supermarkets and other outlets nationwide, including the <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s, <ORGANIZATION> Filene </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Burdine </PERSON>'s, <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>'s and Gold Circle chains. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> stock closed up $ 2 at $ 66.50 a share in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading Monday. In addition to the <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> proposal, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s board had been considering whether to entirely shun purchase offers in favor of a restructuring that would keep present management in control. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> has been pressing its takeover attempt since Jan. 25. In December 1986, the company acquired giant <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, whose operations include the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marsh </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>'s, <ORGANIZATION> Brooks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> retail chains. Some industry analysts have said they expect <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> to continue soliciting other buyers to fend off <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s overtures.

 Republican <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, playing catch-up in the Southern presidential primaries, attacked <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in public and in new television commercials today as a vice president without record or accomplishment and a supporter of the arms-for-hostages deal with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s campaign began airing tough ads striking at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, as <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> escalated criticism of the vice president at appearances at <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` That's precisely what he did _ he supported the sale of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said when asked about the new television attack. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> minority leader, accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of offering `` nine different answers'' on the Iran-Contra affair. `` But it's a fact he did support it,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` Now we're talking about credibility,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` When somebody gives you nine different answers on the same question, I think it's an issue.'' Trailing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the polls in most of the states voting next week, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> began a test-run of strong television ads in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and other selected <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> cities, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> said. The ads, which the <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaign produced but did not run during the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> campaign, depict <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as walking through snow but leaving no footprints, <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> said. He said the message was that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` has held all these big jobs'' yet left no mark. In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> began airing a different ad that injected the Iran-Contra affair into the campaign, saying that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` supported arms for hostages.'' It also says <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` waffles on taxes'' and opposes legislation limiting textile imports, a bill that <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> supports and that is popular in the textile-producing <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> last week that he opposes the textile bill as protectionist. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> spoke to students on the campus of <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where his wife <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> attended college. While there he lashed at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for saying repeatedly that he wants to be `` the education president.'' `` Well he's certainly been quiet the last seven years when the administration's been whacking billions and billions of dollars out of the education budget,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` Have n't heard one word.'' A day earlier in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> told a downtown crowd to question <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on his record. `` Ask him what's he done in the last seven years,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` What's he done anywhere in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> or the world to make a difference?'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> minority leader, cited his own record in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and raised anew his claim that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had distorted <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s stand on tax increases in television commercials that helped <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> win the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said voters want to elect `` someone who is not out trying to distort somebody else's record when they do n't have a record of their own.'' `` <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> is not going to raise your taxes,'' he said. `` We do n't know what <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is going to do.'' `` Tough'' was a word <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> brandished as he flew around the South drawing comparisons with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in advance of the big round of primaries across the region and elsewhere on Super Tuesday, a week away. `` I have a quality that some may be lacking. I am tough,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and echoed in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. And for anyone missing his comparison with the vice president, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said: `` I'm tougher.'' Reacting to the crisis in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> called for a full trade embargo against that country if its military strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> stays in power, and he urged the use of force if necessary to protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests there, including the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has sent mixed signals on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is accused of drug trafficking. And <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> suggested the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reconsider transferring the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> to that country if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> appears able to retain power. `` You just ought to say no to drugs, no to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, and no, maybe, to giving them the canal,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. He said some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have made conciliatory statements about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and ignored old evidence of drug involvement in the Panamanian military. `` It seems to me we have one signal indicating <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> ought to stay or <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is n't such a bad guy,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. He singled out <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, former chief of staff to Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who he said described <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as cooperative, and cited `` other indications they did n't know about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and drugs until a few weeks ago.'' `` Strange thing,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` We knew about it when we were debating the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaty 10 years ago. In fact many of us talked about it on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> frequently mentioned his vote against the treaty, tranferring eventual ownership of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, that was narrowly ratified 10 years ago. He said that if it appears <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s situation will go unchanged, `` we may want to go back and take another look at that canal.'' `` We may not want to turn it over to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, if they're going to be in this state,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said.

 Republican presidential candidate <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said today a transcript of 1967 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee testimony supports his belief there are nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The former religious broadcaster quoted testimony from two people: _ <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bethel </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official who said <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> refugees had told him about seeing missiles _ One of the refugees, identified only as Mr. <PERSON> Apud </PERSON>, who said members of the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> military had told him about missiles aimed at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> before he left in 1966 In the 1967 Judiciary subcommittee transcript, <PERSON> Apud </PERSON> said he was told by <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> soldiers he had known for many years that the missiles were nicknamed `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Left,'' `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Right'' and `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Central.'' The transcript also showed that <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> said in response to questioning by Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, that numerous refugees had told him they had seen missiles left in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> after the Cuban Missile Crisis and new ones put in in 1964. <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> testified he could not say for sure that intermediate or intercontinental ballistic missiles were in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, but that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also could n't be certain they were n't there. `` This is documented evidence,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said today at a breakfast attended by about 600 supporters. He first brought the subject up in a debate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> last month, contending there are missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> aimed at the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration immediately denied it. At a news conference on Monday, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> produced a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> refugee who he said had seen the weapons. The Cuban, who spoke through an interpreter and identified himself only as <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, said he had seen missile sites, but did not know whether the weapons had nuclear warheads.

<HEAD>First Day of Expressway Reconstruction Not So Bad</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The first morning of reconstruction on the city's major highway link to the south passed without major traffic jams, police said today `` So far, so good,'' state police Sgt. <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Enright </PERSON> said of the traffic on the <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Expressway </PERSON>, one of the nation's busiest highways. Most commuters apparently heeded warnings about potential traffic problems and took other routes or public transportation. The project will widen the <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> from four lanes each way to five. During 6 -LCB- months of construction on southbound lanes this year, all traffic will share four lanes. The northbound lanes will be out of commission next year during the project's second phase. Some motorists had planned novel ways to cope with massive traffic jams they had expected. <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coenen </PERSON> said bought tape-recorded `` talking books,'' such as <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Michener </PERSON>'s `` <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' to listen to while she sits in traffic. `` I think it's going to be like a huge, huge parking lot,'' says Ms. <PERSON> Coenen </PERSON>, who lives in northwest suburban <LOCATION> Elk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> and uses the <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Expressway </PERSON> to commute to her job as a health educator at <ORGANIZATION> Michael </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on the city's <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>. `` I have visions of people taking folding chairs and tables and playing cards.'' `` I think it's going to be a real bad nightmare,'' says <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, 35, a hospital secretary who commutes from her home in south suburban <LOCATION> Evergreen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> to her job in south <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Expressway </PERSON>, an 11-mile stretch of concrete and asphalt, is the main link between <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and points south. Traffic from at least six other expressways feeds the <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> just south of downtown <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. State officials say the $ 210 million rebuilding job will be the largest highway project in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> history. `` The road is simply wearing out from old age and the pounding it has taken from traffic, particularly trucks,'' says <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Adorjan </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>. The state plans to close all four southbound lanes from March 13 to October 31, rerouting southbound traffic onto two of the four northbound lanes. The process will be reversed in the spring of 1989. The work began today with the closing of several lanes on each side of the freeway for a week to build traffic crossovers and patch the northbound side. As the project began, a psychiatrist recommended deep breaths, exercise or conversation as tension easers for stalled commuters. `` Drivers who are mentally prepared to face these difficulties can reduce the stress,'' says Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Glass </PERSON>, associate psychiatry professor and director of adult outpatient services at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. He said drivers could also use their stall time to learn a foreign language from taped lessons or dictate letters into a tape recorder.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, making it easier to deport some aliens, today blocked further hearings for a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> man seeking to avoid return to his native <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION>. The court ruled 8-0 that immigration officials, having decided an alien should be deported, generally are under no duty to reconsider the case when the alien says he has new evidence to support a bid for asylum. The decision is a defeat for Dr. <PERSON> Assibi </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abudu </PERSON>, a native and citizen of <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION> who graduated from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> medical school and married a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen. Immigration officials moved to deport him in 1981 after he was convicted in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> of illegally attempting to obtain the narcotic drug demerol by fraud. He was given a one-year suspended prison sentence and was placed on probation for three years. The Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> found him deportable and the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld that decision. <PERSON> Abudu </PERSON> sought to reopen his case in 1985 and seek asylum in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from the military dictatorship of Flight Lieutenant <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rawlings </PERSON>, who regained power in <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION> in a Dec. 31, 1981, military coup. <PERSON> Abudu </PERSON> said he had new evidence that his life might be in danger if he was forced to return to <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION> based on a 1984 visit to him by <PERSON> Abukari </PERSON> <PERSON> Alhassan </PERSON>, secretary of housing and construction in the <PERSON> Rawlings </PERSON> regime. <PERSON> Abudu </PERSON> said he believed <PERSON> Alhassan </PERSON> was trying to lure him back to <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION> so officials there could torture him to extract information about opponents of the <PERSON> Rawlings </PERSON> regime. <PERSON> Abudu </PERSON> said his brother escaped capture by the regime and fled into hiding and also said his lifelong friend, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamidu </PERSON>, is regarded as the number one enemy of the <PERSON> Rawlings </PERSON> government. The <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> refused to reopen <PERSON> Abudu </PERSON>'s case, noting that <PERSON> Abudu </PERSON> did not initially seek asylum when he contested his deportation. But the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 ordered the board to reconsider granting <PERSON> Abudu </PERSON> asylum. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration that the appeals court should have deferred to the decision of the immigration board. Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, writing for the court, said aliens seeking to reopen their deportation cases have the difficult task of proving that immigration officials abused their discretion in refusing to do so. `` There is a strong public interest in bringing litigation to a close as promptly as is consistent with the interest in giving the adversaries a fair opportunity to develop and present their respective cases,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said. `` We have no hesitation in concluding that the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> did not abuse its discretion when it held that <PERSON> Abudu </PERSON> had not reasonably explained his failure to apply for asylum prior to the completion of the initial deportation proceeding,'' he said. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who only recently joined the court, did not take part in the decision. The case is <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Abudu </PERSON>, 86-1128.

 A survey released today says that the threat of malpractice suits caused 12 percent of obstetricians to close their practices last year and that two-thirds leave the field before age 55. The survey, conducted in October and November for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Obstetricians </ORGANIZATION> and Gynecologists, showed that the national rate for physicians dropping obstetrics has remained at 12 percent for the last two years, but that the age of those quitting is getting younger. `` If this trend continues, we are going to see more and more physicians leaving obstetrics at the height of their professional ability,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Jimmie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON>, chairman of the doctors' committee on professional liability `` We are looking at a situation where obstetrics is being concentrated more and more in large urban and suburban areas.'' In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the number of doctors no longer delivering babies has reached 25 percent, about twice the national average, and 75 percent of those quitting in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> are doing so before the age 55, also far above the national average. Malpractice insurance premiums for obstetricians in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> now average about $ 52,000 a year, the survey shows. The national average has risen from $ 10,946 in 1982 to $ 37,015 in 1987, according to the report. <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON> said the survey revealed `` several disturbing trends'' in the care of high-risk pregnancies. Twenty-seven of the surveyed doctors said they were limiting the number of high-risk cases they will take, compared to 23 percent in 1985, and 18 percent in 1982. The survey showed that seven out of 10 obstetrician-gynecologists nationally have been sued at some point in their career. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, 55 percent of the practicioners have been sued two or more times. Fifty-two percent of the suits involved obstetric cases, with 31 percent of these cases for claims of neurologically-impaired infants, and 15 percent for claims of stillbirths or infant deaths, the survey showed. Of the claims resolved, 36 percent were dropped without payment. Of those not dropped, 79 percent were settled with payment. The survey showed that obstetrician-gynecologists had a mean gross income in 1986 of $ 296,133, with the highest gross in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, with $ 387,022, and in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, with $ 323,252. The mean gross income increased by $ 81,122 from 1984 to 1986, the survey showed. The average medical practice overhead reported was $ 147,029, with the average for <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> at $ 190,882. <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> conducted the survey for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Obstetricians </ORGANIZATION> and Gynecologists.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today declined to decide yet whether the state or the federal government should control a Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> area off <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s southwestern coastline. Rejecting arguments by the state's lawyers, the court ruled 7-0 that more information is needed before such a determination is made. <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> had sought a ruling that its southwestern coastline extends beyond several barrier islands and into <LOCATION> Chandeleur </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION>, south of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> Sound. Control of an area of about 150 square miles of the gulf, along with control of the natural resources there, remains in dispute. The case acted on today has, in varying forms, been before the high court since 1956, when the justices first invoked their `` original jurisdiction'' to hear the controversy before it had been aired in any lower court. In such cases, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> functions as a trial court and acts on the recommendations of a court-appointed `` special master.'' In this case, retired Judge <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> is serving as the special master. He recommended that <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s pressing for a ruling that gives it control of the disputed gulf area should be ruled premature. Writing for the court today, Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> agreed. He said <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s arguments `` are overruled but without prejudice to the advancement of such claims as any party might have with respect to the area south of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> in the vicinity of <LOCATION> Chandeleur </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> in an appropriate separate chapter of these proceedings.'' The <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> Sound is a body of water between the state's mainland and a line of barrier islands several miles offshore In 1985, the justices ruled that <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> _ and not the federal government _ own their respective portions of the sound's bed and therefore control the natural resources there. <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> said the high court would retain jurisdiction in the case, raising the likelihood that still another ruling on the issue is in the court's future. Justices <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> did not participate in the decision. The case is <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> Boundardy Case, 9 Original.

 A `` puff'' of tritium escaped from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> Plant today, but posed no hazard to the public, officials said. Spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Felder </PERSON> said about 20,000 curies of tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, were released at 6:18 a.m. this morning during routine operations. <PERSON> Felder </PERSON> characterized the release as `` a puff'' and said it lasted less than a minute. The weapons production facility at the plant makes material used in the production of nuclear weapons, and <PERSON> Felder </PERSON> said details on the process under way when the release occurred are classified. The exposure at the plant boundary, about six miles from the H Chemical Separations Area where the release occurred, was about 0.04 millirems, <PERSON> Felder </PERSON> said. By comparison, he said a normal chest X-ray is 20 millirems. Two employees in the work area at the time of the release were undergoing tests to see if they suffered any ill effects. They were wearing full protective gear at the time, he said. All plant operations have returned to normal, he said. <PERSON> Felder </PERSON> said an initial assessment of the cause of the release indicates equipmment malfunction. However, an investigation will be conducted. The last such release at the plant occurred July 31, 1987, when a dosage of .2 millirems was measured at the plant's boundary. The plant's reactors were reduced to half power last year amid concerns over the cooling system, and <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> officials told a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Monday that the reactors could be running at full capacity by 1990. <PERSON> Felder </PERSON> said this morning the process in which the tritium was released is separate from that involving the reactors and would not affect the reactor plans.

 How does a presidential candidate campaign for 20 far-flung contests held on the same day? The answer is television. The primaries and caucuses of March 8, Super Tuesday, are being held in states and territories from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, an unprecedented sweep across more than 150 media markets with more than 500 television stations. Television is as critical on the vast Super Tuesday battleground as grass-roots organizing was in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> fired an opening salvo, starting a test-run of tough television ads in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> ad, which the <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaign produced but did not run during the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> campaign, depicts Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> walking through snow but leaving no footprints. The message, said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>, was that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` has held all these big jobs'' yet left no mark. The other <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> ad, running in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, injects the Iran-Contra affair into the campaign. It says <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` supported arms for hostages,'' `` waffles on taxes'' and opposes legislation limiting textile imports, a bill <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> supports and that is popular in the textile-producing <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> last week that he opposes the textile bill as protectionist. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> also was taking the offensive with two critical ads. One featured Rep. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Leath </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> criticizing <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> rivals <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> Jr. The other was a retooled version of an ad that was considered a key factor in <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s victory over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> last week in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. At the outset of his campaign, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> mentioned Belgian endive, a kind of yuppie lettuce, as an example of how <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> farmers could diversify their crops. The <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> ad criticizes the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's positions on trade and farm issues, and ends with a voice saying sarcastically: `` Belgian endive?'' Many observers said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made a major error in not responding with an ad of his own _ a situation that wo n't be repeated. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign had prepared a negative ad about <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and would use it soon, possibly starting today, in Super Tuesday states. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> has also revived an ad that was seen as having a big impact in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> _ in which he criticizes <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for stifling <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> auto sales in that nation with stiff tariffs, and threatens to respond in kind. See how many Hyundais the Koreans can sell here at $ 48,000 apiece, he tells viewers. And <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> has a commercial featuring the popular Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, a Democrat who has ample clout with senior citizens. Pepper is from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the second-biggest Super Tuesday state. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has ads featuring fellow <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> politician <PERSON> Tip </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker, and has been running a biographical spot in which he stresses his economic accomplishments as governor. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has mounted particularly strong efforts in four states with pockets of ethnic or liberal voters: <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> have focused on the border states that lie near their respective homes of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who bypassed early contests to stress the Super Tuesday states, took out a loan Monday to pay for a media blitz, a campaign spokesman said. `` We're going to saturate Super Tuesday. ... We want to pour it on,'' said press spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s state campaign treasurer in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had taken a $ 1 million line of credit against which money would be borrowed for a 20-state advertising campaign. <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON> said new <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> commercials would go on the air today. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has already made national cable television buys and purchases of time on individual stations in most of the Super Tuesday states. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was first on the air in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where he once lived. He has been running a biographical ad. Republican rival Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> has concentrated his advertising money in seven Super Tuesday states, said his political director, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>. Rarely are the candidates engaging in the small-scale, `` retail'' campaigning of the early contests _ visiting diners, plant gates and firehouses, taking door-to-door strolls down residential streets. When they do, it's mostly for the benefit of television cameras. `` It's too vast a primary to even bother, other than for media events,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON>, a political media expert at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a wholesale day. The candidates have to rely heavily on their strategic consultants and media consultants.'' A well-heeled candidate could spend upwards of $ 2 million blanketing the territory with TV commercials, radio spots and satellite feeds. The trick is to spend shrewdly as well as heavily. `` It's a matter of consultants sitting down with polling data and Census data and deciding where you have your best bet,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON>, a media analyst and co-director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's applied science meets gut political instinct.'' The typical Super Tuesday technique calls for finding targets within states, such as individual congressional districts, and keeping mum about where they are.

<HEAD>New Law Would Outlaw Foreign Funding Of Apartheid Opponents</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The government intensified its crackdown on apartheid opponents today by introducing a bill that would outlaw foreign funding of political activity. The legislation, expected to be adopted during <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s current session, could cripple the operations of anti-apartheid organizations and churches spared during last week's crackdown on major black opposition groups Eighteen groups, including the largest anti-apartheid coalition and largest labor federation, were barred from political activity. The new legislation, called `` The Promotion of Orderly Politics Bill,'' would prohibit all organizations from receiving money from abroad for political purposes. Many anti-apartheid, human rights and religious groups receive the bulk of their funds from overseas. The bill would empower the justice minister to declare certain organizations `` restricted'' and to take control of foreign funds sent to them. Money which is deemed to be earmarked for undesirable political activities will `` either be returned to the foreign source or dealt with as determined by the minister,'' the bill says. No court challenge of the restrictions would be allowed. The funding restrictions could be applied to politically related activities of anti-apartheid church organizations, which have vowed to step up protests because of bans on other groups. The South African Council of Churches, which includes most major Protestant denominations and is deeply engaged in civil rights work, has received more than 90 percent of its funds from abroad in recent years. The <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which cooperates with the council of churches but receives funds separately, also relies heavily on overseas financing. The Rev. <PERSON> Smangiliso </PERSON> <PERSON> Mkhatshwa </PERSON>, secretary-general of the Southern African <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, said the bill might prove difficult to enforce. `` If the church says supporting the families of detainees and paying legal fees is the work of love, the work of evangelism, it is dificult to see how the government can define for the church what it pastoral and what is political,'' he said. Another section of the bill sets a penalty of two years in jail or a $ 2,000 fine for anyone who `` says or does anything'' to foment hostility or violence between of different racial, cultural or religious groups. The penalties would apply to anyone who displays any banner, emblem or slogan deemed to convey such hostility, and also to anyone who attends a gathering where such items are displayed. <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzman </PERSON>, veteran <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> member of the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said she planned to demand a special debate today on the arrests of prominent clergymen who were protesting the government crackdown. About 25 church leaders, including Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, and more than 100 other protesters were detained briefly Monday after riot policeman blocked them from marching to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> with a petition protesting the bans on opposition groups. One of the arrested churchmen, Roman Catholic Archbishop <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Naidoo </PERSON>, said in an interview today that he and his colleagues considered it their duty to continue challenging the government. `` The church has got to take a stand on the morality of the use of political power,'' he said. `` If it being used by a minority for the protection of the minority and the oppression of the majority, then the church has got to point this out.'' In another development, government officials warned the country's largest conglomerate, the <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, that they would not tolerate its announced plan to defy the Group Areas Act _ the law that establishes racially segregated living areas. Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the nation's 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. An executive in <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION>'s property division, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindrop </PERSON>, recently described the act as a sham and said his company was prepared to negotiate leases directly with black tenants renting apartments in the `` white'' <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> neighborhood of <LOCATION> Hillbrow </LOCATION>. Currently, most of the thousands of blacks living illegally in <LOCATION> Hillbrow </LOCATION> are forced to have their leases signed by a third party and are vulnerable to exploitation and threats from their landlords. The government has indicated it might allow <LOCATION> Hillbrow </LOCATION> and a few other areas to become integrated, but it says violations of the Group Areas Act will not be tolerated in the meantime. `` The act still stands until changes are approved by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Piet </PERSON> <PERSON> Badenhorst </PERSON>, a deputy Cabinet minister, said Monday. `` There will be prosecutions.'' Anglo American's stance was praised by foes of the Group Areas Act and denounced as civil disobedience by the extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.

 A former <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Common Pleas judge who presided over what prosecutors called a `` cesspool of corruption'' was sentenced today to 12 years in a federal prison and fined $ 10,000.

He faced a maximum sentence of 120 years in prison and a $ 1.5 million fine. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' lawyers pleaded for leniency because he has diabetes and other ailments. `` I was hoping the sentence would be shorter.

<HEAD>Flight Attendants Still Prepared To Strike; No Talks In Sight</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Only one major issue still separates <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and its flight attendants, who continued working as usual today even though their strike deadline passed last week, company and union officials say. Another union official said there was a possibility that <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> could be faced with simultaneous strikes by the flight attendants and ground workers. A federal mediator is scheduled to hold talks between the company and <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 143 </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> a week from today, said <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, president of that union. If those talks break down and the mechanics declare a strike deadline, the flight attendants, represented by the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>, could invoke their own walkout, <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said he does not know how long the flight attendants can maintain their right to strike or how long it will take for the mechanics to set a strike deadline in accordance with labor laws. `` I think that's the game that is going on right now,'' said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a labor expert at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>. `` If the machinists are going to begin negotiations, it may be to -LRB- the flight attendants' -RRB- advantage to work without a new contract until the machinists take a position. `` The more coordination that goes on, the larger the numbers, the more strength they have in dealing with <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>.'' There are about 6,700 union flight attendants and about 20,000 mechanics, baggage handlers and other ground workers at Northwest. Talks between <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> and Teamsters officials broke off at dawn Saturday after an all-night negotiating session. A strike deadline of 11:01 p.m. Friday passed without a strike and no job actions have been taken against the company, said company spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wren </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wren </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Musto </PERSON> said Monday that there is only one major sticking point in the talks: A company proposal to delay the promotion of workers on a lower B-scale pay schedule to the higher-paid A-scale bracket. All new employees hired since a 1982 contract have started as B-scale employees at pay rates lower than the previous system, <PERSON> Musto </PERSON> said. The 1982 contract called for B-scale employees to jump to A-scale levels in their sixth year of employment, but the company has proposed extending that wait until the ninth year, <PERSON> Musto </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wren </PERSON> said a large number of senior flight attendants make more than $ 40,000 a year, plus meal payments when they're working. Most entry-level flight attendants are making about $ 15,000 a year, he said. About a third of the company's flight attendants are at the B-scale level, <PERSON> Musto </PERSON> said.

 The posh Fontainebleau Hilton Hotel is not liable for the garrote death of a <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> mortgage banker who was killed there five years ago, a jury has found. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Masegian </PERSON>'s body was found by a hotel worker in a stairwell with a 32-inch nylon cord with wooden knobs wrapped around his neck. His widow sued, contending the death could have been prevented if hotel security was better. Defense lawyers told jurors the death was a contract killing that took place in <LOCATION> Masegian </LOCATION>'s room and that the body was dragged to the stairwell. `` This crime was not foreseeable, nor was it preventable,'' hotel lawyer <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> <PERSON> Stansell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> argued. Jurors deliberated about 2 -LCB- hours Monday before deciding the hotel should n't be liable for someone murdered in his room, jury foreman <PERSON> Nora </PERSON> <PERSON> Langford </PERSON> said. `` The incident would have had to happen outside the room,'' she said. Widow <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Masegian </PERSON>, 43, had sought more than $ 1 million for herself and for five of the victim's five children from a previous marriage. Police initially treated Mrs. <PERSON> Masegian </PERSON> as a suspect after uncovering a mysterious telephone message she received at the hotel the day before the killing. However, she was never charged. During the trial, defense attorneys portrayed her as a woman with much to gain from the death of her wealthy husband, who planned to divorce her and leave her with nothing. Because of her husband's death, Mrs. <PERSON> Masegian </PERSON> receives $ 857 a month from her husband's worker's compensation benefits and $ 140,000 from his estate.

 A week before Southern voters assert themselves in the 1988 presidential campaign, Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> paid a call today on former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and said, `` I come here today not to enhance my prospects but to greet an old friend.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> made it clear that with fellow Georgian <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> not in the race he had no plans to endorse any of the Democratic presidential candidates before the nominating convention next July. On one of <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s major issues, the former president also said that he could accept the congressman's trade legislation `` if the president has the authority to moderate any sort of protectionist trends.'' Asked about <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s less than ringing endorsement of a proposal that has been a centerpiece of his presidential campaign, the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said that he and <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> `` shared the view we've got to create a better more open world trade.'' Standing on the front walk in front of his brick home in this small town that he put on the map, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said he thought there was a 50-50 chance that no one will have clinched the presidential nomination before the convention. `` My hope is that out of the primary and caucus season will come a clear winner,'' he said. `` I'm not sure that's a likelihood now.'' The former president said he would attend the convention as a delegate and that if there was a deadlock `` I would not personally favor turning to someone outside the active candidate group for the nomination.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said he has met with all of the active candidates. From <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was flying to <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, to pick up the endorsement of former Govs. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McNair </PERSON>. As the campaign entered the final week before Super Tuesday on March 8, the day 20 states, most of them in the South, hold primaries and caucuses, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> started running a new television commercial throughout the region. The ad takes on Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. In it, Rep. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Leath </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> says <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> `` stood with us for lower taxes, for an oil import fee to make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> strong, for a tough trade bill to stand up for American workers.'' `` On all these issues, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> were opposed to us. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> even think the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> trade bill is too tough on the Japanese, Europeans and Koreans. We're tired of hearing that you ca n't fight for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> anymore. That's why 35 Southern congressman are fighting for <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> for president.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> won favorable comment from several fellow Democrats attending a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> the past two days in <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> is the only candidate who is running a message campaign,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` So he has the benefit of operating almost in a vacuum.'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said he thought Super Tuesday would play a major role in determining whether <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> or <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> survives in the presidential race. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrick </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s campaign manager, said, `` I do n't think it's going to be that definitive.'' <PERSON> Carrick </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> campaign would spend $ 1 million on television advertising during the week before Super Tuesday, most of it in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the two biggest states voting on March 8. <PERSON> Carrick </PERSON> described <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>, who was governor of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> from 1977 to 1985, as a leader of the progressive wing of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the state. He said <PERSON> McNair </PERSON>, who was governor from 1965 to 1971, was a leader of the ore conservative wing of the party. He said their dual backing was `` a nice little bookend endorsement.''

<TEXT>
 A federal judge today cleared the way for enforcement of a federal regulation intended to save endangered sea turtles by throwing out a suit filed by shrimpers who say the rule will ruin their business. Shrimpers said they would defy the regulation, which goes into effect today. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> brushed aside vehement arguments from shrimpers battling the requirement that they use bulky traps called turtle excluder devices, commonly called TEDs, which are intended to eject trapped turtles from nets. `` I do n't care if he upheld it. It's a bad law, and the shrimpers ai n't going to live by it,'' said Tee <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mialjevich </PERSON> of Concerned Shrimpers of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, which filed suit against the law. Critics say the devices do n't always work and that they allow shrimp to escape. <PERSON> Mialjevich </PERSON> said shrimpers in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, where the law has been in effect since Jan. 1, experienced reductions of 35 percent to 50 percent of their catches. The law was also scheduled to go into effect off the coast of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> today. Shrimpers had argued that there was not enough evidence to show that the TEDs would be effective in protecting the endangered turtles. `` A review of the administrative record demonstrates that -LRB- shrimpers' -RRB- arguments are unfounded in most aspects,'' <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> wrote. `` From the outset, the Secretary -LRB- of <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- through the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> collected scientific information from sea turtle experts from states, universities and the private sector.'' <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> had said in advance that his ruling would not determine the usefulness or effectiveness of the controversial devices, but would address only whether the government had followed proper procedures when it imposed the legislation. The outcry against the TEDs spread even to the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, where a law was passed forbidding state officials from enforcing the new regulations. The state attorney general's office had joined the shrimpers' suit, but <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> dismissed the state from the case, saying the shrimpers were capable of speaking for themselves State officials were not sure how they would act. <PERSON> Corky </PERSON> <PERSON> Perret </PERSON>, assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION>, said his department is caught in a `` Catch-22'' situation between state and federal law. `` Until I get some legal, firm position to sit on, I guess I'm up in the air,'' <PERSON> Perret </PERSON> said

 Senators <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., called on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> today to strictly penalize <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries that fail to cooperate with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in its effort to combat drug <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> for a Drug Free America the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration must decide the national security interest of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> before being concerned about <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, particularly <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was to officially announce that <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has failed to cooperate with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but will not impose forceful sanctions in an effort to force the ouster of Central American country's military strongman, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The president also was to reject calls to decertify <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, which have been criticized heavily for failing to cut the flow of drugs to this country. <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON> said many members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> believe the certification process has not been used properly by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Under the 1986 law, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is to decertify and cut off aid to countries `` not fully cooperating'' with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to combat drug traffic.. `` This year, the good news is that <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is on the list,'' said <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON> `` On the other hand, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> are n't. We'll have to examine why <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is certified. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> is a country under siege and we will have to examine that. We have to ask ourselves what is the national interest. I think we have to continue to apply pressure against these countries.'' He said the law will be changed next year to require a bilateral agreement between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nations `` so that there will be a country-by-country certification, rather than one list including all of them. We will tell them in advance what we expect of them and we will be able to grade them on how they do. That will be more helpful to this country.'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> was particularly upset that the administration did not decertify <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, a country that borders on his state of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` How can we delude ourselves into thinking that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> should be certified,'' he said. `` They should not. They have not cooperated fully with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. If we are going to send young drug agents into <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, we should demand full cooperation and not wink at it. The 1986 act spelled out what is to be expected, and it has not been done.'' <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> both said the president relies too heavily on the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for the basis of his certification of a country. `` State is willing to be too tolerant in this area,'' said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narcotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> felt for years that <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> was the primary cause of concern for the nation's drug problem but now `` it seems that we have an entire hemisphere to worry about. The so-called spread of Communist influence is the least of our worries in this region at this point in time.''

 <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s `` beauty contest'' primary today has been largely overshadowed by preparations for next week's delegate-heavy Super Tuesday primaries, political observers say Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ who won the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> caucuses over the weekend _ were considered the front-runners here, continuing to play on their ties to the region. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> native, has a summer home in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Vermont Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> predicted a record turnout of 125,000 voters. Several communities reported strong voting today under sunny skies, but turnout in the state's largest city, <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, was running behind four years ago. Some had predicted that the <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> primary _ falling between the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary and Super Tuesday, March 8 _ would take on more importance this year. But the primary has attracted little attention. `` I think what we're seeing is we're getting jumped by Super Tuesday,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> just got lost in the shuffle,'' said <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a political science professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION>. `` Those timing factors when combined with the fact the <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> primary is a beauty contest ... led to an incredible loss of interest.'' Tuesday's voting does not choose delegates; Vermonters merely state their preferences in the non-binding primary. Delegates to the national conventions will be elected at state conventions, a process that begins in April with local caucuses to elect delegates to the state convention. The candidates sent a lot of surrogates to stump for them, but made few personal appearances. `` We got to see very little of the candidates. We saw their mothers, their wives, their children, but we did n't see much of them,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. Spokesmen for the candidates say attention now is on winning delegates in local caucuses. `` That's our focus, that's where our energy is going even now,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, a campaign coordinator for <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who scored a surprisingly strong second in the weekend <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Democratic caucuses. `` I think there's a recognition that the -LRB- <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> -RRB- primary is the beginning of building for the caucus,'' said <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Yager </PERSON> of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign. But <PERSON> Yager </PERSON> maintains <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> probably gets more attention from candidates than some of the 20 individual Super Tuesday states. `` No single state gets a lot of one-on-one attention,'' she said. Although non-binding, the <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> primary has served an important purpose in past years. In 1980, former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> used a win in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> to embarrass Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., in his own back yard The same year, a strong second-place finish in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> gave Republican <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s campaign a major boost. In 1984, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s overwhelming defeat of <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> helped him shed his image as a dark horse.

 Apparel manufacturing is <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s leader in employment. Besides that, furniture building is centered in the <LOCATION> Tupelo </LOCATION> area, and catfish processing employs people in the Delta. Since the 1960s, manufacturing has employed more people than farming in this state where 70 percent of the people live outside urban areas _ and yet in some recent years the leading source of income in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> was neither. It was government `` transfer payments'' _ Aid to Families with Dependent Children, Social Security, food stamps. `` As the economy becomes more automated, more geared toward people with skills,'' <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON> said, `` you're going to see more people left out.'' Asked the solution, he quoted <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s new governor, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON>: `` Education, education, education.'' Without that, high-technology companies will continue to stay away, agreed <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a lawyer working for the <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>. `` You've got to get them -LRB- students -RRB- enough math and English so that the Vo-Tech can teach them to work for a <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>.'' In rural areas nationally, 18 percent of people fall below the poverty level, about $ 11,200 for a family of four, according to 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> figures. That's the same rate as in inner-cities. `` I do n't think the people who are masterminding this economy are paying attention to this,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zippert </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperatives </ORGANIZATION>, a group based in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> that helps family farmers hold onto their land. `` It's a little like the underclass question of the urban ghetto _ that there's going to be a permanent class that's going to be left behind.'' Left behind is a fitting description. `` In one year, rural areas across the country lost 632,000 people to metro areas due to migration,'' <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., has said `` That's like saying that all of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> migrated in one year.'' Those who leave tend to be the best educated, say officials, lamenting the rural `` brain drain.'' It's not that nothing is being done to address the rural-urban economic restructuring that <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has termed `` just as profound as what was happening in the <LOCATION> Rustbelt </LOCATION>.'' But many observers of the rural poor say the efforts of government are piecemeal and inadequate. Federal funding for a variety of rural development programs added up to about $ 1.6 billion last year, according to a study just completed by the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Change </ORGANIZATION>, a research and advocacy group in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> Those programs included grant and loan programs of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> _ from which <LOCATION> Tchula </LOCATION> received its grant _ and the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> and other departments. `` The funding levels have shrunk radically from what they were at the end of the Carter administration,'' said <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> DeWeaver </PERSON>, who led the study. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's policy has been to decentralize efforts to aid rural development, noted the economic research organization <ORGANIZATION> MDC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, in a report last month. `` The federal government now dictates fewer rules and provides fewer dollars. As a result,'' said <ORGANIZATION> MDC </ORGANIZATION>, `` ... there is a surge of economic and social initiatives in state governments throughout the country.'' Besides a new emphasis on improving education in virtually all Southern states, initiatives cited by <ORGANIZATION> MDC </ORGANIZATION> included: a bank in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> that focuses mainly on rural economic development; innovative literacy projects in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>; and a biracial group in struggling <LOCATION> Noxubee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, that promotes home-grown businesses. Nonetheless, the study cited `` many more dark rural places still lacking the resources, the information, and the encouragement'' to make significant economic progress, and it called for more carefully targeted federal and private-sector help in giving isolated places access to capital and management assistance, education and training. Just outside of <LOCATION> Tchula </LOCATION>, the members of the <LOCATION> Mileston </LOCATION> Co-op know what a little outside help can mean. Sitting in the spare country store that the co-op of black farmers has owned for 40 years, <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON>, the acting president, talked about the donation they received from FarmAid, the charity fund created by country musicians. Some of the members, whose cotton farms average about 50 acres, used the money to pay delinquent taxes or overdue rent on land or old fertilizer bills. `` I can remember one fella,'' <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON> said, `` he had everything, but he could n't get diesel _ so that helped him.'' In the store, the afternoon gathering place now a month before planting time, the co-op members say they could use a different kind of outside help. They'd like to restart their cotton gin, which closed a few years ago because of drought-stricken crops and lack of money _ and they'd like to diversify, maybe open a plant that would process, package and freeze vegetables grown in their fields. A plant like that would employ some of the workers displaced by planting and picking machines. First, though, they'd need the expertise to help ensure profitability, and second, the start-up investment. The idea is not to get rich, the men said, but to employ people and give the next generation a chance to stay here. `` I realize it would n't cure the problem,'' <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON> said, `` but that would help some.''

The price index declined 0.8 percent from January but still averaged 6.6 percent above a year earlier, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said Monday Higher prices for cattle, hogs, corn and soybeans helped soften the declines for the other commodities, however. `` Most commercial vegetable prices dropped sharply from a month earlier as supplies became plentiful,'' the report said. `` Warm weather in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> pushed vegetable crops to maturity.'' But cattle and calf prices `` were the highest since May 1979'' and hog prices rose for the second month in a row, the report said. Corn prices at the farm were the highest since July 1986, while soybeans were the highest in more than three years. Department economists say net cash income of farmers set a record in 1987 of about $ 57 billion. This year's net _ the difference between cash receipts and cash expenses _ may be in the range of $ 50 billion to $ 55 billion. Consumer food prices are expected to rise 2 percent to 4 percent this year, compared with a 4.2 percent average increase in 1987. According to the preliminary February figures, based mostly on mid-month averages, the index for crop prices was down 4.3 percent from January but averaged 11 percent more than a year ago. Commercial vegetable prices dropped 33 percent from January and were down 2.2 percent from February 1987. Sweet-corn prices rose from January, while all other vegetables declined. Lettuce prices dropped to $ 11.90 per 100 pounds from $ 35.60 in January. Feed grains and hay, collectively, showed a 3.2 percent price gain from January, averaging 23 percent more than a year earlier. Corn, sorghum, oats and hay were up, while barley prices declined from January levels. Cotton prices were down 6 percent from January but averaged 22 percent more than a year earlier. The index for livestock and livestock products was up 2 percent from January and 4.2 percent above Februrary 1987. Prices were higher for beef cattle, calves and hogs, which more than offset declines in milk, poultry and egg prices. Prices of beef cattle averaged $ 67.90 per hundredweight, up $ 2.50 from January. Calf prices, at $ 93.10, were up $ 4.90 per hundredweight. Market hog prices rose $ 3.60 from January to $ 47.50 in February but were still below a year earlier. February farm commodity prices averaged 130 percent of a 1977 base used for comparison, according to the preliminary figures, down from a revised January reading of 131 percent. A year ago, the February index was 122 percent. No new figures for farm production costs were included in the report. Those have been confined to quarterly averages because of budget cutbacks. In January, however, farm expenses were up 0.6 percent from last fall but averaged 1.4 percent below a year earlier. The next quarterly figures will be reported in April. The report said: _ Cattle averaged $ 67.90 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally, up from $ 65.40 in January and the $ 58.80 reported for February 1987. Those are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef. _ Hogs averaged $ 46.70 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 43 in January and $ 48.20 a year earlier. _ Corn, at $ 1.83 a bushel, was up from $ 1.77 in January and the average of $ 1.42 per bushel a year earlier. _ Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures, averaged $ 2.83 per bushel, compared with $ 2.75 in January and $ 2.58 a year earlier. _ Rice averaged $ 7.85 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 7.70 in January and $ 3.83 a year earlier. _ Soybeans were $ 5.90 per bushel, compared with $ 5.73 in January and $ 4.69 a year earlier. _ Upland cotton was reported at 57.1 cents per pound, compared with 60.6 in January and 46.4 cents in February 1987. _ Milk was $ 12.30 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 12.50 in January and $ 12.90 a year earlier.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is making some progress but still lags in expanding jobs and services to black Americans, according to a panel's report. In 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> directed all agencies in the department to carry out new guidelines to improve <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> compliance with civil rights and equal opportunity standards. As part of the department's February observance of Black History Month, five study groups looked at how <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> has performed since then. `` Black employees continue a modest but upward movement in all occupational categories,'' the report said Monday. `` Some increases have been realized both in absolute numbers and as a percentage of total <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> employment. This is especially important because the increases have occurred at a time when overall employment in <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> was declining.'' The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> employs the equivalent of approximately 102,000 full-time employees, according to recent budget documents. The task force report said blacks comprise 8.4 percent of the department's employees, up from 8.1 percent in 1986 But that `` is low compared with other federal agencies,'' it added. `` To continue to improve its equal opportunity posture, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> must realize larger increases in the number of blacks hired, promoted and trained,'' the report said. `` And such increases must be realized at a faster pace. Additionally the department must place emphasis on retention strategies once black employees are recruited and hired.'' The task force report said there are `` encouraging signs'' that <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agencies are beginning to address the complex problems of black farmers and their declining numbers. `` Coordinated efforts between the <ORGANIZATION> Soil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Extension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> are just beginning to show limited success at eliminating the historical factors militating against small and economically disadvantaged farmers,'' the report said.

 The Foreign Ministry has lodged a protest with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy over the `` subversive thrust'' of <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> broadcasts on nationalist unrest in the Baltic republics, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. The official news agency charged Monday that <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> reports beamed into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` have been crudely distorting historical facts, making provocative insinuations about the growth of nationalist sentiment in the Baltic republics of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and expressing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for forces that do not accept the social system in this country.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said today: `` The Soviet charges are false. We are covering stories about nationality problems in the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> and elsewhere in the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION> fairly and honestly. We have tens of millions of listeners in the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION> and the Soviet authorities do n't want them to hear the message so they attack the messenger. The complaints are unfounded and we'll just keep doing our job.'' There have been a number of nationalist demonstrations in recent months in the once-independent republics of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government-operated radio has taken a `` dramatically increased subversive thrust'' in reporting on the situation in the Baltic region. The news agency said the protest was made to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The Soviets last May stopped routine jamming of VOA Russian-language broadcasts, but there have been occasional complaints in the official media about information broadcast by the service.

 GOP presidential contender <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> struck at <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in new TV ads today, including one declaring <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supported arms deals with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, as <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> sought Cuban-Americans' support with new talk about missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The biggest delegate day of the primary season is a week from today, and the presidential candidates were swarming across the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, where most of the 20 Super Tuesday states are located. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> started his day in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, but then he, too, headed South, to <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> for more campaigning. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> paid a call today on former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who made it clear that with fellow Georgian <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> not in the race he had no plans to endorse anyone before the Democratic convention next July. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> also said he thought there was a 50-50 chance that no one will have clinched the party's nomination before the convention. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, trails Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in Southern polls, and he began the final week before Super Tuesday with public and televised attacks. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> minority leader accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of offering `` nine different answers'' on the Iran-Contra affair. `` But it's a fact he did support it,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, meanwhile, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said today a transcript of 1967 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee testimony supports his belief there are nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The former television evangelist quoted testimony from a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official who said <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> refugees had told him about seeing missiles. `` This is documented evidence,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said today at a breakfast attended by about 600 supporters. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has denied his contention about missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, which he first made in a debate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> last month. <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> began its non-binding `` beauty contest'' primary today under sunny skies with a record turnout predicted and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the governor of neighboring <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, the Demcratic favorite. On the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> side, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who won <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> caucuses, has a strong organization in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has won endorsements from some top Republicans. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was campaigning in another pre-Super Tuesday state _ <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, which holds its primary Saturday. As he did in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, the vice president brought in former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>, a hero to conservatives, to stump for him. Polls have given <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a comfortable lead in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, but he said he was taking nothing for granted. `` Two days before <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, some of the most respected pollsters showed me down and almost out,'' he said Monday in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won the Feb. 16 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary by a solid margin, after polls suggested rival <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was breathing down his neck. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, on a Southern swing that took him to <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, heaped scorn on the vice president, characterizing him as a passive figure. `` Ask him what's he done in the last seven years,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said at a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> rally. `` What's he done anywhere in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> or the world to make a difference?'' Continuing that theme, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> unleashed a television ad which depicts the vice president walking through the snow without leaving any footprints. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s campaign said the commercial was having a test run in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and other selected cities. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Monday, produced a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> refugee who he said had seen missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The Cuban, who spoke through an interpreter and identified himself only as <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, said he had seen missile sites, but did not know whether the weapons had nuclear warheads. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> also told Cuban-American senior citizens he would work with them for an independent and democratic <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. `` Viva <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> Libre!'' he said. At a mostly Hispanic high school, he called <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> a `` butcher and a tyrant.'' Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> rivals <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, who have been trading victories in the early caucuses and primaries, traded jabs at a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> debate in <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ridiculed the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman for `` running around the country beating up on the establishment'' while accepting political contributions from special interest groups <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> was also critical of the practice. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> called it `` an affront'' to suggest that such contributions would influence the way he votes in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. During the debate, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he has sometimes been singled out for different treatment during the campaign because of his race. He cited an exit poll in which voters were asked if they would support a black candidate for president. `` I said, did you ask how many would vote for a Greek?'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, referring to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who is of Greek descent. `` My race is self-evident and my leadership is obvious.'' Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> visited racially troubled <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and drew a comparison with white-ruled <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> people have been abandoned by the law. No law protects them,'' he said. `` What is happening right here ... is a whole body of people has been abandoned by the law.'' He made the same comparison in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, where he walked through a trash-strewn neighborhood. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> suggested city officials want to force poor residents out and redevelop the property, likening it to the South African government relocating blacks. He told college students at <ORGANIZATION> Pembroke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> that his strong second-place showing in the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> caucuses proves he has broadened his appeal. `` Talk about mainstream; try the state of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>!'' he said. At Monday night's Democratic debate, at <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s suggestion, the candidates wore yellow ribbons on their jackets in protest of the arrest of Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The government Tuesday defended a treasure hunt at a historic Spanish fort and extended the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contractor's digging permit for another month. On Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved a resolution calling for a halt to the search for Japanese treasure believed buried at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, which was active during the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> occupation that ended in 1898 and later was used by the Japanese as a garrison during World War II. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action followed a speech by opposition Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>, who said the search was being conducted `` by foreigners whose only reason for being here is perhaps their greed for gold.'' Enrile charged it was an insult to national honor. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Precious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concern, began excavating this month at a chamber in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> for gold believed buried there by Japanese soldiers at the end of World War II. The company has agreed to give the government 75 percent of whatever is recovered. National Security Adviser <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Soriano </PERSON>, who is monitoring the project for the government, told reporters Tuesday the government approved the company's request to extend the dig for 30 days. The contract would have expired this week. `` Nothing is going on right there in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> that would desecrate the national shrine,'' <PERSON> Soriano </PERSON> said in response to <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>'s speech. He said <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> had known of digging at the same site when he was defense minister under President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> in 1975 but had not moved to block it. <PERSON> Soriano </PERSON> said the dig was an `` authorized and legitimate project of which the beneficiary would be the Filipino people,'' and that the contractors would restore the excavated portions of the fort. <PERSON> Soriano </PERSON> said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDougald </PERSON>, an official of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company, had reported they expect to recover gold bullion believed hidden in the fort within 10 to 15 days. The treasure hunt was widely publicized after two Filipino workers were killed last week when a tunnel they were digging collapsed. <PERSON> Soriano </PERSON> said his company would give the equivalent of $ 5,000 to each to the families of the two workers. Work has since resumed, with troops now guarding the site around the clock. <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Gemiliano </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, who inspected the site Tuesday, said the dig was about 17 feet deep.

<HEAD>Bennett Gets Friendly Capitol Hill Reception With New Spending
Proposal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> on Tuesday to promote his education spending proposal for 1989 and found a friendlier reception than in past years, when he was seeking cuts. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is asking for $ 21.2 billion in education spending authority _ about $ 850 million or 4 percent above the current level. `` This is a bill that should go through the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in one hour,'' Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Natcher </PERSON>, D-Ky., chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee on labor, health and education, told <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> `` I would imagine the seat that you're sitting in is quite a bit cooler than it has been in the last few years,'' added Rep. <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Conte </PERSON>, R-Mass. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> laughed and denied <PERSON> Conte </PERSON>'s assertion that he had undergone a conversion and become a `` born-again education spender.'' `` I'm the same old mad Catholic I always was,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said the education request was as high as possible under the outlines of the deficit reduction agreement reached last year between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration. That agreement limited overall domestic spending increases to 2 percent. The proposed 4 percent education hike is `` way above average,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. `` This is pretty much to the limit of what we could in good conscience ask for.'' <PERSON> Natcher </PERSON> questioned <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> closely on proposed cuts in certain types of student loans, a public libraries program and grants meant to offset tax losses in areas with federal installations. He hinted the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> might not go along with those cuts but promised <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, `` We're going to bring you out a good bill. We're going to bring out a bill that both you and I will like. The administration has proposed expansions in a number of programs, including <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> grants to needy college students, aid to disadvantaged children, magnet schools and a college loan program under which repayments are pegged to future income. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has consistently appropriated more for education than the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has sought. The fiscal 1989 education increase is only the second one requested by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. The first came in 1984, another election year. Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, D-Wis., pointed that out in a statement and noted that `` our kids go to school every year, not just election years ... Local school boards need help that is n't turned on and off with election cycles.''

 Sodium cyanide pellets were spilled on a snowy section of Interstate 80 because of a truck wreck, and nearly 100 miles of the highway was shut down as a small amount of deadly cyanide gas formed. A nearby rail line crossing the unpopulated area was also closed for a time. State Motor Vehicles Director <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Teglia </PERSON> said a tractor-trailer rig overturned seven miles east of <LOCATION> Battle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>, injuring the driver and spilling about 100 pounds of pellets. Some gas formed when the pellets, used in mining operations, reacted with the wet snow, <PERSON> Teglia </PERSON> said. `` If it had been raining it would have been worse,'' said <PERSON> Teglia </PERSON>. He said clean-up crews from the trucking company, <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cargo </ORGANIZATION>, and a mining company were dispatched to clean up the spill.

 It would be counterproductive to create a new, independent agency to oversee safety at federal nuclear weapons materials facilities, a top <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> official to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. But Rep. <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON>, D-Wash., urged the subcommittee to approve legislation creating such a watchdog agency, calling the department's plan to establish an advisory committee `` an inadequate response. DOE operates 40 major facilities in 34 states, including reactors that produce plutonium and tritium and plants that refine it for use in nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON>, a DOE undersecretary, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> procurement and military nuclear systems subcommittee it would be `` premature'' to create an outside agency. `` The advisory committee needs time to work, to prove its credibility,'' <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON> said. The DOE official said a new agency would be `` regulatory, counterproductive and adversarial'' and could `` severely hamper the department's ability to perform its national security and energy research missions. <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON> has introduced legislation that would create a Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Agency. It would have the authority to shut down any reactor or plant that was found unsafe. A new agency would cost between $ 6 million and $ 10 million a year to operate and funds could be taken from current DOE safety oversight programs to pay for it, <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON> said. The administrator of the agency would be appointed by the president and confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON> said that <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> was caught between the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>'s demands for nuclear materials and the need to operate the facilities safely. `` Studies conducted in recent years have revealed disturbing evidence that <PERSON> DOE </PERSON>'s defense facilities are not only operating with deteriorating and unpredictable equipment, but receive oversight through a poorly managed and ineffcient safety assurance process,'' <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Backs Immigration Officials on Deportation Appeal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday made it easier for immigration officials to deport aliens who seek reconsideration of their claims to remain in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. By a vote of 8-0, the justices barred further hearings for a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> physician, Dr. <PERSON> Assibi </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abudu </PERSON>, who said he might be tortured or killed if forced to return to his native <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Abudu </PERSON> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> for asylum in this country after it denied his initial bid to avoid deportation. Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, writing for the court, said immigration officials, having decided an alien should be deported, generally are under no duty to reconsider the case when the alien says he has new evidence to support a bid for asylum. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said aliens seeking to reopen their deportation cases have the difficult task of proving that immigration officials abused their discretion in refusing reconsideration. `` There is a strong public interest in bringing litigation to a close as promptly as is consistent with the interest in giving the adversaries a fair opportunity to develop and present their respective cases,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said. He continued, `` We have no hesitation in concluding that the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> did not abuse its discretion when it held that <PERSON> Abudu </PERSON> had not reasonably explained his failure to apply for asylum prior to the completion of the initial deportation proceeding.'' <PERSON> Abudu </PERSON> is a native and citizen of <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION> who graduated from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> medical school and married a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen. Immigration officials moved to deport him in 1981 after he was convicted in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> of illegally attempting to obtain the drug demerol by fraud. He was given a one-year suspended prison sentence and was placed on probation for three years. The Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> found him deportable, and the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld that decision. He faces deportation to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, according to court papers. But <PERSON> Abudu </PERSON> said he might be barred by that country and forced to return to <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Abudu </PERSON> asked immigration officials to reopen his case in 1985 and grant him asylum in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from the military dictatorship of Flight Lt. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rawlings </PERSON>, who regained power in <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION> in a Dec. 31, 1981, military coup. <PERSON> Abudu </PERSON> said he had new evidence that his life might be in danger if he was forced to return to <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> refused to reopen <PERSON> Abudu </PERSON>'s case, noting that <PERSON> Abudu </PERSON> did not initially seek asylum when he contested his deportation. But the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 ordered the board to reconsider granting <PERSON> Abudu </PERSON> asylum. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> agreed with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration that the appeals court should have deferred to the immigration board. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who only recently joined the court, did not take part in the decision. In other developments, the court: _ Declined to decide yet whether the state or the federal government should control a Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> area off <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s southwestern Rejecting arguments by the state's lawyers, the court ruled 7-0 that more information is needed before such a determination is made. _ Heard arguments over the constitutionality of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' death penalty law A ruling is expected by July.

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Roger </PERSON>, the alligator who was flushed into the <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON> sewer system as a baby and lived a pampered life in his own solar home at the city water treatment plant, was buried Tuesday.

He lived in a fenced compound that included a solar-heated home, diving pond and grass knoll for sunbathing. The alligator's body was found at the compound at the bottom of his pool. He apparently had gone for a post-hibernation swim. No necropsy was scheduled but officials suspected the alligator died of pneumonia. State Sen. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, who was city manager at the time <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> was adopted, recalled the alligator was fond of frogs. `` There were months where there was n't a live frog in this town,'' <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said. `` Kids found out that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> liked frogs _ live frogs _ and they'd go out and find them, then throw them over the fence of his compound.''

 The judge presided in the banquet room at the Quality Inn.

Such incongruous scenes have been taking place in <LOCATION> Titusville </LOCATION> this week as judges, prosecutors, clerical workers and other county employees moved out of the <LOCATION> Brevard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Courthouse </LOCATION>, which was closed because of asbestos contamination. County officials quarantined the courthouse Saturday when air tests showed asbestos levels far above federal standards in several rooms. Some levels were considered dangerously high, and most employees were urged to get medical tests. Asbestos was widely used for insulation and fireproofing until the federal government banned its use in 1979. The county clerk's office set up shop in modular buildings in the courthouse parking lot. Workers wearing breathing masks hurried to build a plywood and plastic `` cocoon'' to provide safe access to the clerk's computers inside the courthouse. All documents were locked inside when the courthouse was evacuated. Experts said all paperwork and even many computer terminals were contaminated and would have to be carefully dusted and cleaned as they are removed piece-by-piece from the building. The closing of the court house also affects real estate transactions, court-ordered child support payments and other operations.

 Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> should be removed from office for obstructing an investigation of an alleged death threat, senators were told today during opening arguments of the first-term Republican's impeachment trial. But a defense attonrey for <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> told senators in an impassioned statement that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was the victim of a `` mutiny'' by the state attorney general and director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION>. Prosecutor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON> said the man accused of making the alleged threat, former state official <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, had claimed that jobs in the <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> administration `` relate to the amount of money that you were able to bring into the campaign.'' French said the evidence was `` overwhelming'' that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> violated criminal laws and his oath of office and committed malfeasance in office, `` any one of which call for impeachment.'' However, defense attorney <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Craft </PERSON> told senators in his opening statement that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> broke no laws and was acting within his authority. `` What has this man done?'' Craft said. `` There's something wrong in this state when you can depose the constitutionally elected officer of the state and throw the book at him ... based upon evidence that's being presented by people who have a stake in the outcome to have him ousted.'' Craft said the accusations resulted from a `` mutiny'' by Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION> includes the Highway Patrol and investigative personnel. Craft also said he would present testimony that would cast dubt on <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>'s integrity. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who also faces a March 22 criminal trial and a May 17 recall election, did not appear at the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on the second day of his impeachment trial. The impeachment counts against <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> include an allegation that he ordered <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> not to cooperate with the attorney general's probe of an alleged death threat by <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, then the state prison construction chief `` There was an obstruction with regard to an ongoing investigation that was being conducted by the attorney general's office,'' French said <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> has denied making a threat against <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, a former top <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> aide who testified before the state grand jury on <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s failure to report a $ 350,000 campaign loan. DPS Officer <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, a former member of <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s security detail who was called as the trial's first witness, testified this morning that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> administration official <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> told him about a conversation she had with <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> said <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> had told her that if Ms. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> `` did not keep her mouth shut, she could wind up taking a long boat ride ... and I know the right people who can help me,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> testified. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said that he met with <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>, other <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION> officers, <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> and several assistant attorneys general several days later and that <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> told of a conversation he had with <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> told the group that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> `` stated he did n't want him helping the attorney general.'' `` The overall mood was just amazement,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> testified. Craft said <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> and other officials did not fully advise <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> about the alleged threat, adding that <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> `` was a feckless employee of this state and he did not serve that governor well.'' French said <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> complained about the job he was given by <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> and told Corrections Director <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, `` If they do n't treat me right I can bring <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s administration down. French warned the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to `` keep your eye on the ball'' and not be distracted by any attacks on witnesses in the case. `` Know that this is being done because there is no defense,'' French said. The opening arguments today dealt only with the alleged threat. Arguments will precede discussion of the other allegations against <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> as they are reached during the trial. On the trial's opening day Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> strongly rejected efforts to dismiss impeachment charges against <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. Also, the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was expected to rule today on a defense claim that the impeachment trial, the first of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governor in 59 years, should be delayed until after <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s March 22 criminal trial on charges of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan. The high court last week refused to grant a temporary delay, and <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said he planned to take the issue to federal court if necessary. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunasek </PERSON>, a Republican, said `` it was the first-day jitters for everyone'' in the impeachment trial's opening day Monday. `` It crosses everybody's mind _ the importance to do justice to the governor and the state,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Usdane </PERSON>, also a Republican. `` It's a large burden and we take it seriously.'' Senators refused to dismiss the 23 articles of impeachment against <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, whose attorney, <PERSON> Jerris </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, entered an innocent plea on his behalf. On 11 separate motions, the largest number of the 29 senators voting for dismissal was seven. Several senators said the vote should not be considered an indication that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is likely to be convicted, saying they want to hear the evidence first. However, Sen. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, a Republican who has strongly backed <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, said the governor's conviction was virtually a foregone conclusion. `` I think that it's not likely that he's going to prevail,'' he said. If convicted by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> would be removed from office and could be permanently barred from holding elective office in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, 63, won election in a three-way race after five tries. He has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and insisted he will survive both trials and a May 17 recall election and return to the office he gave up to acting Gov. Rose Mofford, a Democrat, when he was impeached by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 5.

Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Senatore </PERSON> said he would appeal <PERSON> Ryskamp </PERSON>'s decision to the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, and the judge granted a temporary stay of his release order. Even if the appeals court upholds <PERSON> Ryskamp </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> also can not be released until his lawyers convince the INS. `` We of course have a detainer on him and would be holding him on an immigration violation,'' said <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> district director <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> has targeted <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> for exclusion hearings and possible deportation because he entered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> without legal immigration documents last month after his release from a Venezuelan prison. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials have said they will not permit <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>'s release and have labeled him a terrorist because of his conviction for conspiring to bomb the Polish ship. Parole officials also accused him of consorting with known criminals. On the probation commission order, <PERSON> Ryskamp </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rast </PERSON> went beyond the facts on record to conclude that <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> should be held. The judge said <PERSON> Rast </PERSON> apparently considered <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>'s acquittals in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> as a strike against him and wrongly considered `` reported'' past associations of <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> with known criminals. `` If that's going to be the basis of denying somebody their liberty rights, then it's a sad day for the Constitution,'' said <PERSON> Ryskamp </PERSON>. The judge also noted that <PERSON> Rast </PERSON> evidently reviewed information in <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>'s parole file which was never disclosed to <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>. The judge also noted that <PERSON> Rast </PERSON> ignored the recommendation of a probation officer who interviewed <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> and concluded there was no risk that he would flee. <PERSON> Ryskamp </PERSON> set bond at $ 250,000 and said that if <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> is freed he can not make public appearances or statements or identify himself with any militant groups opposing the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government of <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. He also could not receive more than five visitors in his home at any one time and would be required to report in three times a day by telephone.

 Pick a political persuasion and there is no doubt a party for it in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, a nation so philosophically fragmented that even groups committed to political unity are split into factions. The nation's major opposition parties _ all 21 of them _ are boycotting Thursday's elections to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, but there certainly is no lack of election interest. As many as 102 political groups are vying for the 330 seats. Many, obviously, are quite small. `` One has to use a microscope or a telescope to see if they are really political parties,'' says <PERSON> Shamsul </PERSON> <PERSON> Huda </PERSON> <PERSON> Haryn </PERSON>, a political science professor at <ORGANIZATION> Dhaka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Sorting out the groups in the parliamentary fray is difficult because one group on the ballot is known as `` the 23-party alliance'' and another is listed as the `` combined opposition party,'' which is made up of 73 separate factions. Whatever the number, the parliamentary contest illustrates just how fractured the political system is in this nation of 105 million people. A government booklet on the country's `` multi-party political system `` notes that the `` polycentric political system in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> has marked a phenomenal fragmentation of existing organizations and growth of new ones.'' The booklet gives the history of 130 separate political parties. Some experts, however, believe there many be more than 200 separate political groups. Included in the political patchwork are 11 different Islamic parties, reflecting the predominant Moslem population, along with six <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> parties, a <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and two Republican parties. There are even two separate <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>'s parties. <PERSON> Harun </PERSON>, who studied in both <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>'s political groups are not really parties as defined in the West. `` Call them pressure groups, or lobbies, or even sections,'' he said. <PERSON> Harun </PERSON> said that many have no cohesive philosophy and were formed around a single issue, tending to split or fall apart once the issue waned. That politics is a passion here is evident in the grim toll it often takes. At least eight people have died in the past two weeks of parliamentary campaigns. In local elections Feb. 10, more than 100 were killed, according to government figures. The election Thursday was prompted by a campaign by the 21 opposition parties to topple President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>. After more than 20 general strikes called by the opposition since Nov. 10, which included 25 deaths in police clashes with mobs, <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> dissolved <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in December and ordered a new election. The opposition groups, however, have vowed to boycott it. Those groups are the self-proclaimed `` eight-party alliance'' led by <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON> of the Awami league, the `` seven-party alliance'' headed by <PERSON> Khaleda </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, a group known as the `` five-party alliance,'' and the Jamaat-e-Islami, the largest Moslem fundamentalist party. Diplomats and political observers say the <ORGANIZATION> Awami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> is the best organized. It was founded by <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mujibur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON>, the country's first president who was assassinated in a 1975 coup. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>, 58, is a former general who took power in a coup and became president in 1986 in an election his opponents say was rigged. They say Thursday's balloting also will be rife with fraud. The Bengalis were noted for their passion for politics even in the days when <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> was ruling the subcontinent. <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> was <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> during British reign, then <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> after the partition of the subcontinent in 1947. It gained independence as <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> in 1971. While theories abound on why politics here is so splintered, some say the Bengali people are by nature a divisive people. As one oft-repeated saying goes: ` Two Bengalis equal a political party, three equal a party plus one faction.''

<HEAD>Some of Reagan's Simplest Lines are Scripted for Him by Aides</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, pretty fast with an ad-lib or quip, has many of his daily lines finitely scripted, ranging from the `` Welcome to the House'' greeting to the `` God Bless You'' sendoff. One of the president's recent meetings _ a brief session known as a `` drop by'' in the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Room </ORGANIZATION> with several corporation executives _ was scheduled to last 20 minutes. For that get-together, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was provided with the following `` Sequence of Events:'' _ ` 11:30 a.m. _ You enter Cabinet Room, are introduced by Senator <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and deliver remarks. At the conclusion of your remarks you open the meeting to discussion. _ ` 11:47 a.m. _ <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Range </PERSON> will signal the end of the official portion of the meeting. _ ` You move to the end of the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Room </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- under President <PERSON> Coolidge </PERSON>'s picture -RRB- for handshake photos with the participants. _ ` 11:50 a.m. _ You depart.'' In the briefing paper provided for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 30-minute meeting with leaders of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who had recently met with <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> allies about the arms control treaty signed in December, the president was reminded, among other things, to say: `` Bob -LRB- <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> -RRB-, I appreciate you and your colleagues coming down today.'' A 20-page package of these briefing papers, obtained by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>, was made available to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The unintended disclosure of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s talking points left <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides red-faced, with Communications Director <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Griscom </PERSON> maintaining that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> often ignores these scripts anyhow. At least part of the reason for this embarrassment is that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> long has been considered by political observers to be too heavily scripted by his aides. The president, a former actor, generally is relatively quick with responses to questions raised by reporters during picture-taking sessions and during chance encounters. Though he often is seen cupping his ear because of difficulty in hearing the questions, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is fairly adept at answering them when he chooses to do so. The package of talking points included remarks prepared for outside visitors to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, ranging from singer <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> to an interview with <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON>. Absent from the package were any comments prepared for the president's daily top-level staff meeting or national security briefing. Some White House staff members dismiss the disclosures with a laugh, contending the paperwork is similar to that provided other high administration officials or corporate officers and is nothing more than the product of an overzealous staff. `` I think the insinuation that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> needs to be told to say ` Goodbye' or ` God Bless You' is a cheap shot,'' said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s domestic policy adviser, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>. `` Anyone who's around the president frequently knows that the best stuff he says at meetings are the things he comes up with on his own. It's unfair and silly to insinuate that he ca n't function without those papers,'' said <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>. `` It's little worker bees who have little jobs to do,'' said <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON>, press secretary to first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. White House communications director <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Griscom </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ignored the scripted dialogue during the meeting. He said such texts are given to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> only to `` refresh his memory,'' if necessary. `` He knew what points he wanted to make, so he did n't use the talking points at all,'' <PERSON> Griscom </PERSON> said. `` Is it so unnatural for a staff person to tell his boss about a meeting he's arranged, that these people are coming, this is what we're doing?'' <PERSON> Griscom </PERSON> asked. `` He has n't got the time to sit there making notes about what each little meeting's supposed to be about _ he has more important things to do.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> argued that some White House staffers are so eager to do their jobs correctly that they include items and remarks that are actually taken for granted by the official involved, including the first lady. `` Both she and the president know to say, ` Hello, how do you do,''' Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said. Besides, she said, `` show me a -LRB- television -RRB- correspondent who does n't use a script.''

<HEAD>Koop Concerned About Spread Of AIDS Virus Among Teen-Agers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel Tuesday he is concerned about the spread of the AIDS virus among teen-agers and expressed outrage at suggestions the disease can not be spread through heterosexual intercourse. Reiterating his call for sex education programs beginning at the elementary grade levels, <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said, `` I think it is quite possible to raise a generation of adolescents down the road that would be far less sexually active than the present one.'' He emphasized that such programs should involve parents and incorporate moral and social values along with anatomical studies. But in the best of future worlds, he said, `` that leaves the teen-agers of today.'' `` Many people are discouraged about teen-agers because some of them are so sexually active,'' he said. While it is important to recommend abstinence, <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said, `` I think it is also realistic to understand that sexually active teen-agers are unlikely to reverse their pattern and go backward, and therefore prevention for them has to be our third line of defense. ... `` We have to teach them about the protection of themselves and others through the use of condoms and spermicides. `` I know that goes against the grain of many people in this country,'' he continued, `` but we can not abandon more than half of our teen-agers because they are sexually active. And we have to reach them where they are and tell them about those things they have to do.'' Although only a relative handful of the more than 50,000 AIDS cases reported so far involve teen-agers, <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said little information is available on the extent to which the virus may be lying dormant among that group. Because of the long incubation period of the disease _ five years or more _ <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said he is reluctant to rule out an outbreak of AIDS cases in young heterosexual adults who contracted the virus as teen-agers. Largely because of that concern, <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> criticized some press accounts that have suggested there is virtually no danger of AIDS being spread through vaginal intercourse. `` We know from the infected spouses of persons with hemophilia that -LRB- this virus -RRB- can be spread through normal vaginal intercourse. What concerns me is the potential for a more rapid spread ... into the general population,'' he said. `` I am outraged at recent newspaper and magazine articles stating that there is no danger of heterosexual transmission from normal vaginal intercourse,'' said <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>. `` Although homosexual sex and IV drug abuse are the principal modes by which most cases are transmitted, it is just not true that there is no danger from normal vaginal intercourse. `` What is unknown is the level of danger. There is always a danger whenever people engage in casual sex.'' He did not mention any specific articles, but other <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials _ responding to specific queries _ have criticized a recent article in a magazine aimed at young single women which downplayed the risk of acquiring AIDS through intercourse. <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> was the main witness Tuesday as the 13-member commission began three days of hearings into some of the most controversial aspects of AIDS, including education and prevention. Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who has differed publicly with <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> about the emphasis to put on advising sexually active people to use condoms, is scheduled to testify Thursday. Retired <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Adm. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said Monday he is confident that the commission can reach consensus recommendations on such controversial topics by the time it submits its final report to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> June 24. Responding to questions at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> a day before <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>'s testimony, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> also called attention to the concern of health authorities that little is known about the rate of dormant AIDS infection among teen-agers. `` We do n't know what it is in adolescents,'' he said. `` There may be lurking on the horizon a real problem that has yet to unfold.''

 Here is a transcript of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s remarks as he left Tuesday for the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit meeting in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> Thank you all very much, and good morning. I'm going to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to meet with a group of friends and colleagues, the leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>. We and our foreign affairs and defense ministers see a good deal of each other, just as friends should. But the meeting that begins in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> tomorrow will be special. It will be the first time in almost six years that leaders of all the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries have met together for a summit. Much has happened in those six years that we can be very proud of, including the INF Treaty with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that removes an entire class of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear weapons, weapons that on the Soviet side have held the European continent at risk. That historic agreement was possible because the alliance's steadfast political and military resolve backed up our negotiations with the Soviets But the purpose of this summit is not self-congratulations. Our responsibility is to the future, and it will be to the future that we turn our attention tomorrow. Our first priority is to maintain a strong and healthy partnership between <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, for this is the foundation on which the cause of freedom so crucially depends. We will never sacrifice the interests of this partnership in any agreement with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s agenda for peace and freedom has always been ambitious, and it must remain so. In the arms control area, we will continue to press for Soviet agreement to 50 percent reductions in the strategic nuclear forces on both sides, and for a truly global and verifiable ban on chemical weapons. My colleagues and I will be working to give negotiations on conventional forces a new start as well. We will also discuss Soviet behavior toward its own citizens and toward other countries, since problems of human rights and external aggression remain key obstacles to long-term improvement of East-West relations. If our common approach to the East over the years has given coherence to our message of peace and world freedom, it has been our unwavering commitment to defend ourselves that has given it credibility. Arms reduction can only succeed if it is backed up by a strong defense. My <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> colleagues and I will rededicate ourselves to maintaining the deterrent that has protected our freedom and prosperity for almost 40 years. I will repeat to my colleagues my strong conviction that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops will remain in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, under any administration, so long as Europeans want them to stay. We can be rightfully proud of these 40 years of peace that our common commitment has brought. But the job is not finished. We in the alliance will not be satisfied merely with a record period without war. We seek nothing less than permanent peace with freedom in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. This bold objective can be obtained, but we must have the courage to follow the course that we have set for ourselves. For four decades, a combination of a strong common defense and pursuit of dialogue with the East has been a winning formula for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. It is a combination that can lead us to a future of peace, freedom and prosperity for generations to come. Thank you. God bless you. And thank you all for coming out here to see us off.

<HEAD>Curfew In Effect in City in Azerbaidzhan Where Rioting Broke Out</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL PUTZEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities have clamped a curfew on a southern city where weekend rioting broke out and tensions are still running high because of a territorial dispute between ethnic groups, a Soviet official said Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> suggested that the Sunday unrest in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, as well as demonstrations and other violence elsewhere in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> region in which at least two people died, were due to `` mistakes'' made 65 years ago when a territory composed largely of Armenians was made part of neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION>. He told a government news briefing that `` there were certain injuries'' in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, an industrial city of more than 160,000 people in <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION> where hooligans were blamed for touching off the Sunday riot. `` The situation is calm there today, but it is tense,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. The official was peppered with questions about the civil unrest in the southern Soviet republics of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Azerbaidzhan </PERSON> at his regular Tuesday news briefing, but he said he had few details about events there. Moscow-based foreign journalists have been barred from the region, and only sporadic reports from witnesses, activists and the official media have reached the Soviet capital. `` When passions calm down and life starts to normalize, the appearance of some journalists in this region can lead to intensification of nationalistic feelings,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said, explaining why restrictions have been imposed to keep correspondents from visiting the area. Asked about reports that Soviet tanks are patrolling the streets of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, that ethnic Azeris are attacking Armenians in the streets, and that there have been at least two deaths in the city, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said, `` There is a curfew.'' He said he had not heard anything about tanks being sent to the city. Asked if troops remained in the city Tuesday, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said, `` I do n't know, but I guess so. Presumably.'' The violence in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, reported Monday by the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, followed earlier outbreaks 150 miles away in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, the contested region in <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION>, and massive but apparently peaceful demonstrations in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. The demonstrators demanded that <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, which has been part of <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION> since 1923, be made part of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. About three-quarters of the region's population of 157,000 are ethnic Armenians. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said he did not have detailed reports from the entire region but that what information he had indicated `` everything is calm'' in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> and surrounding areas. `` The events that took place caused great concern to us,'' the spokesman said. `` We think it is not a proper way to settle the problems that have accumulated.'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> acknowledged, however, that the unrest apparently stemmed from `` some mistakes made in national relations, and these mistakes should be rectified.'' Soviet authorities have pledged to reconsider the issue of whether <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> should remain part of <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>'s remarks seemed to indicate the region would be turned over to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. He did not, however, say when that might occur. Asked if he was indeed saying <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> should be made part of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, the spokesman said, `` I meant there were some mistakes in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> described the region as `` a kind of enclave'' in <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION> with 49 nationalities represented among the population that is nonetheless mostly Armenian. `` That is why we should be very tactful in handling this question in order not to cause differences between brothers and nationalities. The previous policy had some mistakes in this area,'' he said. On Saturday, a Soviet prosecutor reported that two people living in a region of <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION> that borders on <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> had been slain in unrest caused by the territorial dispute. On Friday, Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> appealed for `` civic maturity and restraint'' in <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, and promised that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> would review relations among the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s more than 100 nationalities. That same day <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also met with two prominent Armenian writers to help work out a solution to the problem over <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. Azerbaidzhan is the largest of three Soviet republics in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION>. It is bordered on the west by largely <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armenia </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and on the north by the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Caspian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> runs for nearly 800 miles along its eastern edge. The republic is mainly Shiite Moslem, except for Armenian Christians living in the Nagorno-Karbakh region.

<HEAD>Singer Brian Wilson's Psychologist Accused Of Drug, Sex Misconduct</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 State medical authorities want to revoke the license of a psychologist who has been Beach Boy <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s therapist, alleging the man financially exploited the eccentric songwriter In documents released Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assurance </ORGANIZATION> accused psychologist <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Landy </PERSON> of drug violations, patient sexual abuse and `` grossly negligent'' conduct. Seven causes of action were filed against <PERSON> Landy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s near-constant companion for the last five years The accusations largely concern <PERSON> Landy </PERSON>'s relationship with <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, saying multiple business relationships with <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> caused the singer `` severe emotional damage, psychological dependence and financial exploitation.'' A request for comment was left at the office of a spokesman for <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Landy </PERSON> on Tuesday but there was no immediate response. Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, representing <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, said the accusations were false. `` <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> has made a miraculous recovery with the help of Dr. <PERSON> Landy </PERSON>, psychologically, physically and financially. He's in the best shape he's ever been in his life,'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Landy </PERSON> has said he became a virtual 24-hour guardian of <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> to save him from obesity and a dependence on drugs and alcohol that left him cloistered in a sand box in his house for a year. In a 1983 interview in <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Landy </PERSON> said his staff controlled <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s every moment, monitored everything he ate and drank and recorded everything he said. The medical board said <PERSON> Landy </PERSON> abused his privileges as a psychologist by serving as <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s business manager, business adviser, executive producer and co-songwriter while also as a therapist. Last year, the Beach Boys formed a management advisory committee to make business decisions. The state board said <PERSON> Landy </PERSON> used his influence over <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> to be picked as the singer's representative, and was paid $ 140,000 for serving on the committee for 11 months. Also questioned was <PERSON> Landy </PERSON>'s control of <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s prescription drugs for a five-year period. Psychologists are not permitted to prescribe drugs. The board said <PERSON> Landy </PERSON> would have <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> examined by a physician who would prescribe medications that were kept in <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s home in a locked cabinet. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> did n't have a key, but <PERSON> Landy </PERSON>'s unlicensed assistants did. <PERSON> Landy </PERSON> was also accused by the board of using cocaine and amyl nitrate with an unidentified female patient to induce her to have sex with him. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> McCready </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the board's <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> office, said the next step in <PERSON> Landy </PERSON>'s case is for the state attorney general to schedule a hearing before an administrative law judge, which usually takes six months. The judge would make a recommendation to the board's psychology examining committee, which will determine what action to take. Ms. <PERSON> McCready </PERSON> said if <PERSON> Landy </PERSON> disagrees with the committee's decision he can appeal to <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Pro-choice groups filed 229,128 signatures Tuesday in support of a statewide vote on whether <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> should continue to pay for poor women's abortions. That gave the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Choice </ORGANIZATION> coalition more than 100,000 names above the minimum needed to put the issue on the Nov. 8 ballot and suspend a new law that will halt welfare abortion funding beginning March 29. However, the petitions may have been filed too late to avoid a temporary funding cutoff. `` We have every reason to believe that 29 days is enough time'' to confirm the required 119,829 valid signatures and put the law on hold, said <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Frey </PERSON>, speaking for the coalition. `` I would find that very unlikely,'' responded Elections Director <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. He said election-year petition certification normally takes 45 days to 60 days. Both <PERSON> Frey </PERSON> and Right to Life of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Listing </PERSON> said they were confident the signatures will be certified. `` It's a large pad. It's certainly enough to, I think, place it on the ballot,'' Listing said. Both sides have estimated the statewide campaign to sway referendum votes will cost $ 2 million to $ 3 million. The petition drive that ended Tuesday was the second in as many years dealing with welfare abortion funding. Since 1978, Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, a Democrat, and his Republican predecessor, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Milliken </PERSON>, have used their veto power 17 times to preserve state-paid abortions for the poor. Right to Life initiated the no-funding law last year with a petition drive intended to avoid the veto. In <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, anyone who can gather 191,726 valid signatures can place before the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> a measure that, if approved by both houses, becomes law without the governor's signature. After gathering about 400,000 signatures, the Right to Life-written proposal breezed through the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> and became law. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> is one of 14 states that uses taxpayer money to finance abortions for the poor. In 1986, the most recent year for which a final tally is available, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> paid about $ 5.8 million for 18,600 abortions.

<HEAD>Disciplinary Actions Against Doctors Increase</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The states took disciplinary action against 1,277 of the nation's half-million physicians in 1986, but a consumer group that compiled the figures said Tuesday that too many doctors are still getting away with shoddy work. The actions taken in 1986 represented a 17 percent increase over the previous year and contrasted with a 46 percent jump in disciplinary actions from 1984 to 1985. `` Even though the 1986 total ... is better than in any previous year, it falls very short of catching most of the incompetent doctors in this country,'' said a report by the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> founded by <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> and director Dr. <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>. `` In most states, the majority of disciplinary actions are for drug and alcohol problems, only a fraction being for incompetence,'' it said. `` The absence ... of the maximum effort to discipline doctors is one of the most serious threats to the health of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> patients.'' Although the federal government can suspend doctors from participating in federal health programs such as <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and Medicaid, the underlying permission to practice medicine is determined solely by the individual states. Surveying data from the Federation of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boards </ORGANIZATION>, Public Citizen ranked all 50 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> according to the number of 1986 `` serious actions'' per 1,000 doctors. A serious action was defined as a revocation or suspension of the license to practice medicine, or a probation. The national average was 2.37 actions per 1,000 doctors. <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> led with 6.94 actions per 1,000, followed by <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> was in 51st place with none. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> ranked 50th, preceded by <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> in 40th place. Nationwide, the group found there were 745 serious actions in 1984, 1,089 in 1985 and 1,277 in 1986, the last year for which figures from all localities were available. `` Since there is no evidence that doctors settle in certain states depending on how competent they are, differences in the rate of doctor discipline reflect differences in how serious states are about disciplining doctors,'' the report said. `` We continue to believe that until the rate of doctor discipline in this country significantly increases, there is no realistic possibility of a major decrease in the amount of medical malpractice.''

 A county supervisor who prides himself on doing right by his district and recently offered $ 1 to any constituent who spotted a pothole, has issued a $ 5 bounty on flooded intersections. `` Whether I pay off one or two, it'll be the best survey the <ORGANIZATION> Flood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> ever had,'' said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, who is running for an unprecedented 10th term. `` It'll keep the <ORGANIZATION> Flood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> engineers out of their offices in downtown and down in the streets where they belong,'' he said.

<HEAD>Haughey Challenges British Army's View of Civilian's Shooting
Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> on Tuesday challenged the British army's contention that one of its soldiers accidentally shot and killed an unarmed civilian from an observation post just inside <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. `` A suggestion that death was due to a freak accident of an extraordinary kind must give rise to disbelief,'' <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON>'s administration launched its own investigation into the Feb. 21 shooting of 23-year-old <PERSON> Aidan </PERSON> <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON>, which strained already tense relations between <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. An Irish police officer said he witnessed the shooting from across the border. Police in the British-ruled province charged an 18-year-old soldier with unlawful killing. He is being held in military custody. The army said the bullet that hit <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON> ricocheted after being fired accidentally from an observation post at a checkpoint near <LOCATION> Auchnacloy </LOCATION>, less than half a mile from the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>'s border Relatives said <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON>, a campaign worker for <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the legal political arm of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, had been harassed by the British army. His sister, <PERSON> Eilish </PERSON> <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON>, claimed her brother had received a number of death threats from the army. <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON>'s inquiry angered the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> government and <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> political leaders in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, who see it as interference in their affairs. <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> said the Irish investigation was obligatory because of the `` considerable concern'' over the incident among the province's Roman Catholic minority He said <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON>'s death, along with the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> government's refusal to prosecute <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> police officers who killed six unarmed Roman Catholics in 1982 and the release from prison of a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> soldier who served just three years of a life sentence for killing a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> `` have combined to create the impression that the security forces are above the law. `` Any such impression among the public in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> must have disastrous consequences on the community and impinge on every aspect of British policy for the administration of justice in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON>'s body was exhumed Sunday after his family requested an autopsy by an Irishman in addition to that held by the British in the north. The family said they wanted to determine the course of the fatal bullet. He was later reburied in the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> announced today that <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and three other countries long hostile to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> _ have not cooperated with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to stop the smuggling of drugs to American markets. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> plans no steps to penalize <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> economically beyond measures already taken, said <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Wrobleski </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official responsible for narcotics matters. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will `` wait and see'' if <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military-dominated government improves its cooperation before deciding on additional sanctions, she said. The decisions concerning <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> will have no economic impact on them, partly because none is a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid recipient. Under law, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is required to suspend all economic and military aid to countries found not to be cooperating in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug enforcement efforts. Ms. <PERSON> Wrobleski </PERSON> noted that all such aid to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was suspended in 1987. Such a finding also requires the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to vote against loan requests by the offending country in international lending institutions. Ms. <PERSON> Wrobleski </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been abstaining on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s requests for some time and that, in any case, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has no loan applications pending. Ms. <PERSON> Wrobleski </PERSON> raised the possibility that the administration may increase tariffs on Panamanian products if that country's attitude on drug-smuggling does not improve. She said a contributing factor in the decision on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was the drug-smuggling indictments handed down a month ago against military strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The indictment said <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has become a major transit point for U.S.-bound cocaine from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> certified that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> are cooperating with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug enforcement efforts, but Ms. <PERSON> Wrobleski </PERSON> said the president indicated that `` these countries should do more.'' Under a 1986 law, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is required to take punitive measures against countries found not to cooperate in curbing drug-smuggling to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Countries which are `` decertified'' are subject to the penalties. Today was the deadline for the announcement of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s findings. The announcement on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s lack of cooperation in drug enforcement carried heavy political overtones, given the dramatic developments over the past few days. The administration has refused to extend recognition to the new Panamanian government which took office following the ouster last Friday of President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was deposed by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s allies in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> after the president tried to fire the defense chief. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration continues to look on <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s constitutional president The new government has named a U.N.-based envoy to replace <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s ambassador, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> refused to relinquish the embassy. The appointed successor, <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kam </PERSON>, showed up at the embassy on Monday and left after what he said was a `` frank'' exchange with <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., introduced a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> resolution urging additional economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, including a trade embargo An administration official, however, said the government is not contemplating any such action. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s resolution also asks that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> cut off all contacts with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> because he is `` no longer the lawful commander'' of the Defense Forces. In a brief speech on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` is a threat to peace and security in the region.'' `` When a drug trafficker gets control over the governmental powers of a nation, it's a threat to other nations,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said the administration should go much further than it has in pressuring <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down. `` This business of let's go slow, let's exercise restraint and caution, that is what has produced the situation. We've been going cautiously with this gangster for 20 years,'' <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Presidential candidates scrambled to discredit their rivals with increasingly rough-and-tumble television commercials a week before the nation's biggest primary day ever. Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> scored Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his role in the Iran-Contra affair in one new ad. In another, Rep. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Leath </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> criticizes two Democrats competing against his colleague, Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. The candidates under attack _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> _ all have produced hard-hitting TV ads of their own and were expected to respond promptly. Television is shaping up as the candidates' most important tool in the far-flung Super Tuesday contests on March 8. There are 712 Republican delegates and 1,307 Democratic delegates up for grabs that day in caucuses and primaries in 20 states and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>. Super Tuesday stretches across more than 150 media markets and more than 500 television stations, with a multi-million dollar price tag for any candidate who wanted to clog the air with commercials. Most of the contenders were targeting their media spending to carefully selected areas where they thoguht they had the best chances of winning delegates. Both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> predicted they would in the end have spent the most for Super Tuesday; <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had the most money in the bank as the contest approached. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> were first out of the box with negative ads. One <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> spot depicts someone walking through snow but leaving no footprints. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> said the message is that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` has held all these big jobs'' yet left no mark. Another ad, the first to inject the Iran-Contra affair into the campaign, says <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was `` opposed selling arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supported the arms-for-hostages deal.'' The ad also accuses <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of waffling on taxes, taking a soft line on the U.S.-Soviet arms control treaty, and opposing a textile bill popular in several Southern states. In his ad on behalf of <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Leath </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman `` stood with us for lower taxes, for an oil import fee to make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> strong, for a tough trade bill to stand up for American workers.'' `` On all these issues, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> were opposed to us. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> even think the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> trade bill is too tough on the Japanese, Europeans and Koreans. We're tired of hearing that you ca n't fight for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> anymore. That's why 35 Southern congressman are fighting for <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> for president,'' <PERSON> Leath </PERSON> says in the ad. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> also is using a slightly retooled version of a commercial that gave him the edge he needed to beat <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> last week in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. The ad called <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` one of the biggest tax raisers in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> history'' and mocked the governor's suggestion that struggling <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> farmers switch to growing Belgian endive The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign has prepared several tough responses, including an ad that shows a weathervane swinging back and forth as a narrator accuses <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of flip-flops on issues. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON>, the campaign's communications director, declined to provide any scripts because he said final decisions on what would be used, when and where had not been made. But he said the general content would be along the following lines: `` He says he is leading the little guy's fight but his campaign is financed and supported by the big guys. His biggest contributors are <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s biggest corporations. He has failed to show a set of principles or a set of values that give a rudder to his policies.'' In a footnote to the fierce Super Tuesday TV campaign, Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, began attacking <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> in ads running on radio stations in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. The state holds a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary on Saturday. The <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> ad asks if the former television evangelist has `` the qualifications and the judgment to be our next president'' and cites some of his more unusual positions such as a 1979 suggestion that public schools be eliminated. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> later changed his mind. In addition to negative ads, the candidates are using more subdued biographical spots and traditional political testimonials. Among them: former Sen. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> endorses <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> praises <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, and Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON> _ an elderly <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> legislator with enormous clout among senior citizens _ speaks kindly of <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> is also using the <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> ad credited with putting his campaign message into sharp focus and helping him win last month's <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses In the spot he criticizes <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for putting stiff tariffs on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> autos and asks how many Hyundais the Koreans could sell here at $ 48,000 apiece.

<HEAD>Court Hears Arguments Challenging Texas Death Penalty Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' capital punishment law, under which some 260 convicted murderers are awaiting death by lethal injection, was challenged Tuesday in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, a lawyer representing death row inmate <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, argued that the law, as applied, stacks the deck in favor of death over life in prison. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said the jurors who sentenced <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> for the 1975 murder of a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> nurse were prevented from giving full consideration to `` mitigating circumstances,'' those factors suggesting life in prison as the appropriate punishment. `` Consideration of particularized mitigating circumstances was not allowed,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> contended. But <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zapalac </PERSON>, an assistant state attorney general, urged the justices to uphold a federal appeals court ruling that said <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> was sentenced properly. Noting that <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> was allowed to present any mitigating evidence he desired, <PERSON> Zapalac </PERSON> added, `` <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> can not reasonably claim that the jury could not see the relevance of the evidence he wanted to present.'' Under <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law, capital case sentencing juries are asked two questions: whether the murder was committed deliberately and whether the killer poses a continuing, violent threat to society. If the jurors unanimously find beyond a reasonable doubt that the answer to both questions is `` yes'' a death sentence is imposed. But <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> told the justices that the judge's instructions to jurors at <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION>'s trial, similar to those typically used in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, directs the jury to consider all mitigating evidence in light of the two questions. For example, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said the fact that <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> had been a well-behaved prison inmate for seven years could only be used to consider whether he was a continuing threat to society and not for some other reason. Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, no relation to the lawyer, asked <PERSON> Zapalac </PERSON> why such evidence could not be used by jurors to decide that <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> was a man of good character `` who should not die.'' <PERSON> Zapalac </PERSON> said <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> failed to show that any other kind of jury instruction would have helped him. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> was convicted of abducting and killing 27-year-old <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>. His lawyer repeatedly said Tuesday he was not attacking the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s 1976 decision, in a case called <PERSON> Jurek </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, that upheld the state's death penalty law. But the justices seemed skeptical that overturning <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>'s sentence could leave the 1976 ruling intact. Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> suggested that <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' arguments appeared to be `` cutting into <PERSON> Jurek </PERSON>. Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> said it seemed to him that the argument came down to whether `` the language of the statute'' did not allow full and independent consideration of mitigating circumstances. If the court were to rule that way, its decision could affect all <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> death row inmates. Out of about 2,000 death row inmates nationwide, 260 are in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. That total is second only to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, which has about 280 inmates on death row. A number of executions have been postponed in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> pending the court's decision in the case, which is expected by July. The case is <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> vs. Lynaugh, 87-5546.

The foundation has worked 11 years to get the exhibit funded, and plans to raise $ 1.5 million more from private sources for additional renovations on the sixth floor of the former <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schoolbook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depository </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Warren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> determined that <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> fired at Kennedy from the sixth floor of what is now the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION> on Nov. 22, 1963. The contract award was approved by a 3-2 vote Monday to <ORGANIZATION> Thomas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hayman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which could begin work as early as this week. The exhibit, `` The Sixth Floor,'' will be reached via an outside elevator that will carry an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 visitors annually to the exhibit without disrupting work inside. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Callaway </PERSON>, a partner in the architectural firm of <LOCATION> Hendrick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Callaway </LOCATION>, said construction could be completed by November. Foundation officials say they are unlikely to schedule the exhibit's opening Nov. 22, the 25th anniversary of <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s assassination `` We think it would be inappropriate,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said.

 Peace talks on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> open their most crucial and fragile phase on Wednesday, one that is widely hoped to produce a settlement to end a conflict that has claimed more than a million lives. But complex and potentially disruptive issues remain to be resolved during the United Nations-sponsored talks before a package of agreements, drawn up during almost six years of bargaining, finally can be completed. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> has said the new round of talks will focus on closing the gap between the varying timetables for withdrawing an estimated 115,000 Soviet troops. But likely to dominate the talks is a question that is formally outside their scope: Who will be in charge in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> until all Soviet troops have moved out? Delegates from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> both said Tuesday that they have come to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to finalize a settlement to end the 9-year-old conflict. But <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Zain </PERSON> <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> said his country would decide next week whether it was prepared to sign the peace package with the present Marxist government of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, which it does not recognize. <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is continuing to press for the formation of a transitional government to coincide with the withdrawal of Soviet troops. Without it, he said, there can be no peace. But he said `` we have come to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> with a constructive attitude to finalize the text'' of the four-agreement package. Meanwhile, the head of the Afghan delegation, foreign minister <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON>, told a news conference that he was looking forward to the new round with a `` sense of full optimism.'' The present leadership, he said, were `` not ambitious'' about retaining power. He said the timetable for the withdrawal was `` within negotiable range.'' The negotiations have come under mounting pressure since Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> announced Feb. 8 that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will withdraw its troops beginning on May 15 if a final deal is sealed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> by March 15. He said the withdrawal could be completed in 10 months. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> originally demanded that the troops quit in three months but has gradually widened that span to eight months. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> wants the settlement to include the transitional government because it could oversee the safe return of more than 5 million anti-Soviet Afghan refugees, one-third of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s pre-war population <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of creating last-minute obstacles to an accord and said the makeup of the government should be left to the Afghans. The alliance of Pakistan-based Afghan resistance groups, claiming to represent 200,000 Moslem guerrillas, responded last week by revealing its own plan for a government. It has ruled out any power-sharing with <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> but offered a minor role to `` Moslems presently living in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>,'' a formula that could refer to moderates in the present government. <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalis </PERSON>, chairman of the seven-group alliance, vowed the guerrillas wo n't lay down their arms until the `` Islamic government'' is set up. Predictably, that concept has been rejected by <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON>, who heads the Afghan delegation in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> says he represents the `` only legal government in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> which has been recognized by 80 countries.'' <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> so far has not given its formal support to the guerrilla proposal and has hinted it prefers a more broad-based approach. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which along with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is to guarantee implementation of the peace package, has been ambivalent in its reaction to the calls for an interim government. But the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, in a non-binding resolution Monday, urged formation of an interim government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> that is acceptable to the Afghan resistance. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Undersecretary of State <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON>, visiting <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> last week, said the guerrilla plan was a `` very welcome step towards the resolution of the Afghan problem.'' There has also been a lack of clear signals on when <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> would be prepared to cut off its aid to the guerrillas, reported to have been about $ 700 million last year. The Afghan monarchy was overthrown in 1978 and a communist government was installed. The Soviets intervened at the request of the embattled new Marxist government.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was greeted by officials of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, and reunited with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, as he arrived today for a summit with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies. About seven hours after pledging that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will keep its troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> `` as long as Europeans want them to stay,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 jetliner touched down on a windy, moonlit tarmac at <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zaventem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. He smiled and chatted amiably as he was greeted by <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who had just arrived from a meeting in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>. Also on hand was <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s prime minister, <PERSON> Wilfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tindemans </PERSON>. Following a five-minute courtesy get-together with <PERSON> Tindemans </PERSON> in an airport salon, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was ferried by motorcade for an overnight stay at <LOCATION> Chateau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stuyvenberg </LOCATION>, a 1840 brick and stone palace one used as the favored residence of the <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> royal family. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, as he left the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> for a two-day <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, said the session comes at a historic moment for both East and West. `` For four decades, the combination of a strong common defense and pursuit of dialogue with the East has been a winning formula for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` It is a combination that can lead us to a future of peace, freedom and prosperity for generations to come.'' A throng of teen-age participants in the White House Conference on a <LOCATION> Drug-Free </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, brought to the diplomatic entrance to give <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> a sendoff, sang `` God Bless America'' as the president emerged. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> attempted to calm allied fears that the U.S.-Soviet treaty banning medium-range nuclear missiles portends an American abandonment of its long-time commitment to the European democracies. `` That historic agreement was possible because the alliance's steadfast political and military resolve backed up our negotiations with the Soviets,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies are also concerned that the force of 326,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> might be cut due to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic budget crunch. `` My <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> colleagues and I will rededicate ourselves to maintaining the deterrent that has protected our freedom and prosperity for almost 40 years,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` I will repeat to my colleagues my strong conviction that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops will remain in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, under any administration, so long as Europeans want them to stay.'' As the first full-scale <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> summit since 1982, the meeting has been touted as a chance for the 16-nation alliance to evaluate its goals and accentuate its solidarity. But the summit, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, will not be held for `` self-congratulations.'' Instead, he said, it will be a time for a rededication to the democratic goals that forged the alliance in 1949 in the face of the spread of Soviet influence in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` If our common approach to the East over the years has given coherence to our message of peace and world freedom, it has been our unwavering commitment to defend ourselves that has given it credibility,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` Arms reduction can only succeed if it is backed up by a strong defense.'' His first priority, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` is to maintain a strong and healthy partnership between <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> pledged anew to forge ahead with attempts to achieve a 50 percent cut in strategic nuclear arms, as well as a global ban on chemical weapons. He asserted that he also intends to press the Soviets on human rights violations and its `` external aggression, `` apparently a reference to its involvement in nations such as <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The summit meeting comes as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> prepares for an expected round of spring summitry with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, and as the allies must cope with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> public relations campaign that paints <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as a champion of peace and arms control. For the most part, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will appear only in brief photo opportunities at the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> session. The meetings among the heads of state or government Wednesday and Thursday will be private. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is slated to deliver closing remarks on Thursday. On Monday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> previewed his slant on the summit in an address to the annual convention of the American Legion. He promised to forge ahead with attempts to cut superpower strategic arsenals in half and to seek a ban on chemical weapons. But he also pledged that negotiations to reduce <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> conventional forces will receive equal weight. `` The serious imbalance of conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> must be addressed as an equally high priority,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact tanks and artillery far outnumber our own. Ours are positioned for defense, theirs for an offensive attack.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> attempted to sweep aside European doubts about <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s willingness to help its friends, but he advised that the alliance can not stand still `` The <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact's numerical superiority and the Soviet strategy which emphasizes surprise attack means that our remaining nuclear forces are fully capable of supporting <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s flexible response strategy,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` At the same time we must modernize our chemical weapons to deter Soviet first-use and we must provide for conventional forces that are capable of protecting free <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said.

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has failed to stop the heavy influx of illicit drugs into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a group of congressmen told a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> conference on drugs Tuesday. Sen. <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., said the administration has earned nothing more than a `` C'' grade for its efforts in the so-called war on drugs Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, chided administration officials, including President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, for claiming the battle against drugs was being won. `` If we are winning the war on drugs, I wish the commanders would go out and tell it to the troops in the field,'' <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> said, drawing a standing ovation from a cheering crowd of about 2,000 at the White House Conference on a <LOCATION> Drug-Free </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` It's tragic to believe we are winning this battle against drugs when we have n't even fired the first shot,'' said <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, who is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narcotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He and six other members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> criticized the administration, as well as their own colleagues, for not taking such actions as sanctions toward <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> countries who do not cooperate with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> in trying to combat drug trafficking. They urged the creation of a drug czar to oversee the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> anti-drug efforts, the use of military forces for the interdiction of drugs from <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> countries and the mandatory, random testing of railroad employees. <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON> were joined at the Congressional Forum of the five-day White House drug conference by Sens. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo., and Reps. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> English, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> The conference, which was required by a 1986 anti-drug law, is bringing together drug abuse experts who will submit a final report and recommend solutions to the president and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this summer. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> told the enthusiastic crowd: `` We need to get away from a policy of containment. We want you to come up with a plan for victory. Let's fight it like we fought World War II, not like <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Let's fight to win.'' <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> and several others praised the role first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has played during the past seven years in her anti-drug campaign, `` Say No to Drugs.'' `` Thank God, we have <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> said. `` She is the only voice we have in this administration. We have no domestic or foreign policy on drugs. If you want to fight this war, you have to put up the resources for the boys in the front lines.'' <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> also said there has been a lack of resources assigned to the the battle against drugs. `` Nothing is a bigger threat internally or externally than the use of drugs,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` We have to focus on the problem and set priorities before it engulfs us completely.'' <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> also urged <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to impose severe sanctions against Latin American countries, particularly <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, if they refuse to cooperate with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in combatting drug trafficking. Under the 1986 law, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is to decertify and cut off aid to countries `` not fully cooperating'' with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to combat drug traffic. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> decided Tuesday that <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> have not cooperated with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to stop the drug smuggling to American markets. But <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Wrobleski </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official responsible for narcotics matters, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> planned no steps to penalize <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> economically beyond measures already taken. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> certified that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> are cooperating with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug enforcement efforts, but Ms. <PERSON> Wrobleski </PERSON> said the president indicated that `` these countries should do more.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will `` wait and see'' if <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military-dominated government improves its cooperation before deciding on additional sanctions, she said. The decisions concerning <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> will have no economic impact on them, partly because none is a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid recipient. <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON> said many members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> believe the administration has not used the certification process properly. `` This year, the good news is that <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is on the list,'' <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON> said. `` On the other hand, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> are n't. ... I think we have to continue to apply pressure against these countries.''

 Construction spending fell 2.9 percent in January, the biggest decline in 10 months, reflecting widespread weakness in all sectors of the building industry, the government reported Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said construction spending fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 395.2 billion in January following a revised 0.4 percent advance in December. Economists said the decline was bigger than expected and will likely mean that construction will be a drag on overall economic growth in the first quarter of 1988. `` What was surprising about the figures was how widespread and pervasive the weakness was. Virtually every category from housing to industrial to hotels and motels did poorly in January,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumichrast </PERSON>, an economist and publisher of a construction industry newsletter, said he expects housing starts to fall by about 15 percent this year and non-residential construction to drop by 10 percent `` I have n't found any area in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with strong housing activity. The only strong area is public construction, which I think will rise by about 4 percent,'' <PERSON> Sumichrast </PERSON> said. The January decline was the largest since a 3.3 percent drop in March 1987, but some analysts said unusually severe weather in January may have contributed to the decline. Residential contruction fell 2.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 191.3 billion as construction of single-family homes fell 2.2 percent and multi-family construction dropped 6.4 percent. Analysts said single-family construction will strengthen in coming months because of recent mortgage-rate declines, but they forecast further declines in apartment building because of continued high vacancy rates. Non-residential construction fell 2.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 90.9 billion, reflecting declines in office construction, hotels, factories and shopping centers. Government construction spending was off 4.9 percent in January to a rate of $ 74.3 billion. The weakness in the public sector was led by a 3.9 percent fall in the largest government construction area, highway building, which declined to $ 24.8 billion.

 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s preoccupation with the Vietnam War and with the POW-MIA issue is hurting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, three <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> specialists said Tuesday after returning from two weeks in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. They described a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> that is changing from a closed society dependent on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to a country more open to the West. The specialists said that if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not take advantage of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s new openness, it could cede influence in the region to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must reassert itself in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Chauncey </PERSON>, a professor of history at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` If it does n't we will be left behind in what will be a realignment of political and economic forces.'' `` We have to stop letting the past determine our actions in the region,'' said <PERSON> Brantly </PERSON> <PERSON> Womack </PERSON>, professor of political science at <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Emotional topics like POW-MIA issue are just red herrings.'' <PERSON> Chauncey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Womack </PERSON> were joined by <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakeman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a professor of history from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, in their call for a more open policy toward <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wakeman </PERSON> urged increasing educational and business contacts with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` In the long run our stakes in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> are enlarged by our training of the technocracy,'' he said, noting that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> now has 20,000 students studying in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The three specialists along with a fourth `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> hand,'' <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Rand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>, spoke at a briefing sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Henry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which supported their trip from Dec. 29 to Jan. 11. Seven American <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> specialists took part in the voyage, which included stays in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, once known as <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>, and talks with high-ranking Vietnamese officials. For the first time, <PERSON> Womack </PERSON> said, Vietnamese officials, including Foreign Minister and Vice Premier <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON>, are talking about <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s foreign policy in a `` post-Cambodian future.'' <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in December 1978, kicked out the Chinese-backed <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and installed a puppet government in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>. A stalemate ensued in <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION>, with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on one side and a resistance coalition, lead by Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the free-market countries of <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> on the other. Last year <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> split with the coalition and began direct negotiations with <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, prime minister of the Vietnamese-backed government. <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Linh </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Vietnamese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, is pushing for economic change in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, where the average annual income hovers around $ 125. He has recognized the need for foreign exchange and investment from the West. <PERSON> Wakeman </PERSON> said South Korean officials told him that both they and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> want to invest in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> because of its disciplined, inexpensive labor force. Ever since the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> withdrawal from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> policy in <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> has been `` reactive,'' following the lead of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> or the capitalist countries of <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, such as <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Chauncey </PERSON> said. `` American officials who I've talked to express a deep-seated bitterness against the Vietnamese,'' <PERSON> Chauncey </PERSON> said. `` It's like, ` They beat us so we'll let them stew in their own juice.''' Other American officials, <PERSON> Womack </PERSON> said, think too much of the issue of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> prisoners of war and soldiers missing in action. `` This issue is important to Americans at home,'' he said. `` But it's hurting American interests abroad.''

 A proposed electronic encoding system designed to prevent music from being copied by new digital audio tape recorders is flawed, the government said Tuesday in a report that boosted efforts to introduce the new machines in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` There is no reason at this point why manufacturers should not be selling'' digital recorders in this country, said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> of the Home Recording Rights Coalition. But recording industry officials promised to sue any manufacturer that tries to sell the machines in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> before the copying issue is resolved, either legislatively or through industry negotiations. Digital audio tape, or DAT, recorders can make copies of compact disc recordings without discernible loss of quality. The recording industry fears that such high-quality copying would cut into their compact disc profits. DAT recorders costing about $ 2,000 were introduced last year in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. But manufacturers have held off bringing them to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where pending legislation in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would require DAT recorders to contain an anti-taping chip that would prevent home recordings. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, a DAT manufacturer, said the study's results would not effect the company's decisions on when to introduce the recorders in <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We're not rushing to market,'' <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said. He said <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> would have to evaluate the availability of software and other factors before deciding when to sell the recorders in this country. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> asked the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> to study an encoding system proposed by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> in which a narrow band in the upper mid-range frequencies is removed from a recording. A DAT recorder equipped with the anti-taping chip detects the `` notch'' and disables the machine's recording circuitry for a short period. The study found that the system is flawed because it does n't always work, the `` notch'' can sometimes be heard by listeners, and the system can be bypassed `` for about $ 100 by a competent electronics technician. `` It's like selling you a camera that wo n't take certain pictures,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>, director of the bureau's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, describing the encoding system. <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> said the effect of the notch on the recordings `` is subtle. Sometimes you can hear it and sometimes you ca n't.'' When the notch is discerned, it is often recognized as a missing note, he said. The bureau's testing team did n't study other anti-taping methods, he said. He added that while `` there are any number of ways'' of altering a recording to prevent copying, `` none of them is going to be fool proof.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recording </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> said the results of the study were a victory for the consumer and signals the end of the legislation before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The coalition has been fighting all anti-taping efforts as infringment on the rights of consumers to make recordings at home, for their private use, of records, tapes and compact discs. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Recording </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, questioned aspects of the study but said it virtually kills the CBS copy-code system `` as a viable political solution.'' But he said the recording industry remains committed to finding a solution through `` negotiation, legislation or litigation.'' <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> said his is a $ 5 billion a year industry that is losing $ 1.5 billion a year to home copying.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Tuesday he would n't `` get into the gutter'' and respond to attacks by his Republican presidential opponents. As the Super Tuesday collection of 20 primaries and caucuses draws near, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> toured the South and acted the part of front-runner. `` I have tried to wage an honorable campaign and I'm not going to get into this gutter answering every single attack,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told supporters outside his <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> campaign headquarters downtown here. `` I want this nomination to be worth something after I win it and, believe me, I'm going to win it.'' `` I support the president. I have nothing to say about <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s charges, nothing at all,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said later when asked by reporters to respond to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> criticism that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has changed his version of the Iran-Contra affair repeatedly <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> began his day-long swing through south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, scheduled to end in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> with a foreign-policy lecture to political science students at <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. He also briefly addressed a rally at the state university. `` Things are going well but I am taking absolutely nothing for granted. I am convinced that whoever wins Super Tuesday will be the next president,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at the campus, where one of the introductory speakers was `` Miami Vice'' co-star <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Talbott </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also was joined for his trip by former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>, the 1964 Republican presidential nominee, and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> stepped up criticism of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in commercials and speeches that say <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has accomplished nothing of significance and questioning <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s role in the Iran-Contra affair. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the students that he was in charge of two meetings in which the 1983 <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> invasion was planned and he said he had helped form and head the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Drugs that began seven years ago. He expressed pride in the <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> invasion, saying: `` Kicking <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> out of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> was a very good thing.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said although there have been some slight improvements in relations with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s regime, he said there was no reason to expect a change in policy toward <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> because he continues to `` support and export revolution.'' At the campus rally, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took note of placards denouncing the new U.S.-Cuban immigration accord that calls for normalized immigration of Cubans in return for the return of Mariel boatlift Cubans. Many in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s large Cuban exile community, which numbers more than 600,000, have said they strongly oppose sending any Cubans back to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pledged that Cubans would not be treated in the same way as immigrants from other countries because they are fleeing oppression. Later in the afternoon, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> drove a paving machine at the construction site of a development called <ORGANIZATION> Mystic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pointe </ORGANIZATION>, which will have 1,600 units for sale at an average $ 100,000 price. The project is adjacent to the prestigious Turnberry Isle development, which was mentioned in the national news last year when <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> model <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> disclosed she took a chartered trip to <LOCATION> Bimini </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> from the marina there in a yacht called the `` Monkey Business.''

<TEXT>
 A proposed free-trade agreement between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> will leave the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> auto industry at a competitive disadvantage, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee Tuesday. `` Thousands of American auto workers' jobs would be at risk under the agrement's terms,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckman </PERSON>, international economist for the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>, in testimony before the trade subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Witnesses at the hearing, including a representative of auto parts makers and the state of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, center of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> auto manufacturing, gave a mostly negative evaluation of the treaty's effect on the auto industry The only witness who gave unqualified praise to the treaty was <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vehicle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` The agreement takes on and resolves most of the trouble spots which were developing in the bilateral auto trade,'' he said. Criticism of the pact, which seeks to eliminate nearly all tariff barriers between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, centered on the failure of the treaty to eliminate present areas of discontent on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side. `` Our current bilateral auto trade is skewed, to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s benefit, by a number of trade-distorting practices,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Sander </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., resulting in part from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s domestic-content requirements and duty rebates on some <PERSON> Beckman </PERSON> said that by retaining Canadian production incentives for <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION>, the treaty provides `` a subsidy of Canadian production, much of which will be sold in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>'' <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON>, however, downplayed the union's worry, saying the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> auto industry already has excess manufacturing capacity. `` <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s duty remissions programs ... are eliminated or phased out -LRB- in the agreement -RRB-,'' he said. `` It makes no sense for the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> government to lure more foreign auto investment, especially when much of the production would be headed for the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. market.'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadrich </PERSON>, director of governmental affairs and international trade with the <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accessories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the treaty was `` a lopsided agreement that sanctions long-standing Canadian protectionism.'' <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Santucci </PERSON>, trade adviser to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, told the subcommittee the free-trade agreement would benefit the state in some areas, such as access to Canadian electrical power and services resulting from increased trade. `` While important, these benefits can not compare to the magnitude of trade in automotive products,'' <PERSON> Santucci </PERSON> said. `` It is my view that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration sacrificed a critical opportunity to make significant changes in the terms of automotive trade to its imperative of getting an agreement,'' he said. For example, he said, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s duty remissions program on auto parts, designed to foster Canadian production, have been declared illegal under international trade agreements, yet the incentives will continue through 1997 for exports to third countries, allowing inroads by Japanese and Korean manufacturers.

 A sting operation caught 52 suspects who allegedly operated a $ 100 million poaching ring which dealt in tiger, bear, sea lion and rhinoceros parts, state officials announced Tuesday. Surrounded by bear gall bladders, bear-claw jewelry, skin parts, whole stuffed bears, skulls, dried abalone and the genitalia of seals and Asian tigers, regional game warden chief <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> said the investigation helped to `` wipe out the poaching of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s precious wildlife.'' An additional 23 people in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> are expected to be charged as a result of `` Operation Ursus,'' the code name given the 23-month probe by the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> and Game. Many of the animal parts were sold to Asians who regard them as aphrodisiacs and tonics, he said. At one point, an undercover warden taking part in an illegal `` safari'' in the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> was forced to kill a treed bear, <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> said as he described the complexity and danger of the probe. <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> said 74 misdemeanor complaints were filed against 52 defendants. The charges range from illegally killing bears to selling bear-claw jewelry at swap meets. So far, <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> said, agents have made 14 arrests and obtained three search warrants. Those convicted of poaching can draw stiff fines and prison sentences, according to <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>. The display in the council chamber at <LOCATION> Colma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>, just south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, represented $ 85,000 worth of exotic animals and organs seized in the sting, he said. The probe extended from the black bear range of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, with the arrests made over two months, said <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>. He singled out the Yau Hing Apothecary Ship in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, object of a search that yielded `` bear galls, mounted bears, seal and tiger penises, abalone, rhino horn and powder.'' The probe recovered parts of animals taken outside the country and illegally shipped here, he said. Russian bear gall bladders were sold in two cases, but one turned out to be from a cow, he said. The bear parts are purchased mainly by Asians who believe eating the organs will transfer the bear's strength, health and courage. `` Northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> arrests included a <LOCATION> Weaverville </LOCATION> man for felony sale of 25 wet bear galls and five skulls; a <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION> art dealer for felony sale of bear-claw rings and pendants; a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bruno </LOCATION> exotic meat dealer for sale of bear hams, galls, skin and other bear and tiger parts, and a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bruno </LOCATION> taxidermist for sale of a bear rug and skull,'' said <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>. In describing the illegal safari, <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> said the undercover warden was included in the party after passing himself off as a game hunter. `` He had been with them on several hunts,'' <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> said. `` When the bear was treed, the agent was with three outlaws, all of whom were armed. The time was 1 a.m. in a remote and steep forest. If he had refused to kill the bear, they surely would have suspected who he really was and his life would have been in danger.'' Prior approval had been given for the killing `` if it became necessary,'' said <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>. `` Although we regret the loss of the bear, we hope its sacrifice will prevent the loss of many other bears in the future,'' he said.

<HEAD>Misuse of Auto Seat Belts Said Cutting Their Effectiveness</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 While the increasingly widespread use of automobile lap-shoulder belts is saving hundreds of lives, the belts often are misused in ways that reduce their effectiveness, a federal study concluded Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said the most common abuse of the car safety belts is that they are worn too loosely or _ often in the case of children _ are tucked under the arm or back because of concern about the high angle of the harness. `` The lap-shoulder belts are very effective and achieve about all that can be expected of them if they are properly used,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>. `` But we have a lot of misuse and that problem has to be tackled.'' The safety board report is based on previous studies of seat belt use by other government agencies and the insurance industry as well as a detailed examination of 167 accidents in which at least one occupant wore a belt. <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, one of the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> staff investigators involved in the study, said the findings were not meant to be a random statistical sample, but that the data is `` consistent with the finding of widespread -LRB- belt -RRB- misuse.'' An examination of the accidents showed that 21 percent of the motorists were wearing belts too loosely, reducing their protection, the safety board said. It also cited an insurance industry study of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> motorists that put the estimate at about 25 percent. Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said belts should be worn with no more than the width of a person's fist separating the belt from the body. The safety board urged the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to require that safety belts meet standards as to the maximum amount of slack allowed or require that the belt systems be equipped with a `` pre-tension'' device that automatically pulls a belt tight a split second before a crash. In addition, the examination of accident cases by the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> showed that 7 percent of the belt users had the shoulder harness portion of their belt routed improperly under an arm or behind their backs. Misuse of the belts was most prevelent among children, where one-third had belts not properly used. In some cases, children had belts routed under an arm or behind the back, two children were wearing a single belt or children wore belts with the seat in a reclining position, the report said. `` Such misuse ... seriously degrades the protective capabilities of the lap-shoulder belt, reducing it to a lap-only belt with inferior crash protection,'' the safety board said. Ironically, a number of auto safety pamphlets, including two distributed by the <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> and one by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, have advised parents to place the shoulder belt behind a child if the harness crosses the neck or face. `` The safety board does not agree,'' the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> report said. `` ... There is little evidence that small children or short adults are likely to be harmed by the shoulder portion of a ... belt.'' It said that in the accidents investigated it found no evidence `` that the shoulder ... belt induced more serious injuries to children than it prevented.'' The board called for the highway safety agency to revise its brochures. `` We have not had a chance to read -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> report -RRB- and have no comment at this time,'' <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> said. Among the accidents, according to the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>, in which belt misuse had tragic results, were: _ A head-on crash in which a woman passenger, who had loosened her shoulder harness extensively, was killed Her husband, the driver, had worn his belt snugly and `` walked away from the crash with moderate injuries,'' said <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Stack </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> staff researcher. _ A crash in which a car struck a tree The driver, who had worn his belt properly, escaped with minor injuries while the passenger, whose shoulder belt was routed under her arm, was killed.

 A manners expert says a self-help video she plans to produce will be just the thing for young executives hoping to avoid `` power failures at power lunches.'' `` It's going to show young businessmen and women how to eat their way to the top with style and grace,'' <PERSON> Marjabelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said Tuesday. Mrs. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, who has written 15 books on etiquette, said there was a growing need for well-groomed manners in the business world. Instructions on how to hold silverware would be similar to a golf lesson, she said. `` I'll show them the proper grip and motion, everything,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said more and more executives were scrutinizing the manners of prospective employees, taking applicants to lunch to `` see how they get along with the other members of the club.'' The video, `` The Code of Etiquette,'' will retail for $ 89.98 and is due for release in the spring, Mrs. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. It also may be useful for busy parents and could replace traditional manners lessons dispensed daily around dinner tables, she said. `` Young working parents do n't have time anymore to serve big meals every night and teach their children manners,'' she said. `` Today, we're eating at the stove; eating out of the refrigerator; eating in front of the television.''

 `` Deaf President Now'' was the cry, made by voice or by fluttering fingers, as about 1,500 people rallied at <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday to urge selection of the first deaf president in the school's 124-year history. `` Today we are marching and speaking for our civil rights,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sussman </PERSON>, former dean of student affairs, said in sweeping sign language to the cheering crowd of students, alumni, faculty members and administrators. `` I think it's high time that we are in control of our own lives and our own institution,'' <PERSON> Sussman </PERSON>, who is a professor of counseling and psychology, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Communicating through an interpreter, <PERSON> Sussman </PERSON>, who is deaf, said, `` I think we can do it much better and with more sensitivity than people who are not deaf. <LOCATION> Gallaudet </LOCATION>, established by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1864, is the only liberal arts college for the deaf in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We need a deaf president now!'' student body president <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Hlibok </PERSON> signed enthusiastically, leading the crowd in a signed and shouted chant of `` Now!

 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s allies in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> should spend more money for defense, but congressional denunciations are n't the best way to get that done, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` I quite agree with the thesis that our allies need to do more,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. But he added that `` I do n't think it is very useful to simply berate the Europeans on this.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>'s comments came as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was heading for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to attend a two-day summit meeting of leaders of the 16-nation <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, D-Pa., the <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman, criticized <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations for what he said was `` unequal sharing. He told <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> `` our allies in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> are not doing, in my estimation, enough for their own defense.'' Criticism of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> has long been popular on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, where legislators have complained time and again that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> taxpayers are footing a disproportionate share of the alliance's defense bill. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is devoting about 6 percent of its gross national product to defense while no other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries spend a little more than 3 percent. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> agreed that `` we need to make every effort to get our allies to do more,'' but he said they now do more than is `` generally recognized.'' For example, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> supplies 90 percent of the ground troops which would be used to halt a Soviet attack. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s defense budget is 5.7 percent of the nation's GNP, not 6 percent, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. He also noted that American defense budgets have generally stayed even or declined in recent years. That was n't good enough for <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, who noted that the recent reductions came atop large increases in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first term. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> has long set a target for each member to increase spending by 3 percent a year after inflation, and most nations do n't meet that target, <PERSON> Carluicci </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has n't met the 3 percent target for at least four years, he added. Both <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, told the committee that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> needs to improve its conventional defenses in the wake of the treaty banning medium-range atomic missiles from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. That is similar to the message <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is carrying to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies and echoes a theme which the administration has been pushing since the treaty was signed Dec. 8 by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> detailed <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s shortcomings in non-nuclear weapons, but added, `` surely the prospect of having to fight 16 nations at once remains a sobering one for the Kremlin.'' `` But, put candidly, both the level of -LRB- nuclear -RRB- deterrence and the nuclear threshold remain too low,'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said. `` The chiefs have for a number of years consistently testified to that effect.'' `` It is essential for the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members to correct'' the problems in non-nuclear weapons, he said. At the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> historian <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies `` ought to bear a larger share of the defense burden'' now that they have been rebuilt with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> help after World War II. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, author of the best-selling `` The Rise and Fall of Great Nations,'' said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should spurn protectionism and increase spending for basic technologies and for commercial research and development. <PERSON> Jeane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, agreed with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies should bear more of the burden. But she criticized his view that there is a direct correlation between military spending and economic growth. Sen. <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the panel, noted that `` the help we gave and the protection we've given have helped <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> grow back into power Now, they are friendly competitors. But while they've taken us to the woodshed in international trade, we're the ones paying for the guards at the woodshed door.'' `` It seems to me we are draining our power trying to do too much,'' said <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>. `` Our adversaries are happy to see us try. Our allies have n't done as much as they can to help.''

 A 16-month-old girl pushed onto a fire ant mound by the family's dog has died of hundreds of insect bites, officials said Tuesday.

 Soldiers enforced calm in <LOCATION> Dakar </LOCATION> Tuesday following a day of rioting prompted by the announcement that the president was winning national elections. The president defended his decision to impose a state of emergency. Streets were littered with stones and children played with spent tear gas cannisters on Tuesday, a day after soldiers and riot police battled demonstrators. Crews removed the shells of burned-out cars from the roads. Riot police and soldiers were visible in much of the city, especially in the most densely populated neighborhoods. President <PERSON> Abdou </PERSON> <PERSON> Diouf </PERSON> met with members of his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday to assess the situation. Opponents had charged that the vote that gave <PERSON> Diouf </PERSON> his second 5-year term was rigged. The president, in a communique read over national radio, said the voting was fair. The communique said <PERSON> Diouf </PERSON> imposed a state of emergency to `` guarantee the legitimate aims of the people: peace, security, and economic and social progress.'' In an interview with French television, <PERSON> Diouf </PERSON> also defended the decision to arrest the leading opposition presidential candidate, <PERSON> Abdoulaye </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> of the Senegalese <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` I have the impression that our adversaries, as I had feared, are very bad losers and they had used many children in a maneuver to try to sow disorder and violence,'' <PERSON> Diouf </PERSON> said. He said his actions were necessary to `` protect democracy.'' The preliminary tally showed <PERSON> Diouf </PERSON> with 688,476 votes to <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>'s 299,998 Two other candidates got less than 10,000 votes. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in this West African nation will announce the official results Friday. Radio broadcasts announcing that <PERSON> Diouf </PERSON> was receiving about 77 percent of the vote sparked widespread demonstrations Monday in the capital. The headquarters of <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>'s party, which was scene of considerable violence on Monday, was quiet. The government said <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> and other opposition leaders were being questioned about the riots. More than 260 people were believed to have been arrested during the violence Monday. <LOCATION> Dakar </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Cheikh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> also remained closed and riot police stood guard at several of the entrances. A week before the election, <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> had said his party would become a liberation movement if the voting was rigged. On election day Sunday and again on Monday, <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> and other opposition leaders accused <PERSON> Diouf </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of providing its supporters with cards to allow them to vote several times. <PERSON> Diouf </PERSON> was widely expected to win re-election. Opposition supporters view his government as a continuation of the leadership in <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> since it achieved independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1960. <PERSON> Diouf </PERSON> succeeded President <PERSON> Leopold </PERSON> <PERSON> Senghor </PERSON> when <PERSON> Senghor </PERSON> retired in January 1981. In another development, Director of Communications <PERSON> Tidiane </PERSON> <PERSON> Ndiongue </PERSON> apologized to a photographer who works for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and was arrested for seven hours during Monday's riots. The photographer, <PERSON> Axel </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulz-Ebbers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, said he was picked up outside opposition party headquarters and beaten. <PERSON> Ndiongue </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> had informed police that accredited journalists were allowed to report on the disturbances. <PERSON> Diouf </PERSON>'s government has been praised by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other Western nations for maintaining a multiparty system, a rarity in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Diouf </PERSON> also has been pro-Western in international forums.

<TEXT>
 A record-low number of rare right whales was spotted during an annual survey off the coasts of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquarium </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. An aquarium team that spent February surveying the right whale population in their popular wintering grounds detected only one mother-calf pair and five whales traveling separately. The total was three below the previous low of 10 in 1984, said aquarium researcher <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Kraus </PERSON>. The highest number spotted during the five years the survey has been conducted off the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> coasts was 26 in 1986, <PERSON> Kraus </PERSON> said. He said it was premature to speculate on reasons for the apparent decline in the right whale population in the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> waters, which are considered popular calving grounds. `` We do n't know whether the numbers are low because of a local problem that kept the whales away from that area,'' said <PERSON> Kraus </PERSON>. `` Or they may be somewhere down there and we are missing them.'' <PERSON> Kraus </PERSON> said there were reports the water temperature had been abnormally high this winter. But he said it was not clear if that caused the whales to winter elsewhere. The aquarium will match the winter survey numbers with those recorded next spring when the whales return to waters from <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION>. That should help determine whether the right whale population has declined or if the whales chose a new location to spend the winter, <PERSON> Kraus </PERSON> said. The surveys have been conducted in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> waters for nine years and this was the fifth year of the survey off <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. The four prior surveys there have found right whales prefer to winter in waters five to 20 miles off the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> coast and within two miles of the beaches of <LOCATION> northeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Right whales are considered the rarest of the large whale species. The worldwide right whale population is estimated at 2,500. It it is believed that 240 to 350 live in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. There are three types of right whales, which are known for their unusually large heads. The type found in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> are Black Right Whales, which have black bodies and sometimes with white areas on the belly. Black Right Whales grow up to 60 feet long.

<TEXT>
 Morning rush-hour was quiet Tuesday as a massive rebuilding job began on one of the nation's busiest freeways, a project that had state highway officials ready for the worst. The $ 210 million overhaul will widen the <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Expressway </PERSON> from eight to 10 lanes, and while work is under way _ for six-month periods both this year and next year _ traffic will be squeezed into half the normal number of lanes. On Tuesday several lanes were closed on each side of the freeway for building crossovers and making surface repairs. Commuters and traffic experts have feared that the project could create massive traffic jams because the highway is one of the nation's busiest, carrying 225,000 cars daily, but things went smoothly early Monday. `` The congestion was apparently zilch,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Nash </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> was clear the whole morning and there was no buildup of traffic.'' The state had conducted a months-long publicity campaign, urging commuters to use alternate routes, car pool or take public transportation. The Chicago Area Transportation Study distributed 37,000 ride-sharing applications and doubled its list of car-pool applicants to 6,000. State officials say the overhaul of the three-mile stretch will greatly improve the commute on the 11-mile freeway. The work will cost more than the $ 179.7 million it took to build road 25 years ago.

 A defense attorney attacked the credibility of a pilot testifying Tuesday in the smuggling trial of <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON>, winning an admission that the man continued trafficking drugs while cooperating with the government. <PERSON> Leverett </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>, 66, testified Monday that he made six cocaine flights in 1979. Those flights, made with admitted smuggler <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, are those listed in the indictment of <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, 38, and co-defendant <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, reputed to be one of the leaders of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s violent <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> cocaine </ORGANIZATION> smugglers, is on trial on charges that he and others conspired to smuggle 3.3 tons of cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> via <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> from 1978 to 1980. Under cross-examination Tuesday by defense attorney <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> admitted he conducted other smuggling activity while we was cooperating with the government and testifying before a grand jury in 1980. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> is testifying under immunity from prosecution. He said he made flights to <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> for other people in 1980, bringing in either hashish or marijuana. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pilot, bristled when <PERSON> Quinon </PERSON> used the word ` lie' when discussing inconsistent statements in his testimony and his grand jury appearances eight years ago. `` I do n't like the word, ` lie.' I looked it up in the dictionary last night and I suggest you do the same,'' he told <PERSON> Quinon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quinon </PERSON> laboriously questioned <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> about his grand jury testimony in 1980 and many times Tuesday <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> said he could n't remember what he said in 1980 `` I'm sure the grand jury testimony as a whole is correct,'' <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> is charged with conspiracy, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and operating a continuing criminal enterprise. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, is charged only with being a part of the smuggling conspiracy. Defense attorneys and prosecutors got into several exchanges Tuesday out of the jury's presence. After one of a number of bench conferences with the judge, defense attorney <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> accused <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> of saying to him: `` You're going to sleaze yourself right into a hole, mister.'' <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> called <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>'s remarks `` patently offensive.'' <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>, however, argued that he made the comment to Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> and said: `` They're -LRB- defense attorneys -RRB- going to sleaze themselves into a hole.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> said he did n't plan to take any action and told the attorneys to present the exchange to a grievance committee if they desired to do so.

 A middle-aged gunman riding on a motorbike fatally wounded the chief executive officer of a Greek chemical company as he was driving to work Tuesday. A left-wing group claimed responsibility. A police spokesman said <PERSON> Alexandros </PERSON> <PERSON> Athanassiadis </PERSON>, 59, was hit four times in the chest and stomach as he reached for a pistol that he kept in his car. The shooting took place at 8:15 a.m. in rush-hour traffic on <LOCATION> Kifissias </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, a main highway leading north from the city center, according to the spokesman, who was not identified in line with police regulations. He said the attack was `` a carbon copy'' of the 1983 killing of Capt. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsantes </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officer attached to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> who was shot by two men on a motorbike at the same Kifissias Avenue intersection. And the same terrorist group, the November 17 organization, asserted responsibility for both slayings. The spokesman gave this account of Tuesday's attack. `` Athanassiadis had the passenger window down and was chatting to someone in another car at a red light when two men on a motorbike came up on his right-hand side. `` A white-haired man in his 50s'' riding behind the younger, dark-haired driver fired at least six bullets at <LOCATION> Athanassiadis </LOCATION> from a 45-caliber pistol. The two men turned down down a side road into the <LOCATION> Psychico </LOCATION> suburb where the motorbike was found abandoned. <PERSON> Athanassiadis </PERSON> died at the <LOCATION> Hygeia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> during emergency surgery, Dr. <PERSON> Vassilis </PERSON> <PERSON> Georgoulis </PERSON> said. A typewritten note found in the street near the intersection and signed `` November 17'' said <PERSON> Athanassiadis </PERSON> was `` a classic capitalist ... indifferent to the health of the workers and the environment.'' <PERSON> Athanassiadis </PERSON> was chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Hellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> and Fertilizers and also was a director of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s largest holding group, the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Bodossakis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> He had headed <LOCATION> Pyrkal </LOCATION>, an ammunition and explosives manufacturing firm, until it was taken over by Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s socialist government in 1982 The note claimed that a <ORGANIZATION> Hellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> plant in western <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Athanassiadis </PERSON> planned to expand `` holds one of the largest responsibilities'' for air pollution in the capital. November 17 terrorists have asserted responsibility for 10 other killings since 1975. None of the slayings has been solved. It also boasted of carrying out the remote-control bombings of two buses carrying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel in April and August 1987 that wounded 26 Americans and three Greeks. Other business executives said <PERSON> Athanassiadis </PERSON> maintained a low profile, refused to hire bodyguards and always drove his own car. `` He kept a pistol beside him in the car ever since learning that he was probably on the November 17 hit list,'' said one businessmen, who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisal. It was the first fatal attack by November 17 terrorists since February 1986 when steel magnate <PERSON> Dimitris </PERSON> <PERSON> Angelopoulos </PERSON> was shot while walking to work in central <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. November 17 is named for the day in 1973 that troops crushed a student rebellion against the military dictatorship that ruled <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> from 1967-74. In its previous declarations the group demanded the closure of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and said the government had failed to reform Greek society. Government spokesman <PERSON> Sotiris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostopoulos </PERSON> issued a statement expressing `` very deep sorrow'' at <PERSON> Athanassiades </PERSON>' killing and saying `` the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> people as a whole condemn such terrorist actions.''

 The cars of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Yukon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> will roll along the gold rush Trail of'98 this spring for the first time in more than five years, officials said Tuesday. The railroad plans to reopen May 12 as a seasonal tourist line out of <LOCATION> Skagway </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, vice president and chief executive officer for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Yukon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> `` Everything is a go,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said in a conference call from <LOCATION> Skagway </LOCATION> `` We anticipate 50,000 passengers this first year.'' For a $ 65 ticket, tourists will get a 3 -LCB- - hour, 40.8-mile round trip to the peak of the White Pass Most of the route shadows the <LOCATION> Deadhorse </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Trail </LOCATION>, which miners followed into the Klondike gold fields in 1898. The railroad took the place of the trail in 1900 and ran until October 1982, carrying passengers and freight the 110 miles between <LOCATION> Skagway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Whitehorse </LOCATION>, capital of the Yukon Territory. The line closed after losing its freight business during a worldwide mining slump. The 800 people of <LOCATION> Skagway </LOCATION> lost 150 railroad jobs; <LOCATION> Whitehorse </LOCATION> lost 50. White Pass is trying to sell its freight equipment, and <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said unless there's an unforeseen development boom in <LOCATION> Whitehorse </LOCATION>, it's unlikely the full line will reopen. But tourism may prompt further expansion in 1989 and after, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. The line will stop short of the Canadian border this year because the railroad did not have time to negotiate the crossing. The reopening was assured when the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> unions agreed Monday to contract concessions, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. The primary concession allows the train to run with three-person crews instead of the traditional five-person crew used on freight lines, he said. The May-through-September business will employ more than 20 people during the season and four to six people year-around, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. It will cost about $ 1 million to get the line running by May 12, he said. The line itself is in fairly good condition, but the passenger cars need substantial renovation, he said. The railroad plans to run up to four round trips a day, carrying an average of 250 passengers each.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, urging Western solidarity in arms talks with the Soviets, arrived Tuesday for the first <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit in six years after pledging that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops will remain in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> `` so long as Europeans want them to stay.''

The two-day meeting at <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, beginning Wednesday, brings together the heads of state or government of the 16-member <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The conference sets the stage for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s expected summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in late May or early June. With the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters site under unusually tight security, Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> was the first to arrive. The representatives of 14 other countries were scheduled to arrive Wednesday. In his departure statement, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> hailed the newly signed treaty to abolish <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles -LRB- INF -RRB-, but said, `` the purpose of this summit is not self-congratulations.'' `` Our first priority is to maintain a strong and healthy partnership between <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, for this is the foundation on which the cause of freedom so crucially depends,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will continue to press for a 50 percent reduction in strategic nuclear weapons and a global ban on chemical weapons. Beyond that, he said the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders will try `` to give negotiations on conventional forces a new start, as well.'' `` If our common approach to the East over the years has given coherence to our message of peace and world freedom, it has been our unwavering commitment to defend ourselves that has given it credibility,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` Arms reduction can only succeed if it is backed up by a strong defense,'' he added. `` My <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> colleagues and I will rededicate ourselves to maintaining the deterrent that has protected our freedom and prosperity for almost 40 years.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> session opens Wednesday with remarks by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> secretary general, followed by two restricted working sessions, a luncheon and dinner. Another restricted working session is planned Thursday, followed by closing remarks by <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and a news conference by <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who broke off his shuttle diplomacy in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> to join the president in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. Besides the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the members of the alliance are <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keel </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, said on the eve of the summit that he thought the leaders would likely declare that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> places a high priority on negotiating conventional arms stability in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Alliance sources, declining to be identified publicly, have said that such a declaration may be in addition to an overall statement which will boil down to a renewed pledge of confidence in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> policies and goals. It is hoped the new conventional talks can begin in earnest in the fall in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. `` There's a general consensus now'' on key elements of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s negotiating position, namely, that cuts should be `` assymetric'' in view of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact's large numerical advantage in conventional firepower, according to Keel The summit is designed to be a public display of alliance solidarity despite peace and disarmament gestures from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. It also is intended to reassure Europeans that the INF agreement will not leave them vulnerable to superior numbers of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact tanks and artillery. The budget crunch in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has triggered some fears in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> about a possible reduction in the 326,000 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops stationed in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Planners on both sides of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> said the leaders planned to play down disagreements, such as the updating of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s short-range nuclear arms, most of which are deployed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and disputes over basing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> Despite the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> role as the leader and paymaster of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will play a low-key role in public at the two-day meeting, delivering only a brief summary statement at the close on Thursday. In all, the schedule called for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to be away from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> only 57 and one-half hours, including 15 hours and 15 minutes on Air Force One flying to and from <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. He will return Thursday evening, in plenty of time to celebrate his 36th wedding annivesary Friday with his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s themes for the meeting were carefully sketched out in advance in a series of public remarks, including an address broadcast to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> last week and a speech on Monday to an American Legion convention. He warned that the West must remain vigilant about the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and be skeptical about its intentions. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> must keep nuclear forces in place and up to date. The president said the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>'s numerical superiority in non-nuclear forces _ the so-called conventional forces _ must be addressed with the same urgency as the problem of strategic nuclear weapons. And he suggested that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members should pay a greater share of the alliance's defense burden. Testifying to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies should spend more money for defense. But he also said that congressional denunciation of alliance partners is not the best way to get that done. `` I quite agree with the thesis that our allies need to do more,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. But he added that `` I do n't think it is very useful to simply berate the Europeans on this.''

<HEAD>Plan to Spend $6 Million on Pilots' Leather Jackets Draws Fire</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> plan to spend $ 6.1 million on World War II-style leather jackets to boost flight crews' esprit de corps is drawing flak from civilians and retirees affected by budget cuts. `` I'm upset with this leather-jacket bit,'' <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Enyart </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> major who now lives in nearby <LOCATION> Fairview </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, said Tuesday. `` If we have to measure our patriotism by whether or not we have leather jackets, <PERSON> God </PERSON> help us, we're in trouble.'' About 280 of the 53,000 `` bomber'' jackets will go to flight crews with the <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. `` To me it does n't reflect the professionalism of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Enyart </PERSON>, a former official of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a national organization that works to promote a strong national defense. `` It reflects a bunch of people wanting leather jackets,'' he said. The nation's armed services were ordered in November to slash 10 percent from their budgets for fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> share of the reductions for the year amount to about $ 10.5 billion. Smaller custs were ordered for the current fiscal year. Critics say the jackets, which cost $ 115 each, are a prime example of waste. <PERSON> Enyart </PERSON> said he had received calls from about 20 people _ civilians as well as active and retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> personnel _ supporting his stance after local reports about his criticism of the jacket purchases during a time of budget austerity. Wide-ranging spending reductions throughout the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> include curtailment of equipment purchases and personnel cuts. Even retirees' medical benefits have been reduced, <PERSON> Enyart </PERSON> said. A hiring freeze has been in effect at <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> since Dec. 8, and last month, an undetermined number of temporary part-time civilian jobs were eliminated at <LOCATION> Scott </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, the base's command began offering voluntary early retirement to eligible civilian workers. The jacket purchases should be cut before jobs, said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Denton </PERSON>, an official of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>' Local R7-23, which represents about 3,000 civilian workers at <LOCATION> Scott </LOCATION>. `` It would seem to me that people putting hamburger on their table should come before they -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials -RRB- put a new jacket on a pilot's back,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> sees it differently. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> plans to issue these flying jackets to primary crew members in order to enhance esprit de corps and to recognize the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s front-line pilots, navigators, weapons officers and enlisted crew members for their important contributions to the nation's defense,'' said a statement Tuesday from <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> officials at <LOCATION> Scott </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> plans to distribute the jackets to active and reserve forces. The jackets are to be purchased during the 1988 and 1989 fiscal years, officials say. Delivering them to flight crews is expected to take about a year, beginning in June.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Walden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pond </LOCATION>, the retreat idealized by <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Thoreau </PERSON> in 1845, is at the center of a debate over whether it should be preserved or whether it should, as <PERSON> Thoreau </PERSON> wrote, `` belong to the public.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> declined Tuesday to adopt a bill that would ban swimming at <LOCATION> Walden </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, 15 miles west of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The bill would eliminate a manmade sand beach, restrict fishing and boating and require construction of sound barriers beside nearby roadways. Instead, committee members said they would consider expanding membership on the pond's citizen advisory panel. `` Fencing off <LOCATION> Walden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pond </LOCATION> and banning swimming would be contrary to both the philosophy of <PERSON> Thoreau </PERSON> and the wishes of the owners who gave the property to the state,'' <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutensohn </PERSON> told the committee. `` I'm sure the Indians swam at <LOCATION> Walden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pond </LOCATION>, I'm sure <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Thoreau </PERSON> swam at <LOCATION> Walden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pond </LOCATION> and I'm sure the people of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> should,'' <PERSON> Gutensohn </PERSON> said. The chief opponent of continued recreation at <LOCATION> Walden </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, did not attend the hearing though the legislation was sponsored by her group, <ORGANIZATION> Walden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forever </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION> resident, said in a telephone interview that 50 years of public recreation at the pond have endangered its fragile banks and spoiled a pristine site `` They've turned it into another <LOCATION> Coney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> said. She charged DEM officials with spending their spare time scouring <PERSON> Thoreau </PERSON>'s writings looking for a quotation that would support public recreation at the pond. <PERSON> Gutensohn </PERSON> did slip a <PERSON> Thoreau </PERSON> quotation into his remarks. The 19th-century naturalist philosopher said, `` As in many countries precious metals belong to the crown, so here more precious natural objects of rare beauty should belong to the public.'' A state pamphlet on the pond quotes <PERSON> Thoreau </PERSON> as writing in his `` Journal'' in 1850, `` When the frogs dream and the grass waves, and the buttercups toss their heads, and the heat disposes to bathe in the ponds and streams, then is summer begun.'' <PERSON> Gutensohn </PERSON> said that the deed from the <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Heywood </PERSON> and <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> families bequeathing <PERSON> Walden </PERSON> to the state in 1922 specified that it be preserved `` for the public who wish to enjoy the pond, the woods and nature, including bathing, boating, fishing and picnicking.'' Today the 62-acre pond in a 333-acre reservation receives 350,000 visitors a year. On summer weekends crowds frequently exceed its rated capacity of 1,000 visitors, according to <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Faron </PERSON>, supervisor of the reservation. State officials acknowledge that <PERSON> Walden </PERSON> took a beating when little was done to prevent visitors from causing erosion and much done to render the pond unrecognizable to its 19th-century admirers. `` Anytime you have a first-class resource you have a threat of overuse,'' said <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinreb </PERSON>, the state's project manager for the pond. In the 13 years that the DEM has controlled <LOCATION> Walden </LOCATION>, the state has spent $ 2 million on projects to upgrade and preserve the site. Another $ 500,000 has been set aside for restoring the banks of the pond. <PERSON> Gutensohn </PERSON> said the money will cover about half of the restoration job. In addition, the state plans to limit parking around the pond to keep down summertime attendance.

<HEAD>Cuba Has Battlefield Missiles, But They Aren't Nukes, Officials
Say</HEAD>

 The <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> military has some surface-to-surface missiles in its inventory, but none has a nuclear warhead and none could reach the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> even if they did, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Tuesday. The defense and administration officials commented under questioning prompted by Republican presidential candidate <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s continued insistence, in the face of denials, that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> may have Soviet-made nuclear missiles aimed at the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The officials said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has about five dozen Frog-4 and Frog-7 battlefield missiles, date to the 1960s. The Frog-7, when originally introduced by the Soviets, could carry either a conventional or nuclear warhead, `` but we're confident no nuclear warheads ever went to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> for that missile and it does n't have any range anyway,'' said one source who requested anonymity According to the reference book `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s Weapon Systems,'' the Frog-7 has a range of only about 43 miles _ or half the distance between <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Moreover, the rocket has no guidance system to direct it to a specific target. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> dismissed <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s missile claim when the candidate first advanced it last month He said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> had been under extensive surveillance since the 1962 missile crisis and there was `` no evidence'' any other nuclear weaponry had ever been deployed there by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The officials contacted Tuesday endorsed that assessment, but most insisted they not be identified on grounds they wished to avoid entanglement in the presidential race. The sources said <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> long ago assembled the strongest military in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, but they said his forces posed little offensive threat to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. On the other hand, they said, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> does serve as a major outpost for Soviet forces, particularly surveillance units, and it supports communist movements around the world from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> is a horrible force for instability, but it is not a military threat to us directly,'' said one Pentagon official. `` And it is certainly not a nuclear threat. They do not have any missiles that could reach the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ nuclear or conventional _ and they do not have any nuclear bombs to hang on the jets that could reach us.'' `` <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s military power has not appreciably increased in recent years,'' said one administration official. `` Rather, their forces have been modernized to keep pace.'' `` In overall terms, they really are not any more of a direct military threat to us than they were 10 years ago,'' said another source. `` It's serving as the host to the Russians that bothers us.'' <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Prucha </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> endorsed the most recent assessment of <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> military power published by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. According to that assessment, the <LOCATION> Cubans </LOCATION> have an active-duty military force of approximately 175,000, of which 145,000 are in the army, 12,000 in the navy and 18,500 in the air force. Within the army, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> believes the Cubans have about 65 of the Frog missiles, <PERSON> Prucha </PERSON> said. Also in the Cuban inventory:

 _ A wide variety of Soviet-made surface-to-air missiles that could be used against attacking aircraft, as well as short-range artillery rockets like the BM-21 and BM-24 _ About 950 tanks, including 300 of the more capable T-62 tanks, and at least 50 BMP infantry combat vehicles _ Two Koni-class navy frigates made by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, along with three diesel submarines, 77 fast-attack patrol boats and 15 mine sweepers _ More than 250 Soviet-supplied combat aircraft, including at least 50 modern MiG-23 Flogger ground-attack jets and more than 100 MiG-21 jet interceptors Three years ago, Adm. <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, then the head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, described <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s forces as well equipped `` to defend <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> against anything short of a massive invasion.'' He said the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> air force _ with aircraft like the MiG-25s _ had `` the range to reach portions of the southeastern <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> and most of the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> area.'' `` But that does n't mean they have anything nuclear to hang on those planes,'' said one <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> source. `` We maintain constant surveillance on <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, including SR-71 -LRB- spy plane -RRB- reconnaissance. `` Everything that goes in to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> is monitored, and nuclear weapons have n't gone in.''

 <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> spoke out Tuesday against efforts to place an independent watchdog at his agency like those already in place at 19 other federal departments. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said a proposal by Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., to place an independent inspector general at the spy agency `` will actually prove to be counterproductive to an effective inspection and investigation process. He told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that the presence of an investigator with access to personnel and secret records could deter foreign intelligence services and other sensitive sources from sharing information with <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, fearing its possible disclosure. The proposal for an independent inspector general at the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> grew out of last summer's Iran-Contra investigation, which found the agency's current inspector general `` lacked the manpower, resources and tenacity'' to uncover many of the abuses turned up during that probe. The current inspector general is chosen by the agency's director and lacks the institutional independence of the IG post at most other federal departments. The post is now held by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON>, a 33-year <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> veteran appointed by <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>. <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the panel is unable to oversee the agency as thoroughly as an in-house watchdog would be able to do. He noted that other departments with sensitive intelligence operations, like the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, have independent investigators inside their bureaucracies. <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>'s bill would permit the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director to deny investigators access to documents or personnel if needed to protect sensitive secrets or an active covert operation. But the director would have to defend such an action to the congressional intelligence committees. Both <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general, and <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Funk </PERSON>, inspector general at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, testified they have had no problems with disclosure of classified information. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' investigative arm, said a review of inspector general operations government-wide had found they substantially strengthen accountability and improve operations. `` We believe that a statutory IG would be as appropriate and effective for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> as it has been for the other agencies,'' <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON> said. And he said he was concerned that making a tour of duty in the inspector general's office a part of routine career development for <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> employees, as <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> proposed, would further rob the office of independence. <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> said that while he did not doubt <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>'s good intentions, `` the problem is that you're not going to always be director of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. Our memories are fresh about a director of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> who did not always forward information to this committee'' _ an apparent reference to <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>'s predecessor.

 Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, described as `` middle <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> at its very best,'' received the endorsement Tuesday of two former governors of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. Standing in the sun-bathed steps of the state Capitol, the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman told supporters the nation's future depended on `` our ability to gain control of our economic destiny.'' Former governors <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McNair </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> defended the candidate against charges that his trade program was protectionist. <PERSON> McNair </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> `` has faced up to putting <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> first with a fair, sound and sensible trade bill. One who believes if we're going to open our markets up, you open your markets up.'' <PERSON> McNair </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> bill was `` not a protectionist piece of legislation, as some have tried to portray it, but it is what's best for this country. `` He's not a protectionist at all,'' said <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>. `` He's a pragmatist.'' <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>, who served as governor from 1977 to 1985, said of <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, `` He's middle <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> at its very best.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said he supported legislation that would limit the growth of textile imports to 1 percent a year. An estimated 45 percent of the jobs in South carolina are in the textile industry. The import restriction legislation is an issue in the Republican as well as Democratic race. Republicans <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, campaigning for support in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> GOP primary this Saturday support the bill. <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> rivals <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> oppose it. `` For people here to have the kind of opportunity we all want, we have to have a new trade policy,'' said <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. `` This is a state that had a great textile industry, a great fabric industry,'' he went on. `` That industry is in trouble, has been in trouble in part because we have not had leadership and policies at the federal level that will guarantee fair treatment for the textile workers and the textile companies here in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>.'' The <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman said that as president he would press for policies that `` will give the textile workers of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> an equal right to sell their products in markets all over the country and give them the right to not be impacted by unfair trade practices by countries all over the world.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s campaign manager <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrick </PERSON> described <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>, who was governor of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> from 1977 to 1985, as a leader of the progressive wing of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the state. He said <PERSON> McNair </PERSON>, who was governor from 1965 to 1971, was a leader of the ore conservative wing of the party. He said their dual backing was `` a nice little bookend endorsement.'' Earlier Tuesday, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> visited former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> made it clear that with fellow Georgian <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> not in the race he had no plans to endorse any of the Democratic presidential candidates before the nominating convention next July

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration on Tuesday called attacks on Iranian and <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> cities a dangerous development in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war and adds `` a new urgency'' to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> work on an arms embargo designed to force a truce. <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, condemned the missile raids and said they represent `` a serious escalation of the Iran-Iraq war.'' `` Attacks on civilians achieve no military end,'' she said. `` They fuel the psychology of hatred which is responsible for continuing this destructive conflict.'' <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said Tuesday it fired 16 missiles into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. It was the first long-range rocket attack on the Iranian capital since the war began in September 1980. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said 27 civilians were killed. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> hit <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> with two missiles late Tuesday night, killing or wounding an unspecified number of civilians. Last July, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> adopted resolution 598 calling for a truce in the war and pledging to impose an arms embargo against either party that refused to heed the call. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has said it would accept a cease-fire but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has declined to go along and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been pressing the world body to impose the weapons ban on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` We believe adoption of an arms embargo resolution to enforce 598 has taken a new urgency with the renewal of the war of the cities,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. `` We urge all members of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to act on this now, without further delay, particularly permament members who have special responsibilities to provide leadership,'' she said. She was referring to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, said another <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> offered a compromise last week in an effort to satisfy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands for quick passage of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and meet a Soviet desire for more diplomacy by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, the official said. It would permit immediate passage of an embargo followed by a 30-day delay in implementation and another peace effort by <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. The official said that in response to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure to accept the compromise, the Soviet envoy to the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Belonogov </PERSON> has said he is awaiting a decision from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. On March 1, the rotating chairmanship of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> will pass from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said an arms embargo `` will make it more difficult for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to pursue the war,'' but will not mean an end to the conflict if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> desires to continue the fight. Negotiations between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> will also be necessary, she said.

 The family of a comatose man who was used as a human guinea pig filed suit Tuesday against the doctor who carried out the experiment. <PERSON> Pascal </PERSON> <PERSON> Louette </PERSON>, 24, who went into a deep coma following an auto accident, died Sunday after Dr. <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Milhaud </PERSON> placed him on a sabotaged medical device to see if the effects matched those of a similar case, currently the subject of a trial in <LOCATION> Poitiers </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Louette </PERSON> was considered clinically dead at the time of the experiment, which was performed at the <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Amiens </LOCATION>. News of the experiment was made public a week ago and touched off a furor in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Health Minister <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Barzach </PERSON> suspended <PERSON> Milhaud </PERSON> on Feb. 24 from his duties as chief anesthesiologist at the hospital center. The <PERSON> Louette </PERSON> family's lawyer, <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Lhote </PERSON>, said his clients filed suit against <PERSON> Milhaud </PERSON> for `` willful injury of a person unable to defend himself because of his mental or physical state.'' `` One ca n't treat a human being in the way <PERSON> Pascal </PERSON> was treated,'' said <PERSON> Lhote </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Louette </PERSON>'s parents were not properly informed about the medical care their son was receiving and suffered `` a double traumatism: the loss of a loved one and also the theft of a soul which was stolen from them.'' The exact date of the experiment has n't been made public. It was announced Feb. 23 in court testimony at the <LOCATION> Poitiers </LOCATION> trial. <PERSON> Louette </PERSON> was injured late last year and transferred to the <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Jan. 19. He fell into a deep coma shortly thereafter and was kept alive on a respirator. <PERSON> Milhaud </PERSON>'s experiment was prompted by a trial of three physicians in <LOCATION> Poitiers </LOCATION>, accused in connection with the 1984 death of a woman following an operation to remove a tumor. The woman, <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> <PERSON> Berneron </PERSON>, received nitrogen oxide instead of oxygen during resuscitation after the operation. A report later showed the tubes supplying the two gases had been switched. The state prosecutor on Tuesday asked for 15-year prison terms each for Drs. <PERSON> Bakari </PERSON> <PERSON> Diallo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Archambeau </PERSON>, both anesthesiologists. He did not ask for a specific sentence for Dr. <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Desforges-Meriel </PERSON>, charged with involuntary homicide.

<TEXT>
 Pornographic film star <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> was questioned again by police in the unsolved 1981 bludgeoning murders of four people as he lay gravely ill in a hospital bed, officials said Wednesday. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, who starred as <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wadd </PERSON> in a series of sex films in the 1970s and early 1980s, is suffering from AIDS, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday, quoting anonymous sources. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Egers </PERSON>, said Wednesday that his client did not answer the questions. <PERSON> Egers </PERSON> confirmed that <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> was hospitalized with a serious illness but refused to say if he suffered from AIDS. Rumors that <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> was suffering from AIDS have been circulating in the pornographic film industry for about a year. The incurable ailment usually is transmitted through sex, shared hypodermic needles, tainted blood products and from pregnant women to their babies. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> was acquitted in 1982 of the 1981 bludgeon murders of four people in the exclusive hillside community of Laurel Canyon. The crime remains unsolved. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said a new witness had surfaced and was in custody out of state. That, combined with <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>' illness, prompted police to re-question him in his hospital bed, the newspaper said. Detective <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>, supervisor of the murder investigation, would say only that the case remained active. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, 43, the premier male sex film star of the 1970s and early 1980s, made hundreds of sexually explicit films and thousands of peep shows. He was featured as the detective <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wadd </PERSON> in films such as `` Tell Them <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wadd </PERSON> Is Here,'' `` Liquid Lips'' and `` Blonde Fire.'' <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> was cleared in 1982 of killing <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Launius </PERSON>, 37; <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVerell </PERSON>, 44; <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, 22; and <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, 46, all of whom were beaten to death. Prosecutors said the four were part of a theft ring for which <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> acted as a middleman to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> nightclub owner <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON>, also known as <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nash </PERSON>. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> allegedly fenced stolen property for the group to <PERSON> Nash </PERSON>, who allegedly paid for the loot with drugs. <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> was sentenced later to eight years in prison for possession of two pounds of cocaine worth an estimated $ 1 million. He was released after serving less than two years.

Closure</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Major American Jewish groups said Tuesday they have distanced themselves from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's hotly contested move to close the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> observer mission to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. `` They -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials -RRB- are not doing this at the request of the American Jewish community,'' said <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>, associate executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Anti-terrorism legislation ordering the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s mission closed by March 21 has put the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in an isolated position at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. An emergency <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> session is under way on the mission's future. Scores of speakers, including close <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies, called the move a threat to the independence of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and asked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to submit the dispute to binding arbitration. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> both say closing the mission would violate the 1947 treaty under which the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters is based in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> reportedly is going to enforce the legislation. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> tried to head off the legislation, but major Jewish groups supported it. They saw it as a way to get at their main target, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office, according to <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>, <PERSON> Elan </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and others. `` Our hope was to induce the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to use the powers it had to close the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office,'' <PERSON> Baum </PERSON> said. `` We wanted it to send a symbolic message that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is a terrorist organization and it was not welcome in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' In a meeting last year with Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, the groups offered not to press for closure of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mission if the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office was shuttered, the Jewish leaders said. In September, the department ordered the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> office in the capital closed. <PERSON> Baum </PERSON> said his group told <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> in a Feb. 12 letter it would not press for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mission's closure. He said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has not replied. <PERSON> Baum </PERSON> said major Jewish groups sent a similar letter to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Dec. 3. `` We recognized that the headquarters agreement was a complicating factor,'' he said. But by then the legislation had won the support of such presidential aspirants as Sens. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> -LRB- R-Kan. -RRB-, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> -LRB- R-N.Y. -RRB- and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> -LRB- D-Ill. -RRB- `` It took on the life of its own,'' <PERSON> Baum </PERSON> Several speakers in the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of sacrificing international commitments to the pressure of domestic politics. They said closing the mission will further damage <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prestige at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and cripple the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace initiative. <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Clovis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON> on Tuesday laid much of the blame for what he called a `` corrosive legislative tantrum'' on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a powerful lobby. He said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration `` fell into the trap. It underestimated the hold of <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> on a majority of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' The Committee and the <ORGANIZATION> Zionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> were the only Jewish groups who kept lobbying against the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mission once the government closed the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office, <PERSON> Baum </PERSON> and others said in interviews. The 159-nation <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> is expected to approve a resolution Wednesday calling for arbitration and saying closure of the mission would violate the treaty. Another resolution asks the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to rule on whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must submit to arbitration. The resolutions are sponsored by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, several <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> allies and by members of the movement of nations professing non-alliance with either superpower. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was initially scheduled to address the General Assembly Tuesday, but the address was later moved to Wednesday because of the length of other speeches.

<TEXT>
 Here is the text of a statement released Tuesday, purporting to be from the kidnappers of kidnapped Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, as translated from the Arabic by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>: In the name of God, supporter of the oppressed, to the sons of our struggling people in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>, to the free men of the oppressed world. In addition to our previous statements on the detention of American <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent Col. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, we are keen to explain the following: 1. The propaganda that is being waged nowadays is aimed at minimizing the espionage role of Col. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> and diverting the issue of his detention into other incorrect objectives. It is also aimed at circumventing his political activity with certain suspicious currents and elements in the south. 2. The attempts undertaken by the American administration and the criminal <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -LRB- who -RRB- is moving inside and outside <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to ensure a quick release of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> so that he will not reveal secrets and make confessions are aimed at stopping the investigation of this criminal at a stage that will not allow us to find out all about the <LOCATION> American-Israeli </LOCATION> conspiracies against our people and nation. This is a failed attempt to wriggle out of the impasse the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is currently trapped in. 3. But we declare today that we have uncovered solid facts about an <LOCATION> American-Israeli </LOCATION> deal being hatched for south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Once the investigation of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> is over, we will place the details at the disposal of our ulema -LRB- Moslem clergy -RRB- to make of them whatever they deem fit. 4. We reiterate that we shall continue the investigation of this spy to complete his record, which is full of crimes. We shall put forward all the facts to our people at the proper time. 5. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s persistence in daily attacks to suppress the Islamic uprising of the struggling <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> people and the steadfast villages of <LOCATION> Jebel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amel </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> name for south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> -RRB-, and the shuttles of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> criminal <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to abort the achievements of this uprising will make us more determined to put this criminal <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> on trial. This will be done after the completion of the investigation to make the world understand that any hand that reaches out to hurt -LRB- our -RRB- pride, Islam and the dignity of our people will be chopped off. The Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>.

 Prince <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>, took in a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> glamour tour Tuesday that brought them face-to-face with a gregarious movie robot, bashful celebrities and curious everyday folk bearing flowers. The duke and duchess, midway through a 10-day <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> tour to promote <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, greeted such actors as <ORGANIZATION> Vincent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Price </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roddy </PERSON> <PERSON> McDowall </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> Brosnan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotten </PERSON>. `` I think they were modern and literate and good-mannered and were handsome people. I loved being here,'' <PERSON> Cotten </PERSON> said after pausing with the royal couple at the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brosnan </PERSON> were visibly nervous, and humbled, by the meeting. `` It gives one butterflies,'' <PERSON> Brosnan </PERSON> said afterward. `` I was n't sure about bowing correctly I did n't know what to say.'' <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON> said later that he realized that `` for them it was like doing a scene over and over about 100 times. ... It is such a grueling schedule for them. They could n't have been more charming.'' The couple had started the day earlier at the <ORGANIZATION> Showscan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> a special effects studio in <LOCATION> Culver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` Greetings, salutations, hello,'' said `` Number 5,'' the impish robot from the movie `` Short Circuit.'' Attended by a half dozen technicians, the robot presented <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> with a bouquet, then spun on its triangular tank treads and introduced <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> to company officials. As <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> entered the building, `` Number 5'' commented: `` Nice hat.'' `` Thank you,'' replied the duchess, who also accepted a bouquet and a rose from fans in the small crowd outside the studio. The wildest scene in the studio visit consisted of two hair-raising rides for <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> in something called the `` dynamic animation theater.'' The prince and seven other people took seats on a hydraulically operated platform in front of a curved movie screen as a film shot from the perspective of the front seat in a roller coaster roared by. For the next several minutes, they were jolted up and down, backward and forward, and finally brought to a lurching halt. The duchess, who is three months pregnant, watched from a director's chair, telling her husband later, `` You looked very funny. The royal couple also saw a breakaway bottle smashed harmlessly over the head of their private secretary, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Dwyer </PERSON>.

 Moslem kidnappers freed two Scandinavian relief workers Tuesday, nearly a month after they had been kidnapped in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and left a note saying the hostages were `` proved innocent.'' Swede <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stening </PERSON>, 44, and Norwegian <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorgensen </PERSON>, 58, employees of the U.N. Relief and <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, were released in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Norwegian Charge d'Affaires <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Raeder </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, `` I saw them. They looked a little bit pale but in fairly good condition.'' Reporters in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> workers were freed at 8 p.m. and turned over to <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Salah </PERSON>, a representative of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. They said <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> took the two to Sunni Moslem leader <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Saad </PERSON>, whose militia controls <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Militiamen </PERSON> then drove the former captives to Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and delivered them to <ORGANIZATION> UNRWA </ORGANIZATION> security chief <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Carolan </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> UNRWA </ORGANIZATION>'s acting director, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fennessy </PERSON>, said the two were taken to a hotel in <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to rest. He expressed `` the relief and satisfaction of my colleagues and myself'' that the Scandinavians `` have at last been released and are unharmed.'' Stening and <PERSON> Jorgensen </PERSON> were abducted near <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> on Feb. 5. Their release reduced the number of foreign hostages held by extremists in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to 23. Also on Tuesday, a statement purporting to be from the kidnappers of Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> will be put on `` trial'' for espionage when his captors finish questioning him. There was no way of authenticating the statement. Members of a group called the Revolutionary Cells kidnapped the Scandinavians. In a handwritten Arabic statement delivered to a Western news agency in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> late Tuesday the group announced the two men had been released. A photograph of the Scandinavians accompanied the statement. It did not say what they had been accused of, but in earlier statements the group claimed the men were involved with the intelligence service of an unidentified foreign power. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials blamed the abductions on Palestinians acting individually without a political motive. Government officials in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> expressed gratitude to those who had helped secure freedom for the two. The one-paragraph statement from the kidnappers said: `` After the two employees were proved innocent, they were released. We ask <ORGANIZATION> UNRWA </ORGANIZATION> to reverse its decision to freeze its activities, and we remind them that we will not allow suspicious elements to use international agencies for cover.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency, which cares for an estimated 280,000 Palestinian refugees in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, suspended most of its medical, social and educational services after the abductions. The statement on <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was delivered to a Western news agency in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> without a picture of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION>, who was abducted Feb. 17 near Tyre. It was typewritten in Arabic and signed Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, the name of the group that claimed responsibility for abducting <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, 43. The statement said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s tough response to 12 weeks of Palestinian riots in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace shuttle of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> `` make us more determined to try this criminal, <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>.'' It repeated the claim that <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent. It was the third statement issued since the Marine from <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, was seized by gunmen who stopped his <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> car on the coastal highway. The Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> is believed made up of pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems. It has claimed responsibility for kidnapping 12 Lebanese Jews in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> since 1984 and says it killed eight of them. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> is one of nine American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, kidnapped March 16, 1985. The Marine colonel was the commander of 76 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers from 16 nations who monitor truce violations on the <LOCATION> Lebanon-Israel </LOCATION> border under a 1949 armistice agreement. His observers are attached to the 5,800-member <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> that was sent into southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1978 as a buffer between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas. The statement about <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said in part: `` The criminal <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is moving inside and outside <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to ensure a quick release of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> so that he will not reveal secrets and make confessions. But we declare today that we have uncovered solid facts about an <LOCATION> American-Israeli </LOCATION> deal being hatched for south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it had no comment except to repeat the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position `` that all the hostages should be released immediately and unconditionally.'' In <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sten </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON> said of the release of the <ORGANIZATION> UNRWA </ORGANIZATION> workers, `` I would like to express the government's great gratitude to all who have helped achieve this result.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Gro </PERSON> <PERSON> Harlem </PERSON> <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> issued a statement in <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION> saying: `` On behalf of the government and myself I'm extremely relieved and happy with the release of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorgensen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and his Swedish collegue <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stening </PERSON>.'' In <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> UNRWA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Stening </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jorgensen </PERSON> probably would travel to <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> where the agency has its headquarters. He also said the agency will `` still have to think about our operations'' in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, adding: `` We have to have certain guarantees of safety.''

<TEXT>
 Eight bodies have been recovered so far since a small craft carrying about 45 illegal aliens from the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> capsized near <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, authorities said Tuesday. Authorities and a survivor say most of the 45 made it to shore safely after the boat sank Sunday night near this small fishing village, about 85 miles west of the capital city of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>. Police Lt. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> said two bodies were found Monday and six more were pulled from the ocean near the beach Tuesday. Strong waves hampered the search, which was expected to resume Wednesday. Police Maj. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gracia </PERSON> said the Dominican residents boarded the craft on the east coast of <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> Saturday night, when the weather was clear for the 90-mile trip across Mona Passage. As they neared <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, large waves overturned the boat about 180 feet from shore. The boat was estimated to be 20 to 30 feet long. One survivor was hospitalized and another was taken into custody Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in this <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> commonwealth. <LOCATION> Aguada </LOCATION> has been the landing site for many boats bringing illegal aliens to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> in search of a better life.

<TEXT>
 Soldiers with tear gas fought protesters hurling stones in the poor, densely populated <LOCATION> Capotillo </LOCATION> neighborhood of the capital Tuesday. Ten people were hurt and about 50 were arrested. The disturbances began with a strike to protest increases in the cost of living. Schools and stores in the neighborhood closed, but traffic and activity were normal in the rest of <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Domingo </LOCATION>. Elsewhere in this <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nation of 6 million, residents of <LOCATION> Azua </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Barahona </PERSON> provinces south of the capital burned tires, blocked roads and stoned businesses and cars. In similar protests last week, five people were killed and 20 injured in eight of the 26 provinces of the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, which shares the island of Hispaniola with <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. The unrest is the worst faced by President <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON> since he took office in August 1986. The inflation rate is running at about 30 percent a year. The foreign exchange value of the peso meanwhile has skidded. It takes 5.3 pesos to buy one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar, about 72 percent more than the 3.85-1 ratio several months ago. Many people are furious that a 5-gallon container of cooking oil has doubled to 84 pesos. Taxi drivers resent paying 3.6 pesos for a gallon of gas that a few months ago cost 3 pesos. A one-pound steAP Business Writer = <LOCATION> NEW </LOCATION> <LOCATION> YORK </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Aluminum maker <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> sued its chairman for millions of dollars Tuesday, alleging he violated securities law by improperly engaging in profitable short-term buying and selling of company stock The suit against <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clore </PERSON> came a day after the reclusive British investor agreed to sell his 27 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurwitz </PERSON>, a move that appeared to irritate <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> officials and signaled management turbulence at the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>, Calif.-based company. Neither <PERSON> Clore </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Hurwitz </PERSON> are considered familiar with the aluminum business. <PERSON> Clore </PERSON> acquired his position at <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> after a lengthy takeover struggle last year. <PERSON> Hurwitz </PERSON>'s intentions toward <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> remain unclear. Asked if it was considered unusual that a company would sue its own chairman, <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Irelan </PERSON> said: `` It's the first time we've done it. In a statement, <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> said its suit filed in a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> federal court resulted from <PERSON> Clore </PERSON>'s disclosures in a <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> filing Monday about his sale of stock to a Hurwitz-controlled company, Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> Maxxam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> contended the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> disclosures showed <PERSON> Clore </PERSON> and his affiliates made about $ 4 million in undisclosed profits via so-called `` short-swing trading'' _ trading done within a six-month period _ of <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> stock Under federal securities law, a company or its stockholders are entitled to recover such profits from a director or officer who engages in short-swing trading. <PERSON> Clore </PERSON>, who usually resides in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, could not be reached for comment on the lawsuit, part of a rapid series of events concerning the stock of the aluminum producer. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said it was selling 1.39 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> stock to <ORGANIZATION> Maxxam </ORGANIZATION> for $ 16.68 million or $ 12 a share. Combined with the 6.2 million shares acquired from <PERSON> Clore </PERSON>, plus an option to buy his 8.2 million convertible preferred <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> shares, the shares purchased from <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> would give <ORGANIZATION> Maxxam </ORGANIZATION> about one-third of <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION>'s approximately 45 million shares outstanding. Wall Street's reaction reflected skepticism about a possible takeover move. In composite <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> fell 12 -LCB- cents a share to $ 11.75, after rising $ 1.12 -LCB- in the previous session. <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement Monday it would have preferred that <PERSON> Clore </PERSON> had sold his stock to a broader range of investors, reflecting concern about what <ORGANIZATION> Maxxam </ORGANIZATION> intends to do with its stake. <ORGANIZATION> Maxxam </ORGANIZATION> officials said it was premature to speculate on whether it would attempt to acquire more. <PERSON> Clore </PERSON>'s maneuvering to sell his <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> shares came against a background of heavy pressure on him to cut losses that stemmed from the October stock market crash. If <PERSON> Clore </PERSON> had n't found a buyer by a Monday deadline, he could have faced default on loans he had obtained by using <PERSON> Kaiser </PERSON> stock as collateral. After the stock plunged in October, lenders wanted repayment. His sale of stock came as the company was rebounding from six straight years of losses. <PERSON> Kaiser </PERSON> has sold its chemical, oil and gas businesses, slashed debt and concentrated on its core aluminum business.

<HEAD>170 Families Cannot Leave Because They Allegedly Know State
Secrets</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>

 Authorities told a group of activists Tuesday that 170 Soviet Jewish families can not be allowed to emigrate because members have been exposed to state secrets, a member of the group said. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kislik </PERSON>, who has been trying to leave for 15 years, said 10 Jews from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> met with officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. On Jan. 20 the group had given <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> Siderov </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> official, a list of more than 300 families denied permission to emigrate and requested a review. <PERSON> Siderov </PERSON> promised an answer within a month. The activists returned Feb. 21, were told the review was not ready and were asked to come back Tuesday, <PERSON> Kislik </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. They met with <PERSON> Siderov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorkovluk </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s propaganda department and officials of the Office of Visas and Registrations and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, he said. From the list of 300 families, <PERSON> Kislik </PERSON> reported, the officials said 25 people had been authorized to emigrate. He said 20 had received notification since the list was drawn up Jan. 1. About 80 other people were refused exit visas because parents or spouses have not certified that they have no financial claims, <PERSON> Kislik </PERSON> said. Soviet regulations require an applicant for emigration to furnish such a guarantee. <PERSON> Kislik </PERSON> said some families were refused for emigration because they do not have close enough relatives in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which `` fully contradicted'' what Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> told him last month in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told reporters Feb. 22, after meeting with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, that the Soviet minister promised `` flexibility'' in applying rules that require applicants to have close relatives abroad. He said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> also told him `` categorically'' that the only barrier to emigration is past work involving state secrets. Many people whom the government alleges were exposed to state secrets say they saw the information years or decades ago and that it does not compromise the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` I last worked in atomic science 22 years ago and they are refusing me because of that reason even today,'' <PERSON> Kislik </PERSON> said. He added that the officials indicated they would meet with the Jews again to discuss the cases of 20 Soviet Jews who have heart conditions, cancer or other ailments and who want to leave. `` We also gave them a list of people from 60 to 82 years old who want to emigrate,'' he said. In February, Soviet authorities allowed 723 Jews to emigrate, according to the Geneva-based agency that helps the emigrants resettle. That was a slight increase from the January total of 658. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Intergovernmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Migration </ORGANIZATION>, Jewish emigration from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> last year reached 8,011, its highest level since 1981.

 <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was locked in a tight race with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Tuesday night in fractional returns from <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s Republican presidential primary, a low-key, low-stakes tuneup for Super Tuesday <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had an early advantage over <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the Democratic race. Sen. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was flush with endorsements in his effort to challenge the vice president in his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> backyard. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, in the state with the fewest blacks in the nation, hoped to finish a strong second to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as he did last weekend in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, the big winner here in 1984, was far, far back in the pack where he has been stuck all year. The elections were `` beauty-contest'' primaries. <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s national convention delegates wo n't be apportioned until next month in party caucuses, and the candidates have practically ignored the state to concentrate on the South The primary took place on Town Meeting Day when <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s 328,466 voters decided town budgets, road repairs and a host of other local issues. With just a handful of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s 262 precincts reporting, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had 288 and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> 287. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, whose supporters said they were focusing on the April caucuses, had 61 votes. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> was not active in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and had just 38 votes.

But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> has been active in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> since his 1984 presidential campaign and prompted an uneasy mixture of concern and admiration from the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> organization. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> hoped to do well in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> to follow up a strong showing last weekend in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and demonstrate he can win broad support from people of all races. `` The issue of another person's skin, ought not to be an issue,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> of the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign Among the Republicans, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had the strongest organization, but <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was helped by heavyweight endorsements from Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> and former Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Snelling </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s primary was overshadowed by next Tuesday's elections in which 20 states will apportion hundreds of delegates. The only thing at stake in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> was news media attention, bragging rights and the Bush-Dukakis regional winning streak. They both already have won the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary and the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> caucuses and have high hopes next week in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>.

 Minority students drew up a contract Tuesday to end the eight-day takeover of a <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> building that was held to protest racism at the private liberal arts school. `` We all want it over,'' said <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Fearman </PERSON>, a spokesman for the 40 black, Hispanic, Indian and other minority students who have occupied a dormitory office since Feb. 23. A tentative agreement was hammered out late Monday in meetings with the school's president, <ORGANIZATION> Adele </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Simmons </ORGANIZATION>, and two other administrators. Students drew up the formal contract Tuesday and college officials were expected to sign it Wednesday. Specifics of the contract were not released Tuesday. Protesters said they expected to continue holding the <ORGANIZATION> Dakin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> office until Wednesday despite the apparent agreement. Among the demands Dean of Faculty <PERSON> Penina </PERSON> <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> said the administration agreed to was the hiring of a full-time adviser for the campus group that occupied the building, Students of Underrepresented Cultures. The school also agreed to allow a professor to serve part-time as dean of multicultural affairs and to try to win grants to increase the number of Third World books in the library, she said. The college was founded in 1965 as an alternative to the traditional education offered at nearby <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Holyoke </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION> colleges and <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION>. Students design their own courses of study and advance through three divisional examinations requiring them to complete individual research projects. About 100 of <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION>'s 1,100 students are minorities. Two weeks earlier, an occupation sparked by campus racial violence ended at at <ORGANIZATION> UMass </ORGANIZATION> when Chancellor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> agreed to demands including increase funding of minority student programs. Meanwhile, in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Discrimination </ORGANIZATION> has found probable cause in a complaint by <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON>, 54, a black professor at <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, alleging he was denied a 10-year teaching contract in 1986 because of race. The panel will attempt to resolve dispute or, failing that, conduct public hearings, <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON>, a music professor, said he had worked under short contracts since he was hired in 1979 and in 1985 had won backing of faculty, students and the college appointments committee for a 10-year appointment. The college cited complaints that <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON> often was unavailable to students, submitted evaluations late and had `` offered little leadership in the music program, although he was the senior member,'' according to <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON>'s report. No blacks have been granted 10-year contracts, the longest the college provides, <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON> said in his report. The school does not offer tenure. Six of the 86 professors at the college are black, he said.

 The Post Office on Tuesday began postmarking nearly all letters mailed in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> with the words `` Jesus is Alive!'' as part of a private arrangement financed by an evangelist. Jewish leaders criticized the Christian cancellation as potentially offensive. The special postmark, which also contains a small cross, will last six weeks and was paid for by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Slennet </PERSON>, who sells religious literature at two bookstores in <LOCATION> Southend-on-Sea </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> God </PERSON> told him to buy the postmark. The state-owned Post Office said <PERSON> Slennet </PERSON> paid the equivalent of $ 88,500 for the privilege of having every letter mailed through 68 of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 69 sorting offices stamped `` Jesus is Alive!'' The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> has adopted various methods of boosting revenue under Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Conservative government, which believes that state-owned services should pay for themselves. Receiving the postmark will be all mail _ including that sent abroad _ excluding parcels, periodicals and those letters stamped by businesses that have their own franking facilities. Nearly 52 million letters are mailed daily in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. `` The printing of this slogan in no way confirms <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> approval of its contents,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>. `` The slogan is not considered to be contentious.'' <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, spokesman for Lord <PERSON> Jakobovits </PERSON>, the chief rabbi of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, said his office was `` flooded with phone calls'' after news of the slogan appeared in newspapers Tuesday. `` We recognize that this is a Christian country and we have the utmost respect for the primacy for the church,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said in an interview. However, `` we do fear that the slogan that will be carried is by implication addressed to non-Christians and could well cause offense and resentment. We've made our feelings known to the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. Rabbi <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON>, chairman of the Assembly of Rabbis of the <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Britain </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` This country allows me freedom of religion, and an official organization should not have accepted such a commission that will infringe not only upon my rights but the rights of other non-Christians.'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said his office was aware of `` a number of complaints.'' Asked if these had caused any change of heart, he said: `` I've had no indication of that.'' He said no complaints had been received from other non-Christian groups. However, the British <ORGANIZATION> Humanist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a national association for the non-religious, said the decision showed `` insensitive disregard'' for other beliefs. `` Imagine the furor if we had asked to have ` <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> is Dead' printed on hundreds of millions of letters,'' said association spokesman <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Horwood </PERSON> He said he is writing the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> asking that the postmark be withdrawn. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> official said the chance of something similar in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was unlikely. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Rustin </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Stamp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Branch </ORGANIZATION>, said limits are strict on special cancellations and religious messages are excluded. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Post Office regulations require paid messages to be `` non-controversial, non-political and likely to be generally acceptable to the public,'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Slennet </PERSON>, 41, said he got the idea five years ago listening to a sermon in which the preacher talked about collecting stamps and postmarks. `` The Lord has since confirmed to me in various ways that this is the right thing to do,'' he said in an interview. `` In 1986 that small quiet voice we hear when <PERSON> God </PERSON> speaks said ` postmark'.'' He said that he has informed Christian groups around the country of his idea and received contributions toward paying for it. Slennet belongs to Intercessors for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, an evangelical organization. He said the slogan was chosen in the spirit of Easter. The <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> is n't printing the slogan because it already had been booked for one commemorating <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588.

<TEXT>
 The government Tuesday proposed a bill to outlaw foreign funding of political activity, a move that could cripple anti-apartheid groups and churches thus far spared from the new crackdown on opposition. No court challenge of the restrictions would be allowed. Last week, the government banned 18 predominantly black organizations from political activity, including the largest anti-apartheid coalition and largest labor federation. Leading anti-apartheid clergymen vowed Tuesday _ before the new bill was introduced _ that the churches would take over some of the programs of the banned groups and more aggressively confront the government. The new legislation, called `` The Promotion of Orderly Politics Bill,'' would prohibit all organizations from receiving money from abroad for political purposes and would empower the justice minister to seize foreign funds received by certain groups. His powers would be indefinitely retroactive. The foreign funds provision was not expected to hurt right-wing organizations, which receive most of their money from donations from within <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. However, another section of the bill could apply to right-wing white supremacist groups that oppose the government's limited apartheid reforms. It sets a penalty of two years in jail or a fine of about $ 2,000 for anyone who `` says or does anything'' to foment hostility or violence between different racial, cultural or religious groups. The penalties would apply to anyone who displays a banner, emblem or slogan deemed to convey such hostility, and also to anyone who attends a gathering where such items are displayed. The South African Council of Churches, which includes most major Protestant denominations and is engaged in civil rights work, has received more than 90 percent of its funds from abroad in recent years. The <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> cooperates with the council of churches but receives substantial overseas funds separately. The Rev. <PERSON> Smangiliso </PERSON> <PERSON> Mkhatshwa </PERSON>, secretary-general of the Southern African <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, said the bill might be difficult to enforce. `` If the church says supporting the families of detainees and paying legal fees is the work of love, the work of evangelism, it is difficult to see how the government can define for the church what is pastoral and what is political,'' he said. In Parliament, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzman </PERSON>, veteran member of the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, condemned the arrests Monday of prominent clergymen who were protesting the government crackdown. About 25 church leaders, including Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, and 125 other protesters were detained briefly after riot policeman blocked them from marching to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> with a petition protesting the bans on opposition groups. After the most prominent clergymen were placed in police vehicles, a water cannon was sprayed on the other protesters, who were kneeling and singing hymns. Mrs. <PERSON> Suzman </PERSON> said Tuesday police should have allowed the march to proceed, `` thus avoiding all that sensational publicity that has resulted in adverse headlines across the world and has added further fuel to the campaign for sanctions. This government has a death wish.'' Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said the clergymen had defied a request to disperse and `` scandalously provoked'' police. `` We have to once again take the blame for the misconduct of people who hide behind the cloth of sanctimony,'' he said. One of the arrested churchmen, Roman Catholic Archibishop <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Naidoo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, said in an interview Tuesday that he and his colleagues considered it their duty to intensify the churches' challenge of the government. `` There is going to be in this country a continuing moral confrontation,'' he said. He predicted the authorities would deal cautiously with defiant clergymen because `` they are intelligent enough to realize they are dealing here with a great moral force ... and the moral sensibilities of people all over the world.'' The government has backed off before in the face of concerted church resistance, the last time in 1986 when many of the same ministers arrested Monday had gathered at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> George </LOCATION>'s Anglican Cathderal to defy a ban on calling for the release of detainees The prohibition was not enforced and was dropped from the next issue of emergency regulations. The Rev. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, dean of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> George </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION>, said it was significant that no one in Monday's march had been charged and all were freed without bail. `` I think they're embarrassed by this; they do n't want to put archbishops in jail. But they make their own nooses for their own necks.''

 One of two <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> men accidentally killed by their own bomb has been linked to at least 25 killings since 1979 and headed the police most-wanted list, the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> news </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday.

<TEXT>
 Republican presidential candidate <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> on Tuesday cited second-hand testimony from a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee hearing 21 years ago as documentation that Soviet intermediate-range missiles are based in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. However, several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Tuesday the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> military has some surface-to-surface missiles in its inventory, but none has a nuclear warhead and none could reach the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> even if they did. The former religious broadcaster said the information indicates a `` loophole'' in the U.S.-Soviet arms control treaty awaiting ratification in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> quoted 1967 testimony by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bethel </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> who said Cuban refugees had told him of seeing missiles, and one of the refugees, identified only as Mr. <PERSON> Apud </PERSON>, who swore <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> soldiers let him know about missiles aimed at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> before he left in 1966. Neither man testified he had personally seen the missiles, the transcript indicates. The testimony was given to the Judiciary subcommittee to investigate the administration of the Internal Security Act and other internal security laws. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> read portions of it to supporters at a breakfast here and during a rally the night before in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` I've been accused of bringing funny facts,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> gathering. `` Ladies and gentlemen, the clear eyewitness, sworn testimony of witnesses before a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> is not funny facts. ... This is documented evidence.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s assertion that there are missiles based in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has been denied by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, congressional defense experts and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> president <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. Several defense and administration officials were asked Tuesday about <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s claim. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they did not want to become involved in the presidential race, said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has about five dozen Frog-4 and Frog-7 battlefield missiles, date to the 1960s. The Frog-7, when originally introduced by the Soviets, could carry either a conventional or nuclear warhead, `` but we're confident no nuclear warheads ever went to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> for that missile and it does n't have any range anyway,'' said one source who requested anonymity According to the reference book `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s Weapon Systems,'' the Frog-7 has a range of only about 43 miles _ or half the distance between <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Moreover, the rocket has no guidance system to direct it to a specific target. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said last month that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has been under extensive surveillance since the 1962 missile crisis and there was `` no evidence'' any other nuclear weaponry had ever been deployed there by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> concentrated heavily on the Cuban-American vote for the March 8 Super Tuesday primary during a two-day swing through <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> rally drew little more than half of the 1,500 people that campaign organizers had predicted in a show of the candidate's strength among Hispanics At a news conference following the breakfast, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> refused to say how he obtained the missile testimony transcript. `` How I got it is my business, but the thing that's important is that it's available in the records of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> government,'' he said. `` And, frankly, I think it shows that the staff work by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was not adequate on the INF treaty because there's clearly a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> loophole.'' A Cuban refugee who claims he saw a variety of missiles, including long-range surface-to-surface missiles, there as late as 1985 said he met Thursday in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. Copies of a Spanish-language newspaper, <PERSON> Diario </PERSON> <PERSON> Libre </PERSON>, with a headline proclaiming `` YES, PAT! YOU'RE RIGHT!'' and maps drawn by the refugee to pinpoint the missile sites were distributed to campaign supporters throughout his <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> visit. The man identified himself only as <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, saying he feared revealing his full name would result in retribution against family members still in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. He said he was an agricultural planner and had access to aerial photographs and to areas of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> where the missiles were based. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said he could n't vouch for the authenticity of the newspaper's account of the refugee's story. `` I'm not saying I have other than this proof,'' he said, referring to the subcommittee transcript. `` It's coming to me from many, many people now, people who are aware of it. `` But the issue is not can we prove or can we not prove. The issue is verification We have a treaty. There's a loophole in the treaty. We must put in verification of the Cuban missile sites.'' He told reporters the only way to verify his claim was to personally go to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and look for the missiles. But, responding to a question, he said he would decline an invitation to do so should it be extended by <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, who he has described as `` a butcher and a tyrant.'' In the subcommittee transcript, <PERSON> Apud </PERSON> said he was told by <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> soldiers he had known for many years that the missiles were nicknamed `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Left,'' `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Right,'' and `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Central.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> quoted <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>'s acknowledgement, in response to questioning by Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, that numerous refugees had told him they had seen missiles left in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> after the Cuban Missile Crisis and new ones constructed in 1964. <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> testified he could not state with certainty that intermediate or intercontinental ballistic missiles were in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, but that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also could n't be certain they were n't there

 The son of late President <PERSON> Gamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> was quoted Tuesday as saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> are defaming him and his brothers to `` settle old accounts'' with his father. The Kuwaiti newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Anbaa </ORGANIZATION> said the interview conducted in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, was the first with <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> since criminal charges were filed against him in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. It quoted him as saying he would return to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> for trial even though he faced possible execution. <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> is among 20 men charged in connection with four shooting attacks on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Israeli diplomats and embassy workers between 1984 and 1987. Two Israelis were killed and six Israelis and two Americans were wounded. He and the other defendants are accused of membership in a clandestine group called <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s Revolution. The indictment demands the death penalty for <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>, 38, and 10 other defendants, and prison terms of up to life for the others. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> has said it is trying to extradite <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> for trial as one of three founders of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s Revolution and its main financial backer. The group is committed to ending the Israeli presence in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> commitment to the 1979 peace treaty with the Jewish state. <ORGANIZATION> Al-Anbaa </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> had offered political refugee status to <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> but he refused, saying: `` My father never imagined being such in any country and preferred to die while fighting his enemies rather than accept that. Therefore I am determined to return to <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> because death in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> is much better than living elsewhere.'' <PERSON> Gamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> led a bloodless military coup that ousted King <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> in 1952, and ruled as a fierce nationalist until his death in 1970. While he was in office, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> faced the 1956 invasion by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>'s successor, the late <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>, led the country through the 1973 war with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and signed the peace treaty with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1979. In referring to `` a defamation campaign'' in the Egyptian press against him and his two younger brothers, according to <ORGANIZATION> Al-Anbaa </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> said it was `` not separate from the hostile American and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> blueprint which has been employed over the past 36 years with the aim of obliterating <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>'s legendary place in the hearts of the Arab masses.'' `` The defamation campaign being launched against me and my brothers is but an American and Israeli attempt to settle old accounts,'' he said. `` Those who failed to face President <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> for 18 years of his rule and to eradicate his name from the conscience of the Egyptian masses for 18 years after his death now return to launch their campaigns.''

<HEAD>U.N. Report: Rights Violations Continue in Chile</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> report released Tuesday said human rights violations including torture and abductions continue in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> but the overall situation is improving. The report presented to the 43-nation <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said that since February 1985 `` there have been important changes which have improved the human rights situation... but much still remains to be done. It said specific problems are the increasing scope of military courts and `` violent and criminal activities of private gangs and terrorists.'' Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> has headed <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s military government since the coup that ousted the elected government of Marxist President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> in September 1973. The report was prepared by <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> jurist <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Volio </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> under a mandate from the commission. <PERSON> Volio </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiminez </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> in December and met with government officials and human rights activists. He wrote that `` a state of violence affecting fundamental rights continues to exist in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, despite the government's general attitude condemning such violations.'' The report said many citizens are victims of intimidation by `` supposedly private individuals'' seeking to `` inspire terror in circles opposed to the political status quo.'' Such intimidation is `` generally the work of private gangs ... having the secret support of some public authority,'' it said. Harassment, mainly of people who recently returned from exile, has become more `` articulate, blatant and general,'' the report said. It also said the government has taken measures to try to prevent the torture of detainees, but `` torture is still practiced although, according to non-governmental sources, this revolting practice may have declined in terms of numbers.'' The report noted an increase in the number of civilians tried in military courts and the `` irregular conduct'' of those courts. It listed five cases of `` involuntary disappearances'' in 1987, following a year when no cases were reported, and said the recurrence is `` an especially serious situation.'' On the positive side, <PERSON> Volio </PERSON> reported the government since February 1985 had permitted the return of about 4,000 Chileans who were in forced exile. It said that according to the government, 350 Chileans are still living in forced exile but non-governmental sources put the figure at 583. The report cited the cases of nine people killed in 1985-86 that have not been solved and said one investigating magistrate complained about lack of police cooperation and said he had received death threats. `` This situation makes things look gloomy for the cause of human rights,'' it added.

 A federal judge Tuesday gave the three major television networks the go-ahead to take exit polls at <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> voting places during the Super Tuesday presidential preference primaries next week. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> had sued state and <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> election officials to stop enforcement of a 1985 law prohibiting exit polls or public opinion surveys within 250 feet of a polling place. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> Tuesday issued a preliminary injunction stopping the state from enforcing the new law beyond 25 feet of buildings in which polling places are located. The ruling, which came after a hearing on the lawsuit Monday, allows the networks to conduct the exit polls during the March 8 primaries, as long as their poll takers are stationed no closer than 25 feet from the door. Hall indicated he would rule later on the networks' contention that the law violates the Constitution's First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech and of the press. While the state `` has a legitimate interest in protecting the ` sanctity of the polling place,''' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> wrote in Tueday's ruling, it appears the 250 foot prohibition on exit polls `` is not ` narrowly tailored' to accomplish that goal in the ` least restrictive means available,''' as required by previous court rulings on free speech issues. A more limited ban, keeping exit pollers out of polling places and 25 feet away from their doors, `` would likely satisfy even the most rigorous constitutional scrutiny,'' he wrote. `` We're delighted by the results,'' said <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, an attorney representing the networks. `` It will make it possible for more people to have more information more quickly about the election results and their meaning on Super Tuesday.'' <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, the assistant secretary of state in charge of elections, said Tuesday that copies of the judge's order will be sent to county election officials for relay to their precinct managers before the primaries next week. In exit polling, survey takers ask a random sample of voters leaving the polling place to fill out a written list of questions about whom they voted for and what issues are important to them, as well as such information as their age, sex and economic status. During testimony in Monday's hearing, <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitofsky </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>' election and survey unit, testified that exit polls are by far the most accurate and the quickest way to gauge what groups of people are voting for which candidate. But, he said, the 250-foot distance limitation effectively banned public opinion surveys of people leaving polling places because the surveyor is too far away from the exit to be able to intercept the voters randomly. The law had been enacted because elections officials, mostly in metropolitan <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, had complained that exit poll takers intimidated voters, according to testimony from former state Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Bray </PERSON>, who chaired the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> when it considered the measure.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> met with the South African ambassador Tuesday and said he conveyed the `` outrage felt by freedom-loving peoples everywhere'' at the recent clampdown of anti-apartheid factions in that country. The Democratic presidential candidate said he objected to <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>'s restriction of the activities of anti-apartheid organizations and Monday's arrest of Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> and other top religious leaders. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told a news conference later that the ambassador, <PERSON> Piet </PERSON> <PERSON> G.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Koornhof </PERSON>, asked for a follow-up meeting with Rep. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, D-Calif., who attended the meeting and who is sponsoring legislation on sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> because of its apartheid policy of racial separation The Democrat also called on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to take several steps against the <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> regime. He said he informed the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> ambassador of his proposals, which include: _ `` Comprehensive international economic and financial sanctions on apartheid.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations and banks should be ordered to leave <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. _ Invocation by the administration of a special session of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to seek international support for such sanctions. _ Broadcasting of news from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> via `` a new Radio Free South Africa.'' _ Support for the so-called frontline states around <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and aid to build rail corridor railways so that <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> would not be dependent on South African trade routes. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he attempted to telephone President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on the eve of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Tuesday departure for a <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he spoke with national security adviser <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> and urged that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> seek support from the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> proposals. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Coulton </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> agreed the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> situation would be raised at the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> meeting. Campaigning earlier in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, one of the Super Tuesday states that holds its primary next week, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spoke to a downtown <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> rally and blasted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for using `` government power to take from the poor and give to the rich.'' Of his recent second-place finish in the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> caucuses, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told the crowd of a few hundred, `` There are signs we are growing every day.'' He also walked through <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>'s trendy <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> Market food bazaar shaking hands with the lunchtime crowds. He stood on a large plant pot and shouted over the din, urging the crowd to vote for him. Later, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> flew to his hometown of <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and proclaimed to a church full of people, `` It's good to be home.'' `` I'm a son of the South ... I know the South and its ways,'' he said.

<HEAD>BBC Says Government Drops Objections to Program on Security</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday the government has withdrawn its objections to a radio program that included interviews with intelligence officials. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government won a court order in December preventing the broadcasting of the first program in the planned three-part series, `` My Country: Right or Wrong.'' The government argued that the series, dealing with the tug of war between state secrecy and freedom of information, could harm national security. Publicly funded <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> said the series portrays the work of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s intelligence agencies and did not reveal anything an enemy could not already know. The government withdrew its objections to the program after its lawyers received a transcript of it from the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION>, the company said. The second and third programs have yet to be recorded. `` I am glad that we will be able to transmit this program,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Birt </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy director general. `` I am only sorry it has been long delayed.'' He did not say when the program will be broadcast. The High Court judge who approved the gag order had said the government was properly concerned that nine former and serving intelligence officials interviewed for the series may have broken their oaths of secrecy. <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleary </PERSON> said Tuesday night: `` The <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> initially refused to turn over the transcripts to the government, arguing that would amount to pre-censorship. But the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> later, during the legal process, had to provide the transcripts as part of its defense evidence.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Conservative government had used the argument of lifetime confidentiality by security agents to prevent the publication in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> of `` Spycatcher,'' a book by former agent <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who now lives in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. The book has been published in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'s investment manager allocated stock-trading profits to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s brokerage accounts under a procedure that a senator said Tuesday raises questions of `` possible financial favors or gifts'' to the Cabinet member. In a report by its Democratic majority staff, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management said stock trader <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> pooled <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s money with that of several other customers in 1985 and 1986 and, after completing stock trades, assigned profits or losses to the attorney general's account The report said it appears that in seven instances, <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> allocated stock trades to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s account in amounts exceeding the balance available in the account to pay for those trades. In the seven instances, the amount of the stock trades exceeded the balances in <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s account by $ 5,000 to $ 140,000. <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> turned a profit of nearly $ 40,000 for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> on a $ 50,000 investment in just 23 stock trades over a 19-month span. <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s longtime friend who is under indictment in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> scandal, in five of the trades was one of the customers whose money was pooled with that of the attorney general. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> introduced <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>, who became the attorney general's financial adviser in May 1985. <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> `` was n't investing Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s money, as much as he was assigning profits and losses to the accounts of Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and his other clients at his own discretion,'' Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., the subcommittee's chairman, said in a letter to the Office of Government Ethics <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>'s `` assignment of stock transactions retroactively to those accounts appears to have no relationship to the amount of money in those accounts,'' <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> continued. `` Because he did not allocate winners and losers to his clients' accounts until after the fact, he was effectively able to assign greater benefits to some _ including apparently Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> on numerous occasions. The procedure `` raises questions about possible financial favors or gifts, about possible conflict of interest, -LRB- and -RRB- about the judgment of the attorney general in being involved in a partnership with a director of a company -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- with Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had directly assisted when he was working in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as counselor to the president,'' said <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> asked the ethics office for a formal finding as to whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has complied with federal regulations governing gifts and loans to public officials and whether he has violated an executive order prohibiting the appearance of a conflict of interest. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> said the issues raised by <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> were matters that had been fully examined in congressional hearings last July and that now are before the independent counsel studying <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s dealings with <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>. He said it would be inappropriate for the ethics office to get involved at this point. `` What Senator <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> is trying to do is wrap an 8-month old fish in today's paper,'' <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> said. `` All we have here is a highly partisan effort to grab another headline on this thing and keep the <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> pot boiling.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has acknowledged interceding on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> when the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, defense contractor was seeking a $ 32 million, no-bid contract to build small engines for the Army. Within months of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s intercession, <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> was awarded the work. The report said that in one instance, <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> bought and sold 5,000 shares of a new stock issue in <ORGANIZATION> Oliver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> worth $ 30,000 on Feb. 11, 1986. It was n't until the next day, however, that <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> instructed <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> where one of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s accounts was established, that 2,000 of the shares were to be recorded for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s account. The transaction gave <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> a profit of more than $ 1,700. In another instance, on Sept. 12, 1985, <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> allocated a purchase of $ 80,000 worth of stock in <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Properties </ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s account at the brokerage house of Bear, <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON> at a time when the account had a balance of only $ 51,000. The trade resulted in a profit of nearly $ 900. In a third instance, <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> bought and sold <ORGANIZATION> Firemans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock on Oct. 23, 1985. It was n't until mid-afternoon of the day he bought and sold it that <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> directed that 2,000 of the shares be assigned to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s account. That transaction earned <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> more than $ 900. <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> assigned purchases to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s and his other customers' accounts `` after it was known whether the purchase would yield a profit or loss. `` It appears that Mr. <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> was able to decide just which of his clients would get profits and which would get losses,'' the senator said in his letter to the ethics office. One of <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>'s lawyers, <PERSON> Cristina </PERSON> <PERSON> Arguedas </PERSON>, said that her client's stock trading has been examined at length by independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, who is conducting a criminal investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. She said the independent counsel has found no wrongdoing in connection with the stock trading. One of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s attorneys, <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON>, said the attorney general had set up a limited blind partnership with <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>'s company under which <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was kept unaware of any of the details of <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>'s stock trading <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> lost money on five of the 23 stock transactions. <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> was indicted Dec. 22 with longtime <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> friend <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and a business associate, <ORGANIZATION> R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kent </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, on racketeering, fraud and conspiracy charges in an alleged scheme to extract payments from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> in order to influence <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and other federal officials. All three have pleaded innocent. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s involvement with <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> has been under criminal investigation by independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> since last May 11. The attorney general has denied wrongdoing.

<HEAD>Judge Lifts Texas Ban of Florida Citrus</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge on Tuesday overturned the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> ban on <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> citrus fruit, and state officials began planning their next legal move against regulations allowing the shipments. The ban was imposed last month ban after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> lifted a 3 -LCB- - year-old federal quarantine on <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> citrus that was prompted by outbreaks of citrus canker in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> agriculture officials said the ban was necessary to protect <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' $ 65 million-a-year citrus industry from canker. The state now plans to seek an injunction against new federal rules that allow shipment of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> citrus meeting certain standards to other citrus-producing states, said <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodfin </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Nowlin </PERSON> said Tuesday that he lifted the state ban, imposed last month after the new federal rule took effect, because the federal regulation took precedence over the state rule. The ban was due to end March 12, when <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> officials planned to have gathered information on the federal rule and take some permanent action. `` We feel we need to do whatever we can to protect the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> citrus industry,'' <PERSON> Woodfin </PERSON> said. The injunction request will charge that the federal rule was issued abruptly and did not allow sufficient time to study its possible effects, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citrus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION>, a growers association, and <ORGANIZATION> Tuxedo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> shipper and grower, sued <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> last month to stop the emergency state quarantine. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> and Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> joined the court action. The lawsuit called the ban unconstitutional and invalid. It said the action would mean a loss of millions of dollars to the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> citrus industry. `` We expected this decision,'' <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> said. `` Federal rules and regulations supersede state rules and regulations as it pertains to plant matters. The law's a little different between plant and animal.'' Canker, which can seriously damage citrus plants and fruit, was found in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in 1984. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> officials said <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> producers must meet strict standards under the new federal regulation in order to ship fruit to citrus-producing states, including <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>, chief of the bureau of pest eradication for the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said he had never heard of canker being found on mature citrus fruit that was ready to be shipped. It would be difficult to transmit canker from fruit to citrus groves, he said.

<HEAD>Chancellor Raises Possibility Of New Elections Over Tax Reform</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The coalition government of Socialists and conservatives, already under strain because of the <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> affair, could collapse over tax reform, according to comments by Chancellor <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> on Tuesday. The coalition has been strained for months over President <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s World War II activities, and <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> said again Tuesday he would consider resigning if that issue continued to affect his government's work. But Socialist <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON>, speaking with reporters after a Cabinet session, dealt mainly with tax legislation. He said it was possible he would meet again this week with Vice Chancellor <PERSON> Alois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mock </PERSON> in a last-ditch effort to reach agreement on tax reform. Mock is chairman of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Austrian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, running as the conservative candidate, won the presidential election in June 1986. The term for the mainly titular presidency is for six years, and <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> has rejected critics' demands that he resign <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> said the question of new elections `` would lie close at hand'' if the tax dispute is not resolved. The last parliamentary elections were held on Nov. 23, 1986, for four-year terms. <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> was asked about early elections and he said, `` I do not seek them but I do not shy away from them either.'' Mock and <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> have had several inconclusive meetings on the proposed tax reform. The Socialists insist that a major gap in the budget can not be filled without imposing a tax on savings deposit interest. The conservatives strongly oppose such a tax. Some political observers have said the combined tax dispute and controversy over <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> may be too much for the coalition to survive. <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON>, criticizing <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, said it was not enough for the president to keep restating his position. He said <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> would have to contribute to resolving the crisis over his presidency `` in word and deed,'' but added he did not want to elaborate. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> served as a lieutenant in the German army in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION> during World War II. The World Jewish Congress and other groups say he was involved with army units that deported thousands of Jews and other people from the area to Nazi labor or death camps. An international commission of six historians, appointed by the Austrian government to investigate <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s past, said he was `` in close proximity'' to some Nazi atrocities in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION> and knew they were going on but made no attempt to prevent them. The report, released last month, did not support allegations that <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was involved in atrocities. But it left open the question of whether he was guilty of any crime. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general, has repeatedly denied any wrongdoings during the war.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Derbyshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> suggested a compromise Tuesday in its campaign to have 16th century <ORGANIZATION> Chesterfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> replace a Latin motto on its stationery with an anti-nuclear slogan. The left-dominated council, which runs the boys' preparatory school in north-central <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, had told the school to stop using stationery bearing a coat of arms and the motto `` Non quo sed quomodo'' _ `` Not whither but in what manner.'' The school was told to use standard-issue council letter paper bearing the slogan `` <ORGANIZATION> Derbyshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> supports nuclear-free zones,'' according to Headmaster <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>.

Later Tuesday, the council's <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bookbinder </PERSON>, said the council would have no objection to the school keeping its motto on the stationery as long as it used the slogan as well.

 Republican presidential candidate <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said Tuesday he will drop his libel suit against former Rep. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> rather than go to trial on Super Tuesday, the biggest day of the primary season. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who was accused of avoiding combat duty in the Korean War through his father's influence, said he wants to take the case to voluntary arbitration in an effort to clear his and his father's names But he said if <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> refuses to do that he will drop the suit anyway. <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehner </PERSON>, said a proposal to use arbitration was rejected by <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s lawyers nine months ago, and he said to propose it on the eve of trial `` is a little disingenuous'' and `` a red herring.'' <PERSON> Lehner </PERSON> has said repeatedly that <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> will not agree to settlement in the case unless <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> pays legal fees _ estimated at $ 400,000 _ piled up by the former congressmen. `` We are prepared to go to trial,'' <PERSON> Lehner </PERSON> said after learning of <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s announcement. `` If he wants to drop the suit,'' the lawyer said, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> must `` pay the legal fees'' amassed by <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> to defend the case. <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> said it's `` not for him -LRB- <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> -RRB- to decide'' to drop the suit, saying he would oppose any motion by <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> to dismiss the case. `` I would rather go to trial. He's called me a liar all over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` I would much prefer there be a verdict as to which of us has told the truth.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s $ 35 million suit accuses <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> of defaming him in a widely publicized letter contending the former television evangelist had used the influence of his father, the late Sen. <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, to avoid combat duty in the Korean War as a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> officer. The case had been scheduled for next Tuesday, the same date as <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> primaries and caucuses in 17 states, including <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was campaigning. `` In order to compete in that trial I would have to break off my campaign today and run the risk of losing <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and other parts of the South,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said at an airport news conference. `` That was an impossible decision for me to make and an unfair one.'' He has proposed that the issue be resolved by the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Libel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> run jointly by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arbitration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said if <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> refuses arbitration he would take pre-trial evidence and testimony already collected to an unspecified panel of experts and have them give a public opinion on <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>'s contentions. `` If he does n't -LRB- go to arbitration -RRB-, we will prove to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people that he truly does n't want the truth to come out,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. At another news conference later in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> complained about the judge's actions, saying: `` She has done everything she can to get us to drop the case. I have done everything I could to make a settlement based on the truth.'' In his letter, <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> wrote that he and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had been on the same Korea-bound troop ship in 1951 but that <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was taken off the vessel in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> where he was given a non-combat post after telling other Marines his father would arrange a transfer. <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> also wrote that when <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> later was sent to <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> he was known as the `` division liquor officer'' because he made frequent trips to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> has denied that his father used any influence to get him off the troop ship. While campaigning in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Monday, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> called <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> a `` pathological liar'' and charged that he circulated the <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> story in an effort to hurt <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s political campaign.

<TEXT>
 More than 500 military police troopers fought about 2,500 striking coal miners in southern <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> on Tuesday and dozens of people were injured, according to a union lawyer and a state senator. The melee took place in <LOCATION> Criciuma </LOCATION>, a town in southern <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Catarina </LOCATION> state, 800 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>. The union lawyer, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gava </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone from the region, `` Many miners from other companies and townspeople joined in the protest, which turned the city center into a war zone. By the end, there were more than 5,000 people throwing rocks and objects.'' <PERSON> Gava </PERSON> said at least 30 police and miners were injured and one miner was arrested. The chief of local police, <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzaga </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, reported that five people were held for a few hours, then were let go. The chief put the number of injured _ police, miners and others caught up in the turmoil _ at 20. However, State Sen. <PERSON> Itamar </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, who was at the site of the brawl, said that 33 military police and 33 miners were hurt. Authorities said the troopers were under orders not to attack the strikers, but retaliated when they themselves came under attack. <PERSON> Gava </PERSON> said the trouble began when police tried to remove striking mine workers who were demonstrating peacefully in front of a branch of the government-run bank, <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> do <LOCATION> Brasil </LOCATION>. `` The downtown square was almost completely destroyed,'' <PERSON> Gava </PERSON> reported. `` Miners pulled down walls to break up the bricks for ammunition against police and stoned houses and office buildings in the immediate area.'' TV Globo, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s largest private network, showed a burning motorbike in the square and military police with truncheons and behind big shields rushing at miners. Troopers threw tear gas and exploded concussion bombs to disperse the mob. <PERSON> Gava </PERSON> said the miners had been striking for 21 days to force <ORGANIZATION> Carbonifera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prospera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to adhere to a Jan. 1 agreement for a 145 percent pay raise to make up for losses to 17 percent monthly inflation. Pay scales were not immediately available. The company, along with five others in <LOCATION> Criciuma </LOCATION>, signed the accord, but while the others paid up, <PERSON> Prospera </PERSON> went back on the deal after the company was sold to the government-run <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gava </PERSON> said. Company representatives said over <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globo </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Prospera </PERSON>'s responsibility to adhere to the agreement ended with the sale of the company <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globo </ORGANIZATION> said the company had agreed to meet with union representatives Wednesday. <PERSON> Da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, a Social Democrat, called the attack on the strikers `` unmotivated'' and said the state <ORGANIZATION> senate </ORGANIZATION> would investigate the fray.

 A 77-year-old man who told authorities he shot and killed his ailing wife in a nursing home so she would n't have to `` go through any more pain'' was charged Tuesday with first - and second-degree murder <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Evansville </LOCATION> is accused of killing <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, 71, who suffered from advanced Alzheimer's disease. Mrs. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, who was a cleaning woman in a doctor's office before being stricken with Alzheimer's, was shot four times with a .22 - caliber pistol Monday at <ORGANIZATION> Crestview </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nursing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Evansville </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, a former farmer and bus driver, was arrested without incident at the nursing home and was being held in the county jail in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, the sheriff said.

Judge <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> set bond at $ 100,000 Tuesday and scheduled a second hearing Monday to determine when <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> could be released, <PERSON> Eilers </PERSON> said. `` We're planning on convening a grand jury relatively soon,'' <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrott </PERSON> said Tuesday. Mrs. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> had been a patient at the home periodically and was to undergo surgery Monday for a broken hip she suffered Sunday in a fall, <PERSON> Eilers </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> told nursing home administrators he wanted to visit his wife before she was taken to the hospital and he went to her room, <PERSON> Eilers </PERSON> said. Police were called when shots were heard, and authorities found <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> slumped over the victim's body, <PERSON> Eilers </PERSON> said. `` He said he realized what he was doing and he would have to come with us,'' <PERSON> Eilers </PERSON> said. `` He stated to us he planned this because he did not want her to suffer any more. He said he did n't want her to go through any more pain. Asked if <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> had indicated whether he had discussed the action with his wife, <PERSON> Eilers </PERSON> said: `` His wife was unable to discuss anything with anybody.'' He said she was in very advanced stages of Alzheimer's, a degenerative disease of the central nervous system characterized especially by premature senility. The first-degree murder charge alleges that the killing was premeditated, while state law defines second-degree murder as a spontaneous killing.

 Four Libyan warplanes landed Tuesday at an airfield beside a <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> oasis and their crew members asked for political asylum in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, the government's <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. A source at <ORGANIZATION> Cairo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity under security regulations, said the two-seater, Soviet-made MiG-23s landed at the military base in <LOCATION> Siwa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oasis </LOCATION>, 385 miles west of <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> and 30 miles east of the Libyan border. The source said all the crewmembers requested political asylum, but he did not specify how many there were. Egyptian authorities are considering the asylum requests, the source said.

 Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was told that one of his aides might have committed a felony, tampering with a grand jury witness, the governor's former chief of security testified at <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s impeachment trial Tuesday. As the opening day of testimony closed in the first impeachment trial of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governor in six decades, lawyers were questioning <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> `` Beau'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who once supervised security for the governor's every move. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> has said under oath that he was not told about an alleged death threat by one of his aides against a grand jury witness and was n't aware it might have been a crime. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s testimony came at the end of a day that featured opening statements by both sides, a state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refusal to stop the impeachment trial, and confusion over whether <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> had tried from his suburban `` government in exile'' to contact the trial's first witness during a lunch break. There also was a lower court ruling refusing a move by <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> supporters to block a recall election scheduled for May. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said he went to the governor as soon as he knew about the situation and researched the law to determine that if the allegation was true it was a felony. The governor has claimed that <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> `` mumbled'' when they talked and said nothing about the possibly criminal nature of the situation. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is accused of obstructing justice by thwarting the official investigation of the alleged threat. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> insisted he personally told the governor a felony might have occurred. `` Lieutenant, is there any question in your mind that the governor understood the problem?'' asked prosecutor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON> `` He never asked me to repeat anything,'' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. However, he said he never mentioned the words, `` death threat.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, a state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> officer who testified both Tuesday morning and afternoon, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> he hung up the phone before the governor could talk to him. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, absent from the impeachment trial for a second day, issued a statement denying the story. His spokesman said the governor made a mistake and asked for the wrong officer, asking for `` Frank'' when he meant `` <PERSON> Dave </PERSON>.'' On Tuesday night, <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sgt </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said the incident had been difficult to sort out, but `` we accept that the scenario they -LRB- the governor's office -RRB- are putting out is accurate.'' He said a mistake may have been made in trying to put <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> in touch with <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. In his ruling, the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> denied the request by <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s lawyers in a 4-0 ruling. The governor's lawyers had contended that his constitutional right to a fair trial in criminal court would be jeopardized by allowing the impeachment to proceed now. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s impeachment trial is not a criminal proceeding. Rather, the court said, the impeachment trial is a legislative proceeding solely intended to decide whether to remove a state officer. Friday, the court had denied a request from <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s lawyers that it delay Monday's start of the impeachment trial. The court had said it would consider during its Tuesday conference a request from <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s lawyers for an injunction against the trial. The governor was the subject of both praise and denunications as attorneys delivered opening statements. `` There's something wrong in this state when you can take an elected official and throw the book at him ... on the basis of witnesses who have a stake in his being outsted,'' defense attorney <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Craft </PERSON> said in a loud, feverish statement to state senators who are sitting as judge and jury. `` What the facts are going to demonstrate is you had a mutiny,'' said <PERSON> Craft </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s former lobbyist in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Several of the officials involved in allegations against <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, he noted, were in office before <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was inaugurated in January 1987. The attorney, warning of personal attacks to come on <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> associates, said he might be forced to `` take our dirty laundry out and lay it before the world.'' It has been reported that Craft will attack the credibility of Director of Public Safety <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>, one of the key witnesses against <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, by alleging <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> had sexual affairs with members of his staff. <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> issued a short statement Tuesday afternoon saying the sexual allegations are `` a ridiculous bunch of lies and intolerable.'' Craft's emotional opening followed a quieter presentation by prosecutor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON>, who said he would prove the governor broke the law when he allegedly ordered <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> to resist cooperating with an investigation of an alleged death threat by a <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> aide. `` The governor's conduct surrounding this threat was positively wrong, without lawful authority. He violated his oath of office and obstructed justice,'' said <LOCATION> French </LOCATION>. French, who is serving as a prosecutor for the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, warned senators that the defense would try to divert their attention from the governor and to `` prosecute'' others. He implored them: `` Do n't be distracted. Keep your eye on the ball.'' With <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> again absent from the proceedings which could end his political career, testimony began on the first of three charges against him _ the obstruction of justice allegation. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, a Republican, also is accused of improperly concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan and misusing $ 80,000 from the governor's protocol fund by loaning it to his car dealership The opening statements Tuesday only dealt with the alleged threat because the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> agreed to consider one section of the articles of impeachment at a time. In his testinomy, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> offered a rough outline of the events behind the obstruction of justice claim. The 28 senators present Tuesday in the contemporary, reddih wood-paneled <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chamber listened intently as <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> spoke from the witness stand elevated at the front of the semi-circular room. Seated next to the witness stand was <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, chief justice of the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, who is serving as referee in the proceeding. Four clerks sat below <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>. Several senators, seated at individual desks, took notes on yellow legal pads. The gallery was only partly filled with spectators and reporters, including former <ORGANIZATION> Nixon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrlichman </PERSON>, who went to prison in the Watergate scandal and is covering the impeachment proceeding for <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> magazine. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who was assigned to <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s security detail, said he was on duty last Nov. 13 when <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> administration official <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> came to the detail's office appearing `` nervous, excited and in need to speak to someone.'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> spilled out details of a parking lot confrontation with <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, a senior aide of the governor, in which <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> allegedly threatened the life of another <LOCATION> Mecham </LOCATION> assistant, <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, who was believed to be testifying before a grand jury investigating the loan. He said Mrs. <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> told of being confronted by <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> who said: `` Your friend's been a naughty girl.'' `` Mr. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> then went on to say if she -LRB- Ms. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> -RRB- kept acting as she did she could take a long boat ride,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said, quoting Mrs. <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>. The officer said he reported the matter to his superior, Lt. <PERSON> Beau </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who consulted others. Eventually, it was reported to the attorney general's office, he said. The end result, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said, was a meeting with <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> two days later in which <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was removed from command of the governor's security detail. `` What did Mr. <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> say?'' asked prosecutor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckstein </PERSON>. `` That he had advised the governor what took place,'' said <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. `` ... The governor was very upset and angry. He asked for Lt. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> to be transferred. He said he did n't want to have him cooperating with the attorney general and it would cost Lt. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> his job.'' Asked why he reported Mrs. <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>'s comments in the first place, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said: `` In my opinion, the commission of a crime had taken place.'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> also faces a May 17 recall election and a March 22 trial on felony charges accusing him of concealing the loan. The recall passed another hurdle Tuesday when <ORGANIZATION> Maricopa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Martone </PERSON> ruled that a pro-Mecham group, <ORGANIZATION> Concerned </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voters </ORGANIZATION>, had n't produced evidence of widespread fraud in the petition signatures that put the recall on the ballot. `` Plaintiffs have failed to show ... that the consequence of fraud would be to invalidate enough signatures as to fall below the constitutional threshold'' for signatures necessary to force a recall, <PERSON> Martone </PERSON> said. The recall backers had turned in about 80,000 more petition signatures than the minimum needed for a recall vote. Concerned <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voters </ORGANIZATION> had contended in its suit that the election should be stopped and a `` special master'' be appointed to investigate possible fraud.

 <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Assemblies of God church leaders have rejected a request by national church officials that they reconsider their sanction against television evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, a church official confirmed Tuesday.

The Rev. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, general treasurer, said he had no comment and other officials were not at home Tuesday night. Calls to the home of spokeswoman <PERSON> Juleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON> were met by busy signals. The <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Presbytery </LOCATION>'s original sanction was a two-year rehabilitation program that also included counseling for <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, who heads a ministry which reportedly has an annual income of $ 150 million. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> stepped down from the pulpit Feb. 21, telling the congregation at his <ORGANIZATION> Baton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> worship center in a tearful confession that he had sinned against his family and God. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> reportedly paid a prostitute to pose naked for him and then tried to make a deal with a minister who confronted him about it. The latest development in the scandal surfaced in a story by <ORGANIZATION> KATC-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. The station said it had also learned that the national presbytery had recommended barring <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> from the pulpit and television for a year, with an additional year of regulation of his ministry afterwards. A <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Assemblies of God official contacted by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday night confirmed that the state panel had sent its previous sanction back to the national council. The official talked only under conditions he not be identified. When asked if <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> officials had sent back their original censure to the church's national leaders, the source said, `` It would be correct to say that.'' <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Janway </PERSON>, the Assemblies of God district superintendent for <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, said when the state panel met Monday that there would be no announcement of its decision. `` Decisions made by the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> district presbytery today will be returned to the executive presbytery. There will be no further announcement or comment from the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> district council,'' <PERSON> Janway </PERSON> said. There was no indication whether <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> attended that meeting, which lasted from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. The Rev. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Rentz </PERSON>, who is substituting for <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, attended the meeting. <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, secretary-treasurer of the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> district council, acknowledged Monday that national Assemblies of God representatives were at the <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> meeting.

 A federal judge ruled Tuesday that two companies who used young people in a church job-training program had violated child-labor laws and ordered stiff penalties for seven people who ran the program. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> threatened to fine the seven $ 21,000 a day if they continued to use the children, as young as 9 years old. He wrote that the children were `` manifestly being exploited.'' <ORGANIZATION> Shiloh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> True </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> members acknowledged during the January trial that their children worked at construction sites and in shops where they carried bricks, laid foundations and more recently, operated forklifts and power saws. They said they had been doing so for at least 100 years. <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> ordered <ORGANIZATION> McGee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> to pay $ 98,225 in back wages plus nearly $ 36,000 in interest. <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> <PERSON> Brothers </PERSON> and co-defendant <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Woodworking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Mint </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> also were ordered to pay nearly $ 70,000 in court costs. Spokesmen for the companies were not immediately available for comment. There was no answer at the company offices, and their lawyers were not in their offices. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> said they had not received a copy of the decision and could not comment on whether the $ 21,000-per-day fine was retroactive to Oct. 5, when <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> issued an order to stop using the children. `` The minors are clearly dependent on the defendants' business for their employment and are the class of person whom the act is designed to protect,'' <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> wrote in a 58-page opinion. `` They are manifestly being exploited by defendants in this case, whether or not they proclaim their purpose to be in furtherance of their religious beliefs,'' <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> wrote. When the owners of the companies, both church members, continued the program for the church after <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>'s October order, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> asked they be found in contempt of the injunction and be fined $ 20,000 a day. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON>'s would be fined $ 5,000 per day and its two owners, <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> and <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, be fined $ 500 each per day thay they remained in contempt of his order. The judge ordered <ORGANIZATION> McGee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> to pay $ 10,000 per day and order five brothers who owned the company to pay $ 1,000 each per day that they remained in contempt of the order.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> appeared ready on Tuesday night to resume his diplomatic shuttle in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> after reporting to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> told <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> at a three-hour meeting in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> earlier Tuesday that he was interested in <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s effort to set up <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> negotiations. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> did not directly endorse the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> initiative, but told <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> he appreciated the effort being made to open talks. `` It was a serious discussion, covering the whole waterfront,'' the official said. `` Nobody is saying yes or no.'' A statement issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Jordanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> reiterated <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s position that an international peace conference should be attended by the five permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> _ and `` all parties to the conflict, including the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> arranged to confer with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> briefly Tuesday night and more fully on Wednesday before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> begins his talks in the Belgian capital with 15 other allied leaders attending a <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> summit. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> would return to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> at the conclusion of the summit Thursday night and try over the next two days to get acceptance of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> formula for negotiations to deal with both Palestinian unrest in areas under Israeli control and an overall Arab-Israeli settlement. `` He's a key, in my opinion,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> before their meeting at the king's residence in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kensington </LOCATION> district. `` He has immense standing and is a person who has been here a long time.'' Talking to reporters on the way to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> acknowledged he made little progress in four days of shuttle diplomacy. He said he could detect a narrowing of differences, but `` I do n't know if I could describe them in any way that would be perceptible to anyone else.'' Yet, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, `` assuming everyone continues the attitude they have to keep working, to keep working, we'll do it.'' President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, however, in his first comment on his talks with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, said Tuesday he had reservations about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan and he would disclose them only after a final formula was reached. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> conferred in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> Sunday. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> spoke to reporters while visiting neighboring <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> carried his statements from <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> Monday, reporters were told that <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> was not putting pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to form a mixed negotiating delegation for peace talks with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Instead, it was reported, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> had taken the position the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was the sole representative of the 1.5 million Palestinian Arabs who live on the Israel-held <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, where clashes have killed more than 70 Arabs. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal calls for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and Palestinians to open negotiations about April 1 on self-rule for the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> in Israeli-held territory. Talks on an overall <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> settlement would begin by December. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> met twice with Jordanian officials, but he had to seek an authoritative answer from <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for dental treatment. Diplomatic sources in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> he would return to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> after the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit if <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> gave at least qualified support to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal. On his flight to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> stressed a need for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to step up contacts with Palestinians. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> confirmed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had persuaded <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to relax restrictions in permitting two Palestinians, <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> editor, and <PERSON> Fayez </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahme </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> lawyer, to go to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to meet with him five weeks ago. `` We have communicated with them in some important, substantive ways,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> approaches to the Palestinians. He said he had got the Palestinians' reaction indirectly while in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. `` It is n't as though there's no feedback, `` <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` There is feedback. It's not a substitute for directly sitting down with people, and that in a sense is what we've been calling for all along. In the end we've got to sit down together, so we have made a major effort to communicate with them.'' A group of 15 Palestinians invited to meet with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> Friday did not show up under <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> orders. He was similarly snubbed in October on a trip to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.

 The government's chief economic forecasting gauge is flashing warning signs of an economic slowdown this year, but most economists believe the country will be able to escape without a recession.

This weak growth will be followed by an improving economic performance for the rest of 1988 as strength in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports offsets lackluster consumer spending, many economists believe.

<HEAD>Acting With Hepburn Like Playing Baseball with Babe Ruth</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Actress <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> says she has n't quite found the words to describe what it was like to work with screen legend <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> movie `` <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON> Slept Here,'' but she gives it a shot. `` I was intimidated, I was exhilarated, I was overwhelmed, I was inspired, all those things. I do n't know, it's like a kid getting to play baseball with <PERSON> Babe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON>,'' said <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>. The made-for-TV movie airs Monday. `` She has a great sense of humor about herself. She has no reverence about herself as an icon. The fact that other people regard her so highly is, I think, a source of benign amusement for her.'' <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, who starred in the first season of `` Night Court'' and later had a recurring role on `` St. Elsewhere,'' plays Melody Gomphers, a suburban housewife whose life is turned upside-down when a publisher bets a fabulously wealthy novelist that she ca n't stand to live with a typical American family for a week `` It's a gentle comedy,'' <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> says. `` You can imagine her descending on <LOCATION> suburbia </LOCATION> in full sail, with chauffeur and luggage. It's a great part for her, and she's costumed wonderfully, hats and Tibetan jewelry and exotic clothes. I kept my hair in a braid, little housedress. It was kind of fun finding a character that was realistic, but also would contrast well with her. That was my aim, really, was to be a backdrop as much as anything for her, a springboard.'' <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON>, a famous, relentlessly spunky author whose publisher -LRB- <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> -RRB- says she should give up writing because she's lost touch with the common people. He bets her she ca n't stand to stay for a week with the Gompherses and their three children in their little tract house in <LOCATION> Hicksville </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. It's a cute movie. <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON> expects to find a little gingham world, not a soap-opera plot with a philandering husband, crabby kids and a rebellious teen-ager on the road to juvenile delinquency. For their part, the Gompherses are awe-struck when their famous guest arrives, cowing them to the point that they sit silently in the living room, terrified to turn on the television or make any noise that would disturb her. `` Is this what you do in the evening,'' <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON> asks innocently when she emerges to find them all lined up on the sofa, `` sit in silent meditation?'' <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomphers </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schuyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, who is <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON>'s grand-niece in real life, plays the Gomphers' teen-age daughter. <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> plays their prepubescent son, and twins <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Comber </PERSON> play 17-month-old <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON>. `` Katharine's grand-niece -LRB- Grant -RRB- and I used to sit around,'' said <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, `` and I would try to explain to her, because to her it's just <PERSON> Aunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Katie </PERSON>, but I would try and explain to her what it was like for me to work with her aunt.'' In real life, <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> did descend on <LOCATION> suburbia </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> where the movie was shot last year. `` The neighbors actually would go away when we asked them to,'' <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> says with wonder. `` They'd be crowding over the fence taking pictures, and she'd say, ` Go away, now. Go away, do n't do that.' And they would actually leave. They were so polite and respectful. You can imagine what they would do in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>?'' <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said, `` knows what quality is, and it's great to be around someone whose standards will not be compromised, and who has the clout to just say, ` Well, we ca n't do it this way,' and everybody says, ` Well, we ca n't, I guess we ca n't.' And then it gets done right. It's great.''

 This is a deal you might want to consider, and one that you might want to reconsider after learning the facts. This is the deal: Under Section 7623, the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> can pay tipsters who provide information that leads to detection and punishment of tax violators. You know your neighbor is cheating; you consider turning him in. `` Why not?'' you ask yourself. `` I have to pay, and most of the people I know have to pay. And what my neighbor does n't pay means higher payments for honest taxpayers.'' Besides, you might add, the extra money can help in paying what you owe. On investigating further, you learn that 7,853 claims for rewards were filed in 1986, and that Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> recovered $ 258,372,880 in taxes as a result of the program. That's big money; you'd like a share of it. Spurred by the possibility, you continue your research. You learn that if you provide specific and responsible information that prompts an investigation and aids the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> in determining the amount of taxes due, you are entitled to 10 percent of the first $ 75,000 recovered. You may be entitled to 5 percent of the first $ 75,000 if your information leads to the recovery of taxes but is considered of value only in determining the amount due, rather than being the cause of the investigation. And you learn, finally, that if your tip brings about an investigation but is of no value in determining the tax due, you may be eligible for 1 percent of the first $ 75,000. The rewards do n't end with the first $ 75,000, but the percentages change. However, your information must be, as the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> states, `` specific and responsible.'' And the dollar basis for the reward is computed only on the amount of tax collected that would n't otherwise be collected. Fair enough. But as you dig into the details you may begin to have doubts. You learn that of the 7,853 claims filed in 1986, only 820 resulted in payoffs to tipsters. And on average they did n't get very much. The total of all rewards was $ 1,307,000, meaning an average payout of $ 1,600. In other words and numbers, the percentage of reward to taxes collected came to less than one-half of 1 percent, a decidedly small finder's fee. `` The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> is the real winner in the tipster program,'' says <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON>, speaking for associates <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Graves </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivers </PERSON>, who researched this data for clients of their newsletter, `` On The Money.'' The three men are n't just editors. All are authorities on financial matters _ <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> on investments and tax shelters, Graves on insurance, <PERSON> Ivers </PERSON> on taxes and financial planning _ and all are professors at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bryn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mawr </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>. It might be added that <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> is where many of the nation's financial advisers, such as <ORGANIZATION> Chartered </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Underwriters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chartered </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consultants </ORGANIZATION>, are trained. It is from that vantage point that they declare the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> rather than the taxpayer to be the real winner. They observe that while the total collected in 1986 was more than 20 times the amount obtained in 1982, the percentage of reward to taxes collected was the lowest. One more item: The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> classifies the rewards as taxable income.

<HEAD>Among Presidential Candidates, Robertson Toughest on Tobacco</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: This is another in an occasional series of stories examining
the presidential candidates' stands on major issues in Campaign '88</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, a reformed pack-and-a-half-a-day smoker, is taking the toughest stand against tobacco among the 10 presidential candidates. Most of his rivals, campaigning in the tobacco belt in advance of Super Tuesday, support the government's tobacco price support program. In response to a survey by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, nearly all the candidates said they would maintain or intensify efforts to discourage people from smoking. Seven of 10 said they back the government's price support program. But <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> wants to snuff out the tobacco industry entirely over 10 years and stiffen taxes on cigarettes to help pay for long-term health care for the elderly. The AP surveyed the candidates about tobacco and smoking as they gird for the March 8 round of primaries across the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, where tobacco may no longer be king but remains the top cash crop. Tobacco provides wages and benefits of more than $ 14 billion a year for 710,000 people across the region. With the exception of <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Democrats </PERSON> <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, the candidates favor continuing the price support program for tobacco, which guarantees growers a minimum price and regulates how much they can produce. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I support the law requiring the tobacco program to be run at no net cost to the federal government.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not reply to a separate question about whether he would expand government anti-smoking efforts. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> raised eyebrows at a Democrats' debate in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> in January when he brought up the death toll caused by smoking and said that despite the 100,000 tobacco farmers in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, `` I do n't think there should be any public subsidy of tobacco at all.'' But in subsequent campaign appearances in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and again in response to the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> survey, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> made clear that he is no critic of the tobacco price support program, which he said `` does not rely at all on taxpayers' dollars ... -LRB- and -RRB- helps many small tobacco farmers stay in business.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> added, `` I believe the government should do everything in its power to educate the public about the hazards associated with smoking.'' He said he supports stronger warning labels on cigarette packages. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, himself, quit growing tobacco on a family farm after his sister <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> died of lung cancer in 1984. Democrat <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> strongly defended the price support program, although he favors shifting more of its benefits to small, family farms. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> added: `` We have to recognize that 350,000 deaths per year are related to smoking. The government must beef-up educational efforts to inform the public of this hazard.'' He said the government should consider using revenues from the 16-cent excise tax on cigarettes to assist tobacco farmers who want to switch to other crops. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he supports tobacco price supports, as well as `` a vigorous public health campaign to encourage smokers to quit and to discourage young people from taking up the habit.'' Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., said he supports the current federal tobacco program, as well as a ban on smoking on short commercial flights and `` an active public education campaign'' against smoking Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., who is not campaigning in the Super Tuesday states, favors doubling the excise tax on cigarettes Of price supports, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said: `` The tobacco industry is very clear about getting the message across that the current tobacco program does not cost the taxpayers. While that may be true ... the fact is that smoking costs all of us greatly. I believe we must expand government efforts to discourage people from smoking.'' Senate Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> said it is unlikely that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would ever outlaw smoking. If it eliminated domestic tobacco production, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> smokers would just be forced to use `` lower quality, imported'' tobacco with `` no real gains in public health,'' he said. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said smoking-related deaths cost the nation at least $ 65 billion a year. He called for earmarking revenues from a users' fee on tobacco `` exclusively for meeting the long-term health care needs of our older citizens. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> has called for a government buyout of farmers' tobacco allotments over 10 years and tax breaks to allow tobacco companies to phase out their investments. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> asked all the presidential candidates on Feb. 11: `` Do you support the current federal price support program for tobacco? Would you expand government efforts to discourage people from smoking?'' All replied in writing except <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, whose positions were outlined by a campaign aide. Here are the Republicans' replies:

 `` One of the most misunderstood aspects of tobacco is the government price support program, sometimes called ` the tobacco subsidy.' ... The <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>, which administers commodity stabilization programs for <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, has in the past incurred minor expenses in the tobacco program _ only $ 58 million over a period of 50 years prior to 1984. Meanwhile, federal, state, and local excise taxes collected from the sale of tobacco products have exceeded $ 150 billion. `` I have supported efforts to increase public awareness of the potential dangers of smoking. It seems unlikely that smoking will be outlawed in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and tobacco imports will undoubtedly continue, regardless of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production. In other words, if the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> eliminated tobacco production, those <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens choosing to smoke would do so using lower quality, imported foreign tobacco instead of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> produced tobacco.''

 `` Smoking-related deaths are costing the nation at least $ 65 billion each year ... one-third on direct health care costs, while the remaining two-thirds _ a whopping $ 43 billion _ is attributable to lost job productivity. Ultimately, these staggering costs are borne by the average citizen _ and nearly 75 percent of Americans do n't even smoke. `` It makes no sense that while the Surgeon General's office is waging a campaign against smoking, the federal government is involved in price supports for tobacco. And it's illogical for politicians to bemoan the grave health consequences of tobacco while, at the same time, supporting its production. `` I believe the federal government should get out of tobacco production, and continue its campaign to educate the public on the dangers of smoking ... A user fee on tobacco products would serve as an added incentive to stop smoking. Revenues from such a fee should be earmarked exclusively for meeting the long-term health care needs of our older citizens.'' Here are the Democrats' replies:

 `` In <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, I have supported policies to protect the rights of non-smokers. And as president, I would support a vigorous public health campaign to encourage smokers to quit and to incourage young people from taking up the habit. `` I do not favor direct taxpayer subsidies to farmers who grow tobacco. However, I do not oppose the tobacco industry's own effort to provide economic assistance through the existing <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> loan program, which operates at no net cost to the taxpayer.

 `` I do support the current federal program. There are a lot of small - and medium-sized farmers who depend on that program to give them a fair price When properly run, this program does not cost the government any money: it's paid for by the people who smoke cigarettes. `` I support measures to ban smoking on commercial airlines on short flights and to restrict smoking to certain areas on longer flights. Also, although I do not favor a total ban on advertising and promotion of tobacco products, I do support an active public education campaign to inform people of the potential adverse effects that tobacco products can have on our health.''

 `` I support the current federal program for tobacco which is funded entirely by the contributions of growers and processors and does not rely at all on taxpayers' dollars.

I have been a strong supporter of stronger warning labels on cigarette packages and other mechanisms to inform the public of smoking-related health risks. I believe public education will result in a gradually decreasing demand for tobacco products.

 Campaign aide <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Angoff </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> does not support price supports because `` it makes no sense on the one hand to pay people to grow tobacco and then for us as a society to incur the tremendous costs that tobacco imposes.''

 `` In general I support the federal tobacco program although.. I would like to see the tobacco program reformed so that small family farms benefit more than they currently do. At the present time production quotas are distributed in a way that favors corporate farmers and neglects the family farmer who is the backbone of the rural <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. ... `` As long as there is a demand for tobacco and people who make their livelihood from meeting that demand, the federal government should offer its assistance. `` But we have to recognize that 350,000 deaths per year are related to smoking. The government must beef-up educational efforts to inform the public of this hazard. Just as importantly, we must make every effort possible to assist farmers to diversify out of tobacco production if they so desire. We should consider using some portion of the 16 cent tobacco excise tax to fund such an effort.''

 `` The tobacco industry is very clear about getting the message across that the current tobacco program does not cost the taxpayers. While that may be true of the program that assists tobacco farmers, the fact is that smoking costs all of us greatly. `` I believe we must expand government efforts to discourage people from smoking. ... I believe we must begin to take steps to protect non-smokers from the adverse effects of smoking. I generally support legislative efforts to discourage smoking. I am co-sponsor of legislation that would double the federal excise tax on tobacco products. ... `` This would have the effect of pricing tobacco products out of the reach of those most susceptible to developing a long-term smoking habit: teen-agers.''

<BYLINE>Swaggart Oddly Began Belittling Himself Before His Fall^

<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the month before TV evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> was silenced by scandal, his preaching turned from outward attacks to self-criticism in what `` may have been the outgrowth of his own sin,'' a researcher says. `` He lately started putting himself down,'' says <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Winzenburg </PERSON>, a communications professor at <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. `` It makes you wonder how much of it was guilt seeping through. `` He usually had put others down and pumped himself up as being greater than anyone else, with an inside, direct line to God. But then all of a sudden, he started saying these negative, deprecating things about himself. He seemed to be pointing a finger at himself, and preaching it to others.'' Leaders of the Assemblies of God in <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> district initially recommended that he be suspended from preaching for at least three months because of his reported involvement with a prostitute. National leaders of the church have asked the district to review that recommendation, and perhaps make the penalty more severe. <PERSON> Winzenburg </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> whose monitoring project mainly aimed at timing and comparing fund-raising pitches of TV evangelists, said he was puzzled when <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> began switching his preaching targets. `` It was something that had n't been there before, but now it makes more sense,'' he said in a telephone interview. `` It may have been the outgrowth of his own sin. `` He also started picking on fellow Pentecostals. Before, he had focused more on attacking Catholics and mainline Protestants. But now he was denouncing his own kind.'' From <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s preaching since mid-1987, some of it taped and broadcast after his Feb. 21 confession to his congregation of `` grievous sin,'' <PERSON> Winzenburg </PERSON> cites these samples of <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s self-deprecation: July l2 _ `` I'm scared to death of money and scared to death of women Those two things have caused more creatures' downfall than any other.'' Dec. 14 _ `` I'm a poor, pitiful, flawed creature.'' Dec. 20 _ Taking an odd subject for a Christmas sermon, he identified himself with <PERSON> Judas </PERSON>, who betrayed Christ. Feb. 21 _ Comparing himself to the biblical harlot, <PERSON> Rahab </PERSON>, he said he was a `` poor, pitiful, scarred, flawed piece of humanity.'' Samples given of his put-down of other Pentecostals: Feb. 24 _ Attacking higher education, he said, `` Even Pentecostal schools are straying.'' Feb. 25 _ `` Holy Ghost preachers are falling for seducing spirits at an alarming rate. This is the paramount danger of the church ... In supposedly Holy Ghost -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Pentecostal </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- churches, the pastors never preach on the Holy Spirit.'' July 24 _ He said that after criticizing the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, `` all hell broke loose,'' but he had `` a right to criticize others because the book -LRB- Bible -RRB- gives us the right. `` If Catholics go wrong, somebody's got to let them know. If Baptists go wrong, somebody's got to let them know. Even if Pentecostals go wrong, somebody's got to let them know. That's what we'll continue to do.'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> lodged complaints of sexual misconduct that led to the ouster of former TV evangelist <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and that also bumped a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> evangelist, <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>. Both were ministers of the Assemblies of God. <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> reportedly provided evidence that unseated <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> _ pictures of him at a motel with a prostitute. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> also has harshly assailed other denominations, declaring Dec. 13 that `` in most churches in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, you could n't get saved if you wanted to. Some of his sharpest assaults on Roman Catholicism seem to have been toned down lately, <PERSON> Winzenburg </PERSON> said. Some TV stations had threatened to drop his program if the attacks continued. The <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Interchurch Conference, including most major <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bodies in the state of <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s headquarters, in 1983 formally protested his attacks on Catholicism The Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stovall </PERSON>, the conference executive director, says `` we took it pretty lightly'' when <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> denounced Baptists, Methodists and other Protestants, but when he began stirring up anti-Catholic venom, `` We had to condemn it.'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> has called Catholicism a `` false cult,'' a `` monstrosity of heresy'' and a `` complete contradiction of the word of God.'' Roman Catholic Bishop <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ott </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, met with <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> in 1984 to urge him to stop the attacks, but said afterward <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> continued to `` harbor judgments and make statements'' about the church that were neither true nor fair.

<HEAD>Paris' Ritz Opens Cooking School and Cordon Bleu Goes Hi-Tech</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Two French-cooking schools _ one the oldest, the other the newest _ are giving the world's gastronomic capital yet another culinary lift. Cordon Bleu, the oldest and most prestigious, has taken on a high-tech image at a new location in a five-story building that once was an infirmary. The luxurious Ritz Hotel, the newest, is opening its kitchens April 5 to students of haute cuisine. The cachet of the elegant <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> hotel is maintained in the decor of its new basement cooking school, where gleaming white-tiled spaces and hand-painted murals set the tone. The Cordon Bleu, long situated in cramped quarters in the classy Champ de Mars district under the Eiffel Tower, moved in January to the building on an anonymous corner of the 15th arrondissement in southern <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. The school where servants from affluent families long ago watched cooking demonstrations in an amphitheater now offers every high-tech amenity, including video screens. Both schools offer all levels of instruction up to professional. Despite the new home, tradition at the venerable Cordon Bleu remains intact. The top diploma at the Cordon Bleu is awarded to students who pass a nine-month session. The Ritz school's top diploma follows a 12-week course. Hardly a newcomer to fine food, the Ritz has been known for its cuisine since <PERSON> Auguste </PERSON> <PERSON> Escoffier </PERSON> attracted international gastronomes early in the century. It decided to spread its know-how as part of an overall renovation plan started by <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Fayed </PERSON>, the Egyptian entrepreneur who bought the hotel nine years ago. `` We feel we're offering unique and superior instruction for a private cooking school,'' said <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Usher </PERSON>, an American who left the <ORGANIZATION> Cordon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bleu </ORGANIZATION> to take over the Ritz school's administration. `` Our chefs are tops.'' The courses are to be supervised by three of the <ORGANIZATION> Ritz </ORGANIZATION>'s own chefs, all winners of the top professional award, <PERSON> Meilleur </PERSON> <PERSON> Ouvrier </PERSON> de <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Most daily courses will be handled by two chefs with credentials from prestigious <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> restaurants. One, <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Guillut </PERSON>, perfected his English while working at restaurants like l'Orangerie and <ORGANIZATION> Ma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cuisine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The up-to-date equipment includes permanently cooled pastry marbles, the latest in ovens, freezers and mixers. The hotel's meat smoker will be used for `` charcuterie'' courses, and video outlets are available for taping recipes. Pupils can browse in a reference library, taste wine with the <ORGANIZATION> Ritz </ORGANIZATION>'s sommelier, and the change and shower after the course in a special area. Across the Seine at Cordon Bleu, in the business since 1896, it's a whole new world. Spanking clean in light greys and blues, today's big-scale school includes two demonstration rooms, four huge cooking and pastry rooms, and a beautiful winter garden. Equipment includes convection ovens, pastry-rising ovens and huge dough-kneaders, plus special machines for a new course on vacuum-packing and cooking _ to be taught by <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, the 1987 winner of the French National Cuisine and Pastry trophy. `` We're still emphasizing traditional <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> cuisine,'' said <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cahill </PERSON>, a Cordon Bleu graduate and its spokeswoman. `` But in our expanded facilities just about everything is new.'' `` The basics are still the main point,'' said <PERSON> Chef </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, one of seven chefs. `` The students will still learn how to chop, knead, whip and do everything else by hand as well.'' The overwhelming majority of Cordon Bleu students are from abroad _ about 30 percent <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and 20 percent Japanese, said Ms. <PERSON> Cahill </PERSON>. While the Ritz plans English translations in all courses, the Cordon Bleu still teaches its advanced courses in French. Financing for the modernization comes from the Pages group, headed by <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Cointreau </PERSON>, which bought the school in 1981. Intermediate students at the <ORGANIZATION> Ritz </ORGANIZATION> may choose a one-to-six week course of practical sessions and demonstrations at cost in French francs of about $ 800 a week. The Ritz's highest-level <PERSON> Auguste </PERSON> <PERSON> Escoffier </PERSON> course, a 12-week session, costs about $ 10,000. Cordon Bleu's main three 12-week courses comprise a cycle of `` basic'' through `` superior'' at a cost of about $ 4,200 each. To get the coveted Cordon Bleu Grand Diplome, pupils now spend nine months, reduced from 12, in intensive cooking and pastry courses preparing for the big exam, at a cost of $ 19,000. `` We're also offering new intensive four-day practical and demonstration sessions,'' ranging from charcuterie to regional cuisine and costing about $ 500, said Ms. <PERSON> Cahill </PERSON>. Both schools conduct wine tasting courses. A visitor to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> who wants to compare the big-school ambience of the Cordon Bleu with the tonier <PERSON> Ritz </PERSON> can attend demonstrations at either one for less than $ 35 each.

<HEAD>The New Boy at Commerce Tangles with NASA, Japan and Shakes Things

<TEXT>
 As other upper-echelon administration officials plot a return to private life, retired <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> steel executive <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Verity </PERSON> is relishing his role as `` the new boy on the block.'' Just four months into his job, the new <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> secretary appears determined to leave an activist's stamp on his agency, although he allows `` I have a lot of catching up to do.'' `` There's so much going on, it's hard to get your arms around it,'' he said in an interview. But <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION>, soft-spoken and gracious like predecessor <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldrige </PERSON>, says he considers himself a `` late bloomer'' at 71. His first months in office have been anything but placid. There have been trade tangles with the Japanese, attacks from conservatives over his views on Soviet trade, a run-in with <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, a staff upheaval. And whales. `` I never had any idea I would be in charge of whales some day. And I had no idea it would take so much of my time,'' <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said, referring to his recent recommendation for sanctions on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for their killing of minke whales in violation of international whaling agreements. That action, while mostly symbolic, won plaudits from conservationists. As the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> celebrates the 75th anniversary of its creation on Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> has been pressing ahead with his own schemes to more fully automate the activities of the once staid but now sprawling agency. The department administers <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade policy, probably its most vital role in a day of $ 170 billion trade deficits. But it also collects and analyzes economic data and serves as home for the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> and a host of other agencies. One of <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION>'s first moves was getting behind a program for encouraging the commercialization of space _ a project, he said, which brought him into immediate conflict with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> does n't want anybody else out there,'' he said. And <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> set up a program to help smaller companies `` get into the export game'' by capitalizing on exchange-rate changes that are making <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods more competitive abroad, a project he says is now his top priority. `` It may be that a new boy on the block can help move things along,'' the white-haired former industrialist said in an interview in his sparsely furnished office in the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The office is a huge room built to the specifications of <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>, the commerce secretary from 1921 to 1928, but more recently festooned with the cowboy and rodeo memorabilia that were the pride of <LOCATION> Baldrige </LOCATION>, an immensely popular <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretary among agency employes. <PERSON> Baldrige </PERSON>'s death last summer in a freak rodeo accident brought <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION>, a longtime <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> fundraiser and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> suporter, out of a comfortable retirement in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. He had been chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Armco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION>. But he was not able to win over all former <LOCATION> Baldrige </LOCATION> loyalists. Some of the highest-ranking agency officials have quit since <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> took the helm, the most recent departure coming last week with the resignation of <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Smart </PERSON>, an under commerce secretary well respected on <LOCATION> Capital </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> for his expertise on trade issues. <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> and Smart had a number of personality clashes, according to other department employes who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The friction culminated in <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION>'s withdrawal of his earlier recommendation that Smart be elevated to the No. 2 <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to succeed former Deputy Sectretary <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a rival to <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> in early speculation on whom <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would pick to succeed <PERSON> Baldrige </PERSON>, also resigned his post soon after <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION>'s confirmation. Still, <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION>'s no-nonsense approach, particularly his tough stance toward <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, has won him a lot of fans in the business community. `` It has endeared him to a lot of people around here. Other secretaries and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spokesmen have not been urging the government to start speaking in plain language to these guys,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Muller </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> representative for <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Soon after taking office, <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> went on the offensive, telling a <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> audience that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> faced near-certain retaliation if it continued to restrict its markets while underpricing its own products in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets. `` I understand their culture, I understand that they are a closed society,'' <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said in the interview. `` They're not the least bit interested in opening their society.'' When he was nominated, congressional conservatives balked at <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION>'s long support of closer ties with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as past chairman of a U.S.-Soviet trade advocacy council. And some Jewish groups considered troublesome his public skepticism toward the Jackson-Vanik law, which denies preferential trade treatment to the Soviets because of their refusal to allow free Soviet Jewish emigration. Japanese-Americans rued his use of the term `` Japs'' in a pre-confirmation speech. And environmentalists were unhappy about his industrialist's record on clean air and clean water. However, since he was sworn in last Oct. 19 _ the day the <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> crashed _ <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> has weathered most of these criticisms. But he says that's he's learned one thing: the difference between running a steel company and running a federal agency. `` I think you find out you're not really in charge,'' <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The big difference is the mission of private business is to get something done. In government, this is not so. In government, it's to move toward solving a problem, but to get everybody on board with you as you try to solve it.'' `` And that just requires a lot of time and a lot of massaging of people's feelings.''

<HEAD>Public Quarrel Of Bishops Seen As Eroding Their Joint Influence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s doctrinal umpire was asked at a recent <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> news conference whether current controversy among American bishops might weaken their collective voice, he would n't say However, the question is regarded a potentially more underlying threat to the bishops' joint influence than the surface cause of their present public quarrel _ a statement on AIDS. Cardinal <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratzinger </PERSON>, a powerful dispenser of church discipline, said only that he would n't talk about the matter until he speaks with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bishops about it this spring. He has been critical of organizations of bishops such as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION>, and he left hanging the potential of <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> intervention of some kind. The bishops' unusual out-in-the-open dispute _ over an AIDS statement issued by the bishops' 50-member administrative board in mid-December _ has focused on some content of the statement itself. But several knowledgeable churchmen saw in the conflict a potential erosion of the bishops' collective teaching function via their conference, which has become increasingly vigorous on issues from economics to nuclear weaponry. `` The loser will be the bishops' conference itself,'' writes Monsignor <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Basler </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tablet </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> sociologist <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Loyola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> says the controversy `` plays into the hands of people who question the purpose and effectiveness of the national conference's collegiality. Collegiality, the mutually shared responsibility of bishops and others, was stressed by the reforming <ORGANIZATION> Second </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> of 1962-65, and has been manifested increasingly in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bishops' joint teaching documents <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, author of numerous books on church developments, including his study of the growing scope of the conference, `` Re-Imagining American Catholicism,'' said in an interview: `` If personalities begin to speak outside the conference and indicate that the conference wishes do not match their own, then the harm to the conference could be irreparable.'' Asked if that was happening, he said, `` Exactly.'' He said it `` would please certain people in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> who have long been suspicious and wary of the bishops' conference in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. There are several Curial officials who wish to diminish its influence on a practical level.'' <PERSON> Ratzinger </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s watchful Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, has said there is `` no theological basis'' for national bishops' conferences. He says such organizations risk smothering <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s direct line of authority with individual bishops. That authority plainly can be more readily exercised with lone bishops than with national blocs of them. In any case, those objecting to the AIDS statement have been largely those regarded as among the bishops' conservative wing, tending to be more closely aligned with the conservative <PERSON> Ratzinger </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said he presumed `` good motives'' of those challenging the AIDS statement, but `` the effect is to damage the process of collegiality itself.'' `` Collegiality is the process used to avoid seeming personality conflicts,'' he said. `` Collegiality means everybody is heard, with a focus on the issue, rather than on two or three personalities.'' Individual bishops always are free to dissent from conference conclusions, but a highly inclusive consensus usually is achieved, and any bishops disagreeing simply disregard the recommendations in their dioceses, rather than challenging the process. In the present conflict, several bishops, notably <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s Cardinal <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Law </PERSON>, have publicly assailed the AIDs document Several others, including <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s Cardinal <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernardin </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>'s Archbishop <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON>, have defended it. The document repeatedly insists on the church's teaching of abstinence from sex before marriage and fidelity within marriage as the only sure safeguards against AIDS, saying that without them, there is no such thing as `` safe sex.'' But one paragraph caused the fuss. It says public educational programs, directed at people who may reject church standards, could include information about condoms, which some medical experts say may help prevent AIDS. Critics charged this implied approving condoms, condemned by the church as birth-control devices. Defenders insist the document does not approve condoms, but saw them as a `` lesser evil'' compared to the `` greater evil'' of spreading a deadly disease. The bishops' administrative board meets March 21 to consider the furor, and may put it before the entire conference of bishops in June. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Ratzinger </PERSON> said he would discuss it with bishops in their ad limina -LRB- periodic -RRB- visits to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> beginning in March. The bishops' conference first was formed in 1917 to coordinate church efforts in World War I. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> threatened to supress it in 1922 on grounds it infringed on jurisdiction of individual bishops. The bishops managed to preserve it, insisting it was a voluntary organization, depending on each bishop's free choice to participate, and by their consensus, exercised collective responsibilities and moral suasion. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conference has inspired 42 similar national <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops' conferences around the world, acting to carry out mutual responsibilities.

 There is so little left. A red cardboard valentine with torn paper lace, which proclaims, `` I love you Mom.'' A carefully penned Thanksgiving essay in which the writer says he's grateful for his family `` to have someone to love me.'' A child's `` Life Story'' book with extra pages left blank for future adventures. <PERSON> Chad </PERSON> <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Gragg </PERSON>, 12, <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gragg </PERSON>, 11, and <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gragg </PERSON>, 8, died together at dusk on the cold afternoon of Feb. 4. It was <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON>'s 11th birthday. Despite admonishments from a teacher and a chum who rode home with him on the bus, he chose to celebrate it by sliding on the frozen surface of a farmer's pond. The ice broke. <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> fell into the frigid water. His big brother <PERSON> Chad </PERSON>, doing what his parents had always taught him to do, attempted to save him. He, too, fell in. <PERSON> Stevie </PERSON>, strong for his age, also tried to be his brothers' keeper. His body plunged through the thin crust. A horrified neighbor boy ran for help. Frantic firemen pulled the brothers from the pond within 30 minutes. They were n't breathing and had no pulse Two helicopters and an ambulance rushed them to three separate hospitals. Thus began the agonizing pilgrimage of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Gragg </PERSON>, two ordinary people who now stagger in the footsteps of Job. Meanwhile, word of the tragedy spread like woodsmoke over this western <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> town of 2,800. The event would change forever <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON>'s image of itself. As doctors at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Blue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> told the parents their son <PERSON> Chad </PERSON> was dead, teachers and friends arrived to surround the stunned couple in a protective cocoon. Hoping against hope, the Graggs next went to <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luke </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, only to be told <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON>, too, was gone. By the time they reached Children's Mercy Hospital the Graggs were at the heart of a caravan of grief. They found <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> on a life support system. At 10 p.m., he passed away. In the space and time it took for the sun to set and the moon to rise, three healthy, happy, handsome little boys vanished from the lives of all who knew them. They left behind bits of homework and smiling celluloid images, a puppy named Scooter who looks for them everywhere, empty school desks, classmates who struggle to remember their last words, teachers who wish they'd known them better. They left behind the townspeople of <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON>, who were galvanized by the loss to dig deep within their hearts and pockets to bury the children with dignity, and continue to mourn them with honest tears. They left behind their mother and their father, but <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Gragg </PERSON>, both 41, are no longer parents. The sounds of laughter, of life, are gone from their empty house. The only noise comes from the television set. The door to the boys' bedroom is closed. The unbearable must now be borne. `` In our age, children are n't eligible to die because our expectations have been set up that children can survive anything,'' said <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, a grief counselor with <ORGANIZATION> Comprehensive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> in nearby Independence, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. `` All the time we read about children who fall into freezing water and survive. Why not <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON>, or <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>, or at least <PERSON> Stevie </PERSON>? They could n't be saved because the water was n't deep enough nor cold enough. But because of modern medical miracles, we are conditioned to believe it is outrageous that they died.'' Ms. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, whose nonprofit agency has contracts with both the local school district and fire department, has headed grief and death counseling in Buckner since the drownings. She also helped the <PERSON> Graggs </PERSON> plan their children's funeral. `` The human spirit is resilient beyond belief, and that is the hope here,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. `` At a time like this you can get swamped by the grinding pain of it. But out of that pain comes some of the most substantial character and human elegance to be found on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. You learn how people can rise up and care for one another. `` This is now a community that speaks with one voice. That phenomena is rare _ too often we are too big and fragmented a society for this to happen. But if you listen to <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON> today, what you hear is, ` We care. This matters to us. They were our children, too.''' The Graggs had no close relatives living nearby. Acting out of instinct and compassion, <ORGANIZATION> Buckner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Principal </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> stepped into the abyss. `` The school in a sense became their family,'' said <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. `` Working with me, <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the funeral director, <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> decided to have the funeral in the junior high gymnasium. The parents wanted the teachers to speak, and to be pallbearers. `` This became a chance for the community to fulfill what a community is all about. Before the accident happened you could have counted on one hand the number of people who knew <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Gragg </PERSON>. Now everyone knows them and wants to help them.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Parent-Teacher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> mobilized to take food to the <PERSON> Gragg </PERSON> home for the next two weeks. Secretly thanking God it was n't their own kids, mothers reached into closets and brought forth suits and ties for the boys to wear to their graves Funds were established to accept donations to offset medical and funeral expenses. The local bank, the savings and loan and a florist donated flower sprays for the coffins. `` It is so hard to take it in,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION>, where nearly $ 20,000 was sent in the first two weeks after the accident. Pondering the event's anguishing mathematics, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> wondered, `` if people had only one child and lost it, is n't that just as terrible as having three and losing them all? I do n't know, I simply do n't know, it's just so hard to make yourself think about it.'' <PERSON> Mortician </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> tried not to think about his own boys, aged 7 and 8, as he plotted the funeral like a general planning a battle. `` We went into this with no idea there'd be any money to pay for it. I was estimating a minimum of $ 2,500 each. I went to my vault manufacturer and coffin supplier and explained the situation. They were willing to share the burden, no matter what happened,'' said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, whose family has served as <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON>'s only morticians for three generations.

 <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> decided on three identical coffins, three identical hearses. He reserved three side-by-side plots on a gently sloping hillside in the town cemetery. From the graves you can look out over the walnut and oak trees, past dormant farm pastures, and down toward the creek where an angry crawdad once bit <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON>'s big toe, where <PERSON> Chad </PERSON> caught a two-pound lunker of a catfish, where <PERSON> Stevie </PERSON> loved to hunt for frogs. Those are the same hills and hollars <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> scampered over as a child. He, too, remembers sliding across frozen ponds with his buddies. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> steeled himself not to think about any of those memories, or the event that brought him into the Graggs' circle, `` because it is so overwhelming, so awesome, that it stops you in your tracks.'' He'd think later. First, he had a big job to do. When he'd finished embalming and dressing the dead children in their new clothes, he tucked each boy's favorite toy into the silk-lined caskets. As <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> ministered to the dead, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, along with every clergyman in town, local teachers, and reinforcements from other schools, consoled the living. `` The day after it happened we conducted emotional triage in the halls, the library, the cafeteria, and the classrooms,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. `` We had kids crying with counselors in corners everywhere you looked. Part of being young is learning how to deal with your pain. The kids were shown they could support one another and that they would n't be alone.'' Teachers read `` The Taste of Blackberries'' to all fourth and fifth graders. The book relates the tale of a boy who loses his best friend. Younger children heard `` The 10th Good Thing About Barney,'' a story of a little boy whose cat dies. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> sent letters home with every student, detailing the day's upheavel and warning parents their children `` might have tears or depression but that is expected and is normal in the grief process ...'' Attached were four pages of guidelines for dealing with the situation. `` That day we just put a Band-Aid on it, we flew by the seat of our pants,'' recalled <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. `` We decided to leave the <PERSON> Gragg </PERSON> boys' desks empty to stress the finality of death, to show some physical remains. We talked about the details. We tried to cope with the onslaught of the media but refused to let reporters talk to teachers or students. And we braced for the funeral.'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> is described by faculty, city fathers, and the <PERSON> Graggs </PERSON> as the glue that held everything together through that long weekend. Besides organizing the school's response to the tragedy, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> set up the junior high gymnasium for the funeral, helped teachers prepare their farewell remarks, acceded to any family wishes, and comforted students who attended the open coffin visitation and closed casket funeral. `` It was tough trying to make an appropriate setting for a funeral out of a basketball court, but we did it,'' said <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. He had a carpenter build a wooden schoolhouse which was then covered with flowers and presented by the students of <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> also gave the parents a brass school bell engraved with the boys' names. The gift usually is reserved for retiring teachers. `` We consider that your boys have retired to a heavenly school,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> told the Graggs. More than 600 mourners heard fourth-grade teacher <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> describe the <PERSON> Gragg </PERSON> children as `` three adventuresome, energetic little boys ... each of us has a special place in our heart, locked and guarded _ it's the place just for <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON>.'' Symbols of each boy's interests rested atop the blue-gray caskets: art materials for <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON>, a soccer ball for <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON>, a basketball for <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>. Finally, the three brothers were laid to rest in winter's hard ground. <PERSON> Mortician </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> left town for a convention in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, allowing himself to cry most of the way. Mental health counselor <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> began planning a series of forums on death and dying for the <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON> community. <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> fielded calls from <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> and tried to get his school back to some semblance of normalcy. `` The tragedy will long be remembered in this community,'' said <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, pausing to wipe tears from his eyes and catch his breath over the big lump in his throat. `` They were rambunctious country boys who were one for all and all for one. `` Two of the boys willingly gave up their lives for the other. That is the only thing that makes it comprehensible.'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gragg </PERSON>'s relatives have gone home and neighbors visit less now. <PERSON> Gragg </PERSON> has resumed the commute to his job at a metal treating company in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. His wife has returned to shift work for a janitorial contractor at the nearby <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ammunition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION>. The Graggs believe they'll stay in the neighborhood where dogs run free and kids' boundaries are defined by a stop sign on a country road. They speak of their sons in the present tense. Looking at a small pile of photographs, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Gragg </PERSON> remembers each of her sons as a sturdy blue-eyed, blonde-haired baby. `` They were so good. They slept through the night every night. `` Aaron is my artist, my loner, he loves his dinosaurs. <PERSON> Chad </PERSON> is his daddy made over, my helper, everybody's helper, such a good student. He loves school, he never misses, and he loves riding his bicycle. <PERSON> Stevie </PERSON>'s a little slow, a shy kid. <PERSON> Stevie </PERSON> loves <PERSON> Alf </PERSON> ...'' <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gragg </PERSON> takes up the sentence. `` You'll never see kids that alike, that close. If one goes out the front door the other two are right behind. ... I was n't surprised they all died trying to pull each other out of that pond `` I always told them, ` No matter what happens, you help your brothers.' I told them that more than once. I told Chad he was responsible. He was in charge. He went to help <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Stevie </PERSON> followed.'' Is there anything anyone can do for the Graggs? They say there is nothing. They are baffled that there might be an answer to such a question. Soon it will be spring, time to go fishin' again, and frog huntin', and crawdad catchin'. That's when the children of <ORGANIZATION> Buckner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> will plant three new trees in memory of <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Stevie </PERSON>. By then, the ice will be gone from the ponds.

<HEAD>Harewood Says Movie Shatters Myths About Homeless</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Dorian </PERSON> <PERSON> Harewood </PERSON> predicts that the ABC Theater presentation of `` God Bless the Child'' is going to shatter some myths about the homeless. The two-hour movie tells the story of a desperate young mother trapped in poverty and an Outreach worker who tries to help her and her young daughter. `` It's a myth that the majority of the poor and homeless are lazy and do n't want to work and want to take advantage of the welfare system,'' he said. `` The fact is that most of them do want to work, and those who are working are being paid at a sub-poverty level. `` It's a myth that the majority of the homeless are minorities. The fact is most are white. That should shake up people into solving this problem.'' <PERSON> Harewood </PERSON> stars as <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, the Outreach worker. Mare Winningham is the young Appalachian mother, <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> is <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON>, her daughter. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemec </PERSON> wrote the screenplay and <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Elikann </PERSON> directed on location in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> will telecast the movie on Monday. `` My character was inspired by a real Outreach worker, <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodard </PERSON> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Harewood </PERSON>. `` He's a very special guy who's done a lot for the homeless.'' The story's set in an unspecified Midwestern city. It follows the tribulations of the young Appalachian woman and her daughter, who through no fault of their own, are in a downward spiral of poverty. `` It's a cycle that leaves her homeless and without much prospect of improvement,'' <PERSON> Harewood </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Harewood </PERSON> notes that many programs set up in the 1960s and'70s to aid the poor have been scaled down. `` This film does n't make a political statement,'' he said, `` but it does make the statement that the government has got to become involved. Children are our greatest resource and too many are growing up malnourished. Is it any wonder that we've fallen behind the rest of the world in educating our children?'' <PERSON> Harewood </PERSON> is involved with several programs that help people in need, among them LIFE -LRB- Love Is Feeding Everyone -RRB- and CHIP-IN -LRB- Community Housing Involving People In Need -RRB-. By the time the movie goes on the air, <PERSON> Harewood </PERSON> expects to be well into the filming of a pilot for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> called `` Mama's Boys.'' He and <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> star as half-brothers who inherit an investigative newspaper. `` <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> and I are good friends and we're looking forward to working together again,'' he said. ` The movie ` Foster and <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON>' in 1975 was our only time to work together They wanted to make a series out of that, strange as it seems, since we were both assassinated -LRB- they played police officers -RRB-. `` But the chemistry between us is good. We did n't want to do that as a series, but we have been wanting to do something together for a long time.'' The idea for the series came from <PERSON> Harewood </PERSON>'s wife, actress <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>, and her friend, <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Haven </PERSON>. `` I met <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> when we did one musical in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and we started dating when we did another,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> was in ` General Hospital.''' The concept is of two half-brothers, one white, one black, who inherit the newspaper and are forced to settle their differences to keep it running. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Blinn </PERSON> -LRB- `` <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>'s Song,'' `` Roots'' -RRB- wrote the screenplay. The last year or so has been extremely busy for <PERSON> Harewood </PERSON>. He starred in <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Kubrick </PERSON>'s `` Full Metal Jacket,'' and played the title role in the TV movie `` Guilty of Innocence: The <PERSON> Lenell </PERSON> <PERSON> Geter </PERSON> <PERSON> Story </PERSON>.'' He also played a television reporter in the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> miniseries `` Amerika.'' <PERSON> Harewood </PERSON> said he also got back to singing, which had been his original goal. He has an album coming out in April called `` Love Will Stop Calling.'' `` It's R & amp; B, with some rock,'' he said. `` I hate labeling it. `` I'd gotten some good offers when I started years ago, so it's not like I'm just capitalizing on my success as an actor I've had other offers to record, but they were n't just right. I was able to do this album without slowing down my acting career.'' He may also do a musical version of `` To Sir With Love'' on Broadway with <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>. He is also planning to do a new version of `` Othello'' for <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Papp </PERSON>, with <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> directing. <PERSON> Papp </PERSON> is doing Shakespearean plays with name actors.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Switching Channels''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Hecht-Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> MacArthur </PERSON> play `` The Front Page'' has enjoyed a long career in films. <PERSON> Adolphe </PERSON> <PERSON> Menjou </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> starred in the 1931 talkie directed by <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Milestone </PERSON> and produced by <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawks </PERSON> had the brilliant idea of changing the reporter to a woman, and `` His Girl Friday'' was a 1940 hit with <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rosalind </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> went back to the 1920s era with <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthau </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON> in 1973. Now comes `` Switching Channels.'' It is patterned after `` His Girl Friday,'' with <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> as the demonic editor and <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> as his star reporter and ex-wife. But something new has been added: television. Changing from a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> newspaper to a satellite news network does surprisingly little damage to the timeless `` Front Page'' plot. If anything, the deadline urgency is more pronounced, given the competitive nature of TV news. Where the filmmakers have gone astray is in their apparent belief that `` The Front Page'' needed a heavy dose of farce. The result is more <ORGANIZATION> Marx </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> than <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> MacArthur </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, star reporter for the news network, takes a rare vacation and falls in love with a dashing industrialist, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeve </PERSON>. She returns to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and tells her news-crazy boss and former husband, <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, that she is quitting for married life. The wily <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> prevents her departure, and <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> agrees to one last assignment: the execution of an accused cop killer -LRB- <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> -RRB-. When the condemned man escapes, the chase begins. Instead of the customary roll-top desk, the reporter hides the escapee in the press room's copying machine. The actors romp through their roles in high style. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> is perfect as the fast-talking con artist, and <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> is credible as the energetic reporter. <PERSON> Reeve </PERSON> displays an unsuspected talent for comedy in the <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellamy </PERSON> role as the self-assured fiance. There is marvelous irony when the one-time Man of Steel is portrayed as a sufferer of acrophobia who panics in an elevator. Where `` Switching Channels'' goes awry is with <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Kotcheff </PERSON>'s ambivalent direction, particularly at the frenetic, unfunny climax <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Beatty </PERSON> as the puffed-up politician overacts outrageously, and the media people are portrayed as gargoyles and cretins. Oh well, `` The Front Page'' will survive. Produced by <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ransohoff </PERSON> and written by <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, `` Switching Channels'' is rated PG, perhaps for language. Running time: 104 minutes.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> was recalling when he first arrived in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> almost 30 years ago: `` I went to see a friend of a friend of a friend who was supposed to be in the movie business. It turned out he was in the insurance business and he wrote policies for a studio. He lived in the Valley, and I rented a car to follow him. `` Now, I'm from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. When I went through Laurel Canyon, I thought I was in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. I had never seen anything like that. I had the top down and was looking everywhere. I thought, ` This is about as close to heaven as I'll ever get. This is where I'll live.' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> was in a rare reflective mood during a visit to help publicize the new Tri-Star movie `` Switching Channels.'' He came here from his Jupiter, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, base to talk about the movie, which is `` The Front Page'' switched to television. But he also seemed to enjoy reminiscing about his early Hollywood days. `` When I went under contract to Universal,'' he recalled, `` it was like a campus. You could walk across the lot and see all these people who were much prettier than you. Gorgeous guys _ they all had names like <PERSON> Race </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentry </PERSON>. In those days the studios put beauty contest winners under contract. You could see Miss Universe and Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> tripping off to class.'' All contract players attended classes to learn drama, dance, singing, horseback riding and fencing. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> recalled a boxing class in which he was pitted against a smaller actor and knocked him down: `` It was <PERSON> Audie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, and he went to get a gun. As it turned out, we became good friends. But I learned never to knock down a Congressional Medal of Honor winner.'' The first big break for <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, who was once married to actress and comedian <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carne </PERSON>, came when Universal cast him in `` Riverboat,'' the first TV series in color. Co-starring with <PERSON> Darrin </PERSON> <PERSON> McGavin </PERSON> was `` a little bit like playing tackle opposite <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Alzado </PERSON>; you learn to play the game very quickly.'' Fired from `` Riverboat,'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> practiced his craft in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and returned to star in more TV series. `` I'm the only actor who has been canceled by all three networks,'' he said. After `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> August </PERSON>,'' he appeared on several <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> talk shows. <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> saw him and invited him on `` The Tonight Show.'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> was warned that <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> did n't talk between commercial breaks. But during the first one, <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> asked, `` Do you want to host the show?'' So <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> was host of 10 `` Tonight'' shows in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and was called to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> for an interview with director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Boorman </PERSON> about a role in `` Deliverance.'' It turned out <PERSON> Boorman </PERSON> had seen him as a talk-show host. `` I saw you in command of four people; that's what you have to do in this movie,'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> recalled <PERSON> Boorman </PERSON> as saying. Twenty-odd movies later, <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, 52, remains as ambitious as when he was a contract player at Universal. `` I'm healthy as a horse,'' he proclaimed, despite those rumors of three years ago that he had a fatal disease. He said a jaw injury on `` City Heat'' made eating difficult. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> was off the screen for more than two years. To dispel the rumors, he made three movies in a row: `` Heat,'' `` Malone'' and `` Rent-a-Cop,'' none of which ignited the box office. He has great hopes for `` Switching Channels,'' in which he plays the <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> role with <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> as the reporter and <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeve </PERSON> as her fiance. `` I was a late comer to the film,'' said <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>. `` I had the good fortune to live across the street from the producer, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ransohoff </PERSON>. When <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caine </PERSON> got stuck in the mouth of ` Jaws IV' and was n't available, <PERSON> Ransohoff </PERSON> was running around looking for a replacement <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> was n't available. A lot of guys were n't available. `` I was across the street eating an apple. <PERSON> Ransohoff </PERSON> came over and said, ` Read this script.' Twenty-four hours later I was in the lap of <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>,'' he said. `` The character was much more elegant with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caine </PERSON>. He changed from <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Niven </PERSON> to <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> real quickly. They switched the pictures on the wall from <LOCATION> Winston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Churchill </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagler </PERSON>. However, the dialogue was n't changed. Just some ad libs added.'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> intends to maintain the filming pace, directing as well as acting. `` I missed it,'' he admitted. `` After all those stupid rumors, I decided just to go back to work. The best revenge is the good life: to be happy and be surrounded by the people I liked most. `` It worked. I've gotten healthier and happier with each picture. Most of all I had missed the crew, the guys, the gals _ the making of the film is the most fun part of all.'' During his hiatus, he's kept a low profile, and that was part of his design: `` It was time for me to be less visible. I was seen everywhere for everything; I was doing everything but open supermarkets. -LRB- <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> used to tell me, ` You could have such a big career _ if you'd just go away.'''

 <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Zinman </PERSON>, who has been the music director of the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> since 1985, is as delighted with the orchestra as he is with the city itself. Just before <PERSON> Zinman </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> from his previous orchestra in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> philanthropist <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyerhoff </PERSON>, who'd been picking up the symphony's bills, died. `` To my horror, we had an accumulated deficit of $ 2.3 million and we were losing $ 1 million a year. We would be out of business in a year unless we raised money,'' he said. A new executive director and the board, with some new members, were told by consultants they probably could n't raise a $ 14 million endowment. `` They went out and raised $ 40 million in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> in 22 months _ a new world's record. `` It was done by business leaders, which is essentially the way it has to be done. The selling point was, if you want to have a city that's taken seriously, we have to have an orchestra,'' <PERSON> Zinman </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> had a renaissance in the last 15 years. It's a can-do town. People who live there feel they can do what they want to do. `` We did a tour of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> last May. One of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>'s banks paid for it. The governor and a senator came along. They did a presentation lunch in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, with a big slide show. Orchestra musicians played. People were invited to our concert the next night.'' The year's tour for the orchestra started March 7 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. It will continue in <LOCATION> Davis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, with cellist Yo-Yo Ma as guest. Next year, the orchestra will tour the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> with flute soloist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Galway </PERSON>. This season, <PERSON> Zinman </PERSON> started Saturday morning `` informal concerts,'' repeats of Friday night concerts with a top price of $ 9 and a little conversation. `` They said, ` You have to talk to the audience.' I'm a fan of ` Prairie Home Companion.' I decided to do it like an old radio show,'' <PERSON> Zinman </PERSON> said. `` We have a phony sponsor _ tapioca _ and a tapioca jingle. Next year we'll do eight of them, broadcast live by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>. I explain the musical themes for them to follow while they listen. We recommend that little kids do n't come; it's serious classical music with zaniness in between pieces. `` I'm an American. I'm not Viennese. I have wild ideas and fantasies. Why not let them loose when you have the chance?'' This season, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> is broadcasting 13 regular symphony concerts and the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is doing several. After the tour, <PERSON> Ma </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> will record <PERSON> Britten </PERSON>'s `` Symphony for Cello and Orchestra'' and <PERSON> Barber </PERSON>'s `` Cello Concerto'' for CBS. The orchestra has made a <ORGANIZATION> Berlioz </ORGANIZATION> album for Telarc and an album by resident composer <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Rouse </PERSON> for Nonesuch. Telarc plans to record the Schumann symphonies and an all-Elgar compact disc with the Baltimore Symphony. `` I work with my orchestra a lot,'' the 51-year-old conductor said. `` My contract calls for 20 weeks a year. I do about 24. The days are over when I want to flit about, guest conducting. `` I want to make the <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> into a great orchestra. In order to do that you have to spend time digging in the garden. You ca n't just smell the flowers You have to make them grow; you have to be there. Guest conducting does n't do much for you musically. What really does a lot for you is to work with your orchestra to develop a repertoire and a style of playing that is uniquely your own. You really then get to make the music you're capable of making. `` With guesting, you're doing pieces you know pretty well. You come in like a lover, smile, make love and go away. It's a little like the singles scene. When you're with the wife, you really have to be there for the long haul.'' The conductor's family includes a son who has a synthesizer business, a daughter in a <LOCATION> Brisbane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, dance company and a 12-year-old son living with <PERSON> Zinman </PERSON> and his wife in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zinman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> native, met the late <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Monteux </PERSON>, conductor of the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Symphony who was then 83, at <LOCATION> Tanglewood </LOCATION> one summer. Three years later, <PERSON> Zinman </PERSON> began to assist him. `` He was a great model to emulate,'' <PERSON> Zinman </PERSON> said. `` He was a master of balance and was at home in all styles of music. He had a great tradition behind him. He'd played in a string quartet for <PERSON> Brahms </PERSON>. He conducted <PERSON> Diaghilev </PERSON>'s ballets, including the first ` Rite of Spring.' He was a warm human being who got along with orchestra musicians. He was a psychologist and had wonderful patience.'' At the 1983 <ORGANIZATION> Holland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Monteux </PERSON> recommended <PERSON> Zinman </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> Chamber Orchestra when a scheduled conductor got sick. From that, <PERSON> Zinman </PERSON> became music director of the <ORGANIZATION> Netherlands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> from 1964 -77 and of the <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION> Philharmonic from 1979-82. He was the <PERSON> Rochester </PERSON> <PERSON> Philharmonic </PERSON>'s music director from 1974-85. Someday he'd like to help young conductors. `` I would like to take three pupils, use them as assistants and coach them. It's a question of finding a way to schedule that and get the money to do it,'' he said. `` I really believe you must pay back what you've borrowed.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: David Lee Roth Rocks for Nine Months</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNE PETERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The child in <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> is taking plenty of toys on his next trip: a 28-foot flying surfboard; a huge banner featuring bikini-clad women; and a regulation-size, red, white and blue Everlast boxing ring. But this is no ordinary summer vaction for the shaggy-haired rock star with the trademark scream. It's a concert tour, and the playthings are meant to wow audiences for the next nine months in arenas from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Music should look like it sounds, no matter what kind of music it is,'' <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` A lot of times this music sounds like something thundering up out of the floorboards or raining down from the heavens. Sometimes it's like rolling waves of sound. And what's a wave without somebody to surf it?'' Despite the props and an endless stream of jokes, <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> is a shrewd businessman. He knows the gimmicks will bring attention to his craft _ rock' n' roll. `` There's a lot of aerial tricks, but it's all built around the music. The band is doing more musical gymnastics than you've ever heard a rock band do,'' he said. <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, 32, is touring to promote his third solo album, `` Skyscraper.'' The record, which includes the single, `` Just Like Paradise,'' marks the first time he has tried on the producer's hat His tour began on March 4 in <LOCATION> Lakeland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` I wanted to try something different,'' <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> said. `` Always in the back of my mind I had thought about producing. But I would n't try a flight like this unless I had the tools and the know-how to do it, and I did n't feel secure with that until fairly recently. The comic book-like showman spoke about his tour, with his long, blond hair tied back in a ponytail, wearing camouflage pants and a torn T-shirt, sitting in the second row of his rehearsal hall. He was careful not to reveal too many of the tour's surprises. `` During the band's moment of patriotism, I climb a ladder to the ceiling of the arena _ Jeez, I do n't want to give it all away,'' he said, but added, `` It's death-defying stuff.'' <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>'s hometown is <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, but he moved to <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, when he was about 12 and has lived there ever since. As a child, he was inspired by television. He said he figured if all these people were entertaining him on television, maybe he could be some kind of entertainer, too. The influences which led him to music ran the gamut of groups and styles. `` If I say to you Deep Purple was a big inspiration to me and so were the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Players, you'd say, ` Oh, that's where <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> got his scream from, Deep Purple!' No, no, no, I got the scream from the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Players, I got the haircut from Deep Purple.'' He began his career after meeting <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Halen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Pasadena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. The four formed <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Halen </PERSON>, a band that set the standard for many heavy-metal bands to come, especially because of <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON>'s innovative guitar playing, and <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>'s wild-man antics. The group split up in 1985, and <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> moved on to a solo career. His new band includes lead guitarist <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Vai </PERSON>, bass guitarist <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>, drummer <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Bissonette </PERSON> and keyboardist <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuggle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>'s international tour will include some of the old <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Halen </PERSON> standards, in addition to his solo efforts, including a remake of the Beach Boy's `` California Girls'' and the bluesy `` Just a Gigolo.'' In his spare time, <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> climbs mountains, as seen on the `` Just Like Paradise'' video in which he scales a 3,000-foot-high vertical wall of granite. He said he may be reverting to his childhood, because he got the climbing bug when he was a boy scout. Climbing is a kind of therapy for him. `` You know, the most scariest place you can put yourself in has the most calming effect.'' Although experienced, he says the hobby has not made him want to conquer mountains such as <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Everest </LOCATION>. `` Something like that is a hyper-commitment,'' he said. `` I need all of my toes in order to jump around with great abandon. Inevitably, you're going to lose a finger or a toe on a trip like that. Somebody checks out early. Taking that kind of risk is not my interest. The music gives me enough of that kind of adventure. Fooling around with my career burns enough calories.'' <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> also fools around with martial arts, receiving a black belt in karate about nine years ago. At one point he experimented with kick boxing. These days, he incorporates both disciplines in his stage show. `` Martial arts has a lot of visceral impact. You can feel it _ Pow! And combining it with the music, 10,000 people say, ` Oh, did you feel that?''' Despite his devil-may-care manner, <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> is definitely a success. Two previous albums have sold more that 1 million copies, certifying them as platinum, and `` Skyscraper'' is well on its way. This does not include his revenues from the six <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Halen </PERSON> LPs that share the same honor. `` A lot of what stands for success in rock' n' roll or showbiz after a while seems like so many little trophies and prizes along the way,'' he said. `` If there's any real glory to be had it's in legend.'' All kidding aside, he insists the money he's made is not for things, but rather experiences. He said experiences provide better memories. If anything, <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>'s whole career is built around making a single point, getting across a single message: `` There's a very definite message in all of this music. People say, ` <PERSON> Dave </PERSON>, what's the message?' That's it. Imagination. Take a chance. Not just take your best shot, that's too dependable.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Dark Suspense Novels Rage On</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHLEEN MACLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The characters who inhabit Black Lizard books are contemporary losers struggling through scenes set in the sizzling middle of hell on earth. Although that may not spur hordes of readers to rush out to buy one, <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lizard </ORGANIZATION> co-founders <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gifford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> report their dark suspense novels nevertheless have become a big hit, with sales approaching $ 1 million this year. They're not worried that fans of traditional mysteries or gothic romances shun harsh Lizard novels such as `` A Ticket to Hell,'' `` The Alcoholics,'' `` Swamp Sister'' or `` A Moment to Prey.'' `` I do n't read mysteries, I do n't know anything about mysteries ... I ca n't read them,'' said <PERSON> Gifford </PERSON>, contending most are poorly written and focus primarily on advancing the plot. Black Lizard books may contain a mystery, but many do n't include a corpse or even a crime, he said. As the editor who selects the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lizard </ORGANIZATION> lineup, <PERSON> Gifford </PERSON> has a clear vision of what fits and what does n't, and he has no intention of trying to attract the fainthearted. These thrillers are `` not just hard-boiled. They're books with a certain psychological edge,'' he said. Many of Black Lizard's readers are young, and <PERSON> Gifford </PERSON> speculated they may share the generally nihilistic views presented in the novels Consider this classic Black Lizard example from `` Cassidy's Girl'' by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodis </PERSON>: `` A feeling of vague uneasiness took root inside him and grew and sharpened and became acute He knew he was disappointed because the battle had n't continued. Of course, he told himself, that did n't make sense. But then there were very few elements in his life with <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON> that made sense. And lately, he recalled, there was absolutely nothing that made sense. It was getting worse all the time.'' In Black Lizard's own bibliography, the novels are described as presenting `` distinctive and absolutely authentic -LRB- mostly -RRB- American voices; satirical, maddening, compelling, fascinating.'' According to <PERSON> Gifford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lizard </ORGANIZATION> has become so successful that major publishing companies are trying to imitate the innovations of the small <ORGANIZATION> Creative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> company that has carried the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lizard </ORGANIZATION> imprint since 1983. That's when <PERSON> Gifford </PERSON> was browsing in a <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> bookstore and discovered a stack of <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittington </PERSON> novels, many of them the same `` dark'' 25-cent paperbacks that he loved to read as a kid while hanging out at his <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> neighborhood drugstore. While the books' popularity had plunged in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since the'50s, they remained a strong favorite with the French, who have shown steady appreciation of the `` serie noire'' storyline of such authors as <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Whittington </PERSON> and <PERSON> Goodis </PERSON>. `` It best represents the vision of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that the French like to retain,'' <PERSON> Gifford </PERSON> said. `` It's kind of like the Wild West.'' Filmmaker <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Truffaut </PERSON> claimed <PERSON> Goodis </PERSON> as one of his favorites, filming the writer's `` Shoot the Piano Player.'' <PERSON> Goodis </PERSON> also wrote `` Dark Passage,'' and did the screenplay as well for the <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogart-Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacall </PERSON> film. <PERSON> Gifford </PERSON>'s own `` Port Tropique'' is in pre-production for a movie. He said his friend, best-selling novelist <PERSON> Elmore </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, routinely calls to suggest <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lizard </ORGANIZATION> nab a certain new author or novel. `` It's become a writers' series as well,'' <PERSON> Gifford </PERSON> said. But the company's budget remains relatively small and it's impossible for it to lure big names such as <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> And some <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> publishing houses trying to duplicate <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lizard </ORGANIZATION> have landed certain books and authors by paying higher fees. Even so, <PERSON> Black </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizard </PERSON> founders are confident that by retaining the novels' strong identity it will survive and flourish. `` You can fill it -LRB- a company's booklist -RRB- with a lot of glop, but pretty soon your readership falls away,'' said <PERSON> Gifford </PERSON>. `` I think we're just going to get better at what we do, not necessarily bigger,'' <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> said. Despite Black Lizard's surge in popularity, <PERSON> Gifford </PERSON> said he was n't sure what to expect at first: `` I thought it would either catch on right away or we would n't sell more than 10 books. I did n't expect a mediocre reaction.'' They started out printing 5,000 copies for each of their first three books. Today they begin with 10,000 copies each, reprinting when necessary. Their booklist totals 43. Black Lizard is publishing its first hardcovers this spring and bookstore chains such as <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON> and Waldenbooks have placed orders. Black Lizard books are easy to spot. In addition to the trademark lizard logo taken from a Peruvian stone rubbing and strategically placed on each cover, most of the novels also feature haunting, lurid cover designs by <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> artist <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirwin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gifford </PERSON> said they decided to tone down the focus of the novel cover after the first three, making it less violent and graphic yet `` something that can penetrate the psyche. ... It's almost like a dream.'' The covers have become so successful that contrary to the old maxim, some people judge Black Lizard books by their covers and buy them for that reason alone.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: No More Double Vision on `Hee Haw'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Hager </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Twins </ORGANIZATION> no longer stand in the `` Hee Haw'' cornfields or get smacked from the rear by a swinging board fence. The brothers, who often gave viewers double vision, are off the cornball program after 18 years. They left the syndicated show two seasons ago, and in their appearances across the country, they still tell jokes in the finest `` Hee Haw'' tradition: What do you get when you jump in front of a car? `` Tire'' d. What do you get when you jump behind a car? `` Exhaust'' ed. Where do you take old melons and cantaloupes? To <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cougar </PERSON>'s mellon camp Last year they performed for about three months in the <LOCATION> Smoky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> resort town of <LOCATION> Gatlinburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> lived briefly after leaving the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ministry. Never one to miss an opportunity, the Hagers came up with some humor about the former evangelists. Did you hear about <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s new magazine? RePenthouse. `` I think we drove them out of town,'' recalled <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hager </PERSON>, the older of the twins by 20 minutes. The two perform on cruises, at rodeos, benefits, exhibitions and state and county fairs. They frequently appear on The <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Network </LOCATION> on cable TV, do TV commercials and are now putting songs together for an album. They appeared in the <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> movie, `` Twin Detectives,'' about 10 years ago. In the works now is a 30-minute situation comedy-variety show tentatively called `` Doubles.'' `` We're different, being twins,'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hager </PERSON> said. `` We can tell a joke pretty good, I guess.'' The two will always be known for their singing and skits on `` <PERSON> Hee </PERSON> <PERSON> Haw </PERSON>.'' They were original cast members, dating back to the first show in 1968. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> grew up watching us,'' <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hager </PERSON> said in an interview as <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> sat alongside. `` We'll always be associated with the show.'' The two were born in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area and adopted at age 3 by a Methodist minister. They've been together all their lives except for 3 -LCB- years when <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and moved to <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> remained on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, but finally followed. `` We get along; it's more profitable,'' <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> said. `` To go along, we've got to get along,'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> said. The two, who are also guitarists and drummers, had worked with country star <PERSON> Buck </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> and used his connection to join `` Hee Haw'' when <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> signed as the show's co-host with <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. `` We auditioned and signed a contract that day,'' <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> recalled. They remained on the show until two seasons ago when a contract dispute arose and they decided to concentrate on other projects. `` It gave us national exposure and made us a lot of friends,'' <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> said. `` The pay was not that good but we got $ 1 million in exposure. It kept us off the street for a long time. The police knew where we were.'' `` ` Hee Haw' made country music. It brought country music into city homes,'' he said. The Hagers are not the only familiar faces gone from the show. <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> left at the same time they did, saying he wanted to focus on his business interests. Mainstays Junior Samples, <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> all have died in recent years. But the program continues to showcase the major names in country music, from such pioneers as <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Acuff </PERSON> to emerging stars such as <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Travis </PERSON>. And the cornpone humor remains. `` They're not all platinum,'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hager </PERSON> said. `` The writers count on the person delivering the line to pull it off. It was cornball, no denying it.'' He said about the success of the show, `` People laughed at themselves. They liked the chemistry on the show and the fast pace.'' In their personal appearances, the two perform country hits such as <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>' `` Daytime Friends,'' <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbitt </PERSON>'s `` Driving My Life Away'' and <PERSON> Charley </PERSON> <PERSON> Pride </PERSON>'s `` Kiss an Angel Good Morning.'' They describe their humor as suitable for the family with nothing off-color. `` We do n't need to do that -LRB- risque material -RRB- because it's being done already. It's not what the audiences expect of us,'' <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hager </PERSON> said. Their life off-camera and off-stage is not all laughs, but levity is valued. `` We have our serious moments, but I prefer a good laugh to a good frown,'' <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hager </PERSON> said.

 `` Never Die Young'' -LRB- CBS -RRB- _ <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> `` Never Die Young'' is classic <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, which is to say warm, melodic, soothing, thoughtful, reminiscent of `` Sweet Baby James'' _ progressive but just as personal. The LP's title comes from the fine cut: `` Never give up, never slow down, never grow old, never die young.'' Love seems to be in bloom once again in the rock world. Well, sort of. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON> recently turned away from larger issues to tackle the subject in `` Tunnel of Love.'' `` Never Die Young'' is <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s two-cents' worth. It's prettier and more cutting. On the cover of `` Tunnel of Love,'' <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON> leans on a convertible on a beach. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> puts a lone wolf on `` Never Die Young.'' It's the call of the wild. His affinity for the wild life helped destroy his marriage with singer-songwriter <PERSON> Carly </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, and he talks a lot here about troubled relationships. Take `` Valentine's Day,'' which starts as a silly sweet ode to romance: `` Beneath the tide the fishes glide, fin to fin and side to side, for fishy love has now begun, fishy love, finny fun.'' But in later verses, its true nature surfaces: `` Me and you, you and him, him and her, us and them, we keep score, love as war, Valentine's Day.'' `` Runaway Boy'' is a slice of Zydeco that inspires <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> to declare he's cleaning up his act: `` I'm gon na give up believing I was born to run, and stop acting like a man that gets shot from a gun. I'm putting down roots, I want to soak up the sun and stay right here until my days are done.'' `` Sweet Potato Pie'' is the most commercial cut, a happy bounce down a latter-day Tin Pan Alley. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> even rhymes June, moon, spoon and loon. `` Never Die Young'' is tough, pretty, loose, funny _ just about perfect. Luckily for us, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> took his own advice. _ By <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Pontiac'' -LRB- MCA-Curb -RRB- _ <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovett </PERSON> Country singer <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovett </PERSON> looks more like a Pet Shop Boy than an Oak Ridge Boy, so it's no surprise that `` Pontiac'' is slightly off center. The tone is set by the opening song, `` If I Had a Boat,'' wherein <PERSON> Lovett </PERSON> recalls the time <PERSON> Tonto </PERSON> told off the Lone Ranger. It's impossible not to like. Other highlights are the title cut, which could have been writen by <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> in a dark mood; `` <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>,'' with a violent climax that <PERSON> Lovett </PERSON> nearly sneaks past the listener; and three hilarious songs about the art of compromise _ `` Give Back My Heart,'' `` She's No Lady'' and `` She's Hot to Go.'' <PERSON> Lovett </PERSON> includes several graceful bows to traditional <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> as well. The best is `` Walk Through the Bottomland,'' which features <PERSON> Emmylou </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' harmony on the chorus. <PERSON> Lovett </PERSON>, who co-produced, does n't clutter the arrangements. But along with pedal steel and piano, he effectively uses horns and, on the title song, a cello. Altogether, `` Pontiac'' is a most enjoyable ride. _ By <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Wine </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 Crude oil futures prices have moved above $ 16 per barrel on the strength of a big jump in heating oil prices that analysts said was prompted by reports of bad weather in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Circle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s agreement to buy 473 7-Eleven stores from <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reflects the continuing strength of the convenience store industry. `` They've been growing rapidly,'' said <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, a retail analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of convenience stores, noting there are more than 70,000 such outlets across the country <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION> decided to sell the 473 stores in 10 states to its chief competitor not because it's getting out of the business, but because it needs to raise more than $ 147 million to help finance the founding <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> family's $ 4.9 billion leveraged buyout of the company in December. <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION> plans to keep selling stores until it has between 7,000 and 7,300 by the end of 1989, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Markeeta </PERSON> <PERSON> McNatt </PERSON>. The company will have 7,542 stores after the Circle K transaction, down from the 8,296 it held before beginning its divestiture plan. Despite the sales, <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION> will remain the largest convenience store operator in the country and the world. `` We have such a solid name now that we do not feel that name recognition is a problem,'' Ms. <PERSON> McNatt </PERSON> said. `` We are firmly planted in the minds of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> as the convenience store people.'' <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION>'s plans fit right in with Circle K's desire to expand. The Phoenix-based convenience store operator has been growing by leaps and bounds in recent years and the latest acquisition will give it just over 4,000 outlets in 25 states. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Plumb </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for Circle K, said the company was looking to continue its expansion and hoped to have a total of 5,000 stores by 1990. The company is negotiating the purchase of another 500 stores in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> from the <ORGANIZATION> Charter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, she said. The 7-Eleven stores will be converted to the Circle K name, she said. The $ 147 million purchase price for the 473 7-Eleven stores includes real estate and other assets, and Circle K will pay an additional amount for store inventories, <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jere </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. Included in the sale are all of <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION>'s convenience stores in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> McNatt </PERSON> said. The proposed transaction, subject to a definitive agreement and government approval, also includes 63 stores in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>; three in <LOCATION> Yuma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>; 18 in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>; 57 stores in small <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> markets; and 23 stores in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION>. Many of the stores also sell gasoline, which further increases their attractiveness, said <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>. Convenience stores are successful because they give consumers a place to buy quickly one or two items, such as coffee or cigarettes. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said the stores also have been successful because they tend to be innovative, offering automatic cash machines and video cassette rentals to increase their main attraction _ convenience. <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 4.9 billion leveraged buyout took the chain private and cemented the control of the founding <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> family. In a leveraged buyout, investors use mostly borrowed funds to acquire a company. The debt is repaid with the target company's cash flow or with money raised by selling its assets <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION> already has sold 270 7-Eleven stores to <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convenience </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>, the third-largest convenience store operator with about 1,170 outlets. <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION> also has announced definitive agreements for the divestiture of its Chief Auto Parts, <ORGANIZATION> Dairies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tidel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> and MovieQuik videocassette rental operations. The company also plans to divest its Reddy Ice, Snack Foods and Chemical-Food Labs divisions.

 Blending the operations of Dr <ORGANIZATION> Pepper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and The <ORGANIZATION> Seven-Up </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> will allow the companies to continue an aggressive style in the beverage industry, company officials say. The boards of directors at holding companies for Dr Pepper and <ORGANIZATION> Seven-Up </ORGANIZATION> announced the merger of operations on Monday. The transaction, which is contingent on a definitive agreement and regulatory approval, was expected to be completed in 60 to 90 days. Groups led by the Dallas-based investment partnership <ORGANIZATION> Hicks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Haas </PERSON> acquired Dr Pepper and Seven-Up October in separate transactions during 1986. One group acquired <ORGANIZATION> Dr </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pepper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 416 million in August 1986 and another group bought <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Up </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 240 million two months later. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haas </PERSON>, co-chairmen of both companies, said the merger was a culmination of `` superb achievement'' at both companies since their acquisition. No management changes were expected, the pair said in a prepared statement `` The combination of our two companies will enable us to continue our aggressive style in this industry, as demonstrated by our recent introduction of two new products, 7Up Gold and Diet 7Up Gold,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Albers </PERSON>, who is chief executive of both companies. The operations of the two companies have been increasingly integrated in recent months, the companies said. For instance, they each have used manufacturing facilities in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> to produce soft drink concentrate. `` The merger will allow the companies to be completely operated as one company, which has obvious advantages internally and in the marketplace,'' said <PERSON> Albers </PERSON>. The trade newsletter Beverage Digest estimated the two companies captured about 10.7 percent of the $ 38 billion soft drink market in 1987, up from 10.4 percent the previous year. The soft drink leaders are <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, whose various brands accounted for 40.3 percent of the soft drink market last year, and <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which had 30.2 percent, according to the newsletter based in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` This formalizes a close and efficient relationship,'' said <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, who follows the beverage industry for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` It will help them compete better in the marketplace.''

 <ORGANIZATION> R.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has proposed a merger with <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> with an indicated value of about $ 6.6 billion, apparently topping a rival $ 6.1 billion offer from Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> said late Monday night. The offer from <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> was disclosed as <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s board considered a $ 68 a share negotiated offer from <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> for all of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s 89.6 million common shares outstanding. Privately-held <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION>'s would make a cash tender offer for approximately 80 percent of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s outstanding shares at $ 73.80 per share, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> shares not purchased in the tender offer would be exchanged in a merger transaction, for a number of newly issued shares of <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> common stock, equal to approximately 40 percent of the unpurchased shares. No value immediately could be placed on the stock portion of the buyout offer, but the total offer would be worth about $ 6.6 billion if valued at $ 73.80 in cash or stock for all of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s shares. The Federated board took no action on the <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> bid but directed its management and advisers to investigate <PERSON> Macy </PERSON>'s proposals, to negotiate a definitive agreement and submit both negotiated agreements to the board as soon as possible, the company stated <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> officials did not know when the board would get the proposals, according to spokeswoman <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanger </PERSON>. The board of directors of the merged company, which would be renamed <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> - <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, would include significant representation from the existing <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> board, <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION>'s management and financial adivisers spoke at the board meeting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION>'s offices in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> were closed when <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> announced the proposal late Monday, and a spokesman could not be reached for comment. The <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> proposal was subject to execution of a definitive merger agreement, and to approval by the boards of directors and stockholders of both companies. A number of <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION>'s outside directors already have participated in the deliberations, with respect to the combination, Ms. <PERSON> Sanger </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> was taken private in a $ 3.6 billion management leveraged buyout in 1986. Its stockholders and directors include <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Taubman </PERSON>, a major shopping mall developer, and <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON>, chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Loews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The company is one of the nation's biggest and best known retailers, with $ 5.21 billion in sales during the year ended last Aug. 1. <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> operates 100 department stores and recently opened three specialty clothing stores. Cincinnati-based Federated is a $ 10.5 billion diversified retailer with more than 650 department stores, supermarkets and other retail outlets nationwide.

A <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman declined earlier Monday to comment on the last-minute bid, although <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> repeatedly has stated it wanted the opportunity to meet competing offers. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> stock closed up $ 2 at $ 66.50 a share in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading Monday. The Federated board, after rejecting three alternative, hostile tender offers from <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, announced Friday it had authorized merger negotiations with the Toronto-based retailing and real estate company. In addition to the <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> proposal, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s board had been considering whether to entirely shun purchase offers in favor of a restructuring that woudl keep present management in control. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, which acquired giant <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in December 1986, has been pressing its takeover attempt since Jan. 25. Some industry analysts have said they expect <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> to continue soliciting other buyers to fend off <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s overtures.

<HEAD>Saturn Begins Recruiting Workers for Tennessee Assembly Plant</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s newest carmaking division has begun recruiting the first 3,000 factory workers for its <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, assembly plant, <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. The Saturn plant will begin production in the summer of 1990 for the 1991 model year. Most workers will be hired in mid-1989, when <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> begins production on pilot models, said <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> representatives will tour <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> facilities around the nation, explaining directly to workers for the first time how <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> will work and what a job there would be like. Saturn already has received a number of resumes, but the push announced Monday is the first real recruitment effort it has made. Under an agreement between <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> workers will get the first 6,000 Saturn jobs available over time, including the initial 3,000. Saturn workers will be covered by a separate labor contract from the national GM-UAW pact. Like Japanese automakers that have hired for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories, including <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION>'s hiring process will be lengthy Potential Saturn workers will go through an assessment process intended to give them an idea of what <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> work will be like and whether they want to do it, while giving <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> an idea of how well the prospective employee works in a team situation, <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> employees will work in teams, instead of performing more traditional auto assembly work that consists of repeating one precise task over and over. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> said the Saturn plant probably will run on two shifts. Workers' salaries will amount to 80 percent of <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> hourly workers' base pay, with the 20 percent difference made up in incentive pay linked to such factors such as productivity increases and <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION>'s profitability, <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> said. Active or laid-off workers who leave the <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> system for <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> automatically give up any recall rights and seniority at <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> plants, she said. But at <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION>, their jobs would be protected during industry slumps because the company will be required to look for ways to cut its inventory that exclude laying off workers, <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Giuliani Assumes Suing of Goodyear In False Claims Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government has filed a lawsuit seeking at least $ 21 million from <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for allegedly falsifying price information about balloon-type devices used to guide bombs. The suit, originally filed last year by a competitor, was taken over by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> and filed Monday in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. The suit names <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary called <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Loral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which bought the subsidiary last year. `` Goodyear is confident that once the facts in the case are examined objectively, the suit will be found without merit and the charges dropped,'' <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> McClenny </PERSON> said from his <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, office. The case involves two devices called Air Inflatable Retarder Assemblies that are used to slow and guide the flight of MK 500-pound and 1,000-pound bombs dropped from low-flying airplanes. The government charged that <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> misrepresented prices and costs of the labor involved; that the company unlawfully induced a subcontractor to lower its price; and that it failed to disclose substantial price reductions proposed for a subcontractor. <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> was the only maker of the devices from 1982 to 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Irvin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> entered the competition and filed a $ 100 million antitrust suit in 1986. <PERSON> Irvin </PERSON> allegedly turned up information about fraud against the government that it used in another suit it filed in 1987. That suit was filed on behalf of the government under a `` whistleblower'' law that allows the government to take over a suit. The suit filed Monday asks for at least $ 21 million in damages under the False Claims Act and common law theories. In addition, the government is seeking $ 10,000 for each unspecified false claim. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Loral </ORGANIZATION>, who asked not to be identified, said that those alleged practices would have occurred before <ORGANIZATION> Loral </ORGANIZATION> bought the company and the potential for a lawsuit was known before the purchase. He added, however, that `` Loral is confident the appropriate management practices are in place that are consistent with government procurement practices.''

 <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spoor </PERSON>, formerly at the helm of of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, is coming out of retirement to take over his old job. The company announced Monday that its board of directors at a regular meeting in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, elected <PERSON> Spoor </PERSON> chairman and chief exectuive officer to replace <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>, who resigned. It did n't give a reason for the management shakeup. Contacted in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> on Monday, <PERSON> Spoor </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> that other management changes will be announced today. `` There wo n't be any firings, but we will be changing people and responsibilities,'' <PERSON> Spoor </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Spoor </PERSON> described himself as a `` very interim'' CEO, adding, `` This does n't please me at all.'' `` The one thing this is n't is power plays and politics,'' he said. `` Jack -LRB- <LOCATION> Stafford </LOCATION> -RRB- and I are good friends. I chose him to succeed me.'' Asked why <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON> quit, <PERSON> Spoor </PERSON> said, `` You'll have to ask him. It just reached a point where it was no longer worth it to him.'' <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, company spokesman, said <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON> was unavailable for comment. He said his departure was voluntary and that he left with no ties to <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> also said the board of directors appointed a search committee to seek a chief executive for the company to succeed <PERSON> Spoor </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>, 51, presided in fiscal 1987 over the company's first earnings decline in 16 years. Earnings were $ 1.82 million, or $ 2.10 a share, down from $ 2.08 million, or $ 2.38 a share, in fiscal 1986. Stock analysts who were projecting fiscal 1988 earnings of about $ 2.80 a share were told by <LOCATION> Stafford </LOCATION> in February to lower the projections by about 30 cents a share, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. `` That may have been the straw that broke the camel's back,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Carver </PERSON>, a food industry analyst with Minneapolis-based <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jaffray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Hopwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` He has been under increasing pressure by the board. That may have been what did him in.'' <PERSON> Carver </PERSON> said declining performance in <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s restaurant division led to the the sharp earnings decline in fiscal 1987. But when <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON> told analysts to lower their projections for fiscal 1988 earnings, he said it was because of an expected earnings decline in the consumer foods division, which includes frozen pizza, desserts and mixes. The announcement came as a surprise, <PERSON> Carver </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Spoor </PERSON>, 65, remained on the company's board of directors after retiring as chairman and chief executive in 1985. In September his involvement in the company increased when he was selected chairman of the executive committee.

 The stock market stuttered at the start today after zooming to a new post-crash high on Monday. The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 blue-chip stocks slipped 0.50, or 0.02 percent, to 2,071.12 in the first half hour of trading. But in the broader market, stocks gaining in price slightly outnumbered losers in the early going by 397 to 372 with 432 issues unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> totaled 29.88 million as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street, down markedly from Monday when early dividend plays on utility stocks touched off heavy trading. Analysts said traders received mixed signals from economic data released this morning. The government said its chief economic forecasting gauge dropped a sharp 0.6 percent in January, but an upward revision for December eased fears of an imminent recession. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported a month ago that the index had declined 0.2 percent in December after falling in October and November. Today's report, however, revised the December calculation to show an increase of 0.3 percent. Three consecutive monthly declines in the index is the traditional, but not infallible, signal of an impending recession. Also today, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said construction spending tumbeld 2.9 percent in January, the biggest decline in 10 months. The drop followd a 0.4 percent increase in December and evidenced weakness in both housing and non-residential building, economists said. Aside from the inconclusive economic signals, market traders were expected to focus on the latest rash of takeover deals, which helped propel Monday's advance. Analysts said they did not expect any sharp reversals like the one that followed the market's brief January rally. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks lost 0.27 to 150.19 in early trading. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index was up 0.44 to 288.90. On Monday, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 48.41 to 2,071.62, reaching its highest point since the October crash. The run left the Dow average 20 points higher than the previous post-crash peak of 2,051.89 on Jan. 7. The January advance ended abruptly with a 140-point plunge in the Dow the next day. Advancing issues on Monday outnumbered declines by about 7 to 2 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 1,257 up, 353 down and 357 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume totaled 236.05 million shares, against 191.09 million in the previous session. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index gained 2.76 to 150.46.

 <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> is prospecting for another big gold strike, this time making a $ 1.9 billion cash offer for <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's biggest gold producer. The offer disclosed Monday came about three months after the noted raider aborted an unsuccessful hostile takeover bid for <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, another major gold producer, and as <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> is engaged in battles at <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> KN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The Pickens-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Mesa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partnership </ORGANIZATION> offered to pay $ 20 a share for the 93 million outstanding common shares of <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION> in a negotiated agreement. <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> already controls about 3.8 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION>'s stock. <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION> said it would consider the unsolicited proposal and reply `` in due course,'' but declined to elaborate. The company's stock shot up $ 3.50 to $ 18 a share Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, but backtracked to $ 17.75 in early trading today. Based in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION> holds interests in oil and natural gas and mines uranium, silver and gold, as does <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION>. Founded in 1877, <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION> has an estimated 10 million ounces of reserves, worth roughly $ 4.3 billion based on the current gold price of about $ 430 an ounce. It reportedly produced 678,000 ounces last year. New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> last year was the target of <ORGANIZATION> Ivanhoe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, a group led by <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>, which made a $ 2 billion hostile bid for control of the company. That move was blocked in October when a <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> court upheld a `` market sweep'' in which <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION>'s biggest shareholder, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, snapped up enough shares in a two-day buying binge to raise its holdings to nearly 50 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> and thwart the hostile bid <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> made his reputation with high-profile bids for several major oil companies in the early 1980s, including <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> launched hostile bids for such companies and then pocketed millions of dollars in profit when the target company either was bought out by a higher bidder or repurchased its own stock Last year, in addition to the move against <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> triggered takeover speculation by acquiring significant stakes in <ORGANIZATION> Singer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, but no actual offer for either company ever was disclosed. Singer later was taken private by investor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> in a $ 1.06 billion buyout, in which <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> participated. Recently, <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> announced his intention to seek federal approval to acquire up to 15 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, and said he would support actions by fellow takeover strategist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> to gain seats on the oil giant's board of directors and strip the company's takeover defenses In addition, <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> earlier this month extended a prolonged campaign against <ORGANIZATION> KN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, disclosing he would seek a seat on the <LOCATION> Lakewood </LOCATION>, Colo.-based gas pipeline company's board of directors. <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> said it owns 400,000 <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION> shares directly and also holds a 45 percent interest in a partnership that owns about 3.1 million <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION> shares. <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> has entered into an agreement to purchase the remaining 55 percent of the partnership, which would leave <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> with a 3.8 percent share in <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION>, the company's statement said In a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Conger </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> was prepared to proceed promptly with the purchase and was confident it could arrange financing for the acquisition. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> also offered to allow key personnel at <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION> to acquire equity stakes in the merged company, `` and thereby be positioned to benefit directly from the success of their efforts.'' <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION> posted a profit last year of $ 146.4 million, or $ 1.51 per share, compared with net income of $ 22.6 million, or 23 cents a share, in 1986. Revenue rose to $ 516.2 million from $ 347.6 million. The 1987 profit included gains of $ 95 million on the sale of 20 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Australia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, and $ 5.7 million from the sale of exploration properties in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION> is incorporated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, which recently enacted a law aimed at hindering hostile corporate takeovers.

 The government reported today that its main economic forecasting gauge tumbled 0.6 percent in January, but an upward revision in the index of leading economic indicators for December eased fears of a recession this year. In a separate report, the government said construction spending fell 2.9 percent in January, the biggest decline since a 3.3 percent drop in March 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that construction spending fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 395.2 billion in January following a 0.4 percent increase in December. In the report on leading indicators, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> revised its report for December to reflect a 0.3 percent increase in the index rather than the 0.2 percent decline it initially reported. The index had fallen in October and November. Three consecutive monthly declines in the index is the traditional, but not infallible, signal of an impending recession. Thus, the revision in the December index was taken by economists as a heartening sign that the country is unlikely to suffer a downturn this year. On Monday, the stock market jumped to its highest level since the Oct. 19 market meltdown amid new signs of economic optimism. Analysts said there was no major economic news to account for the burst of stock-buying on Monday, which sent the widely-watched Dow Jones industrial average up by 48.41 points to 2,071.62. But traders were heartened to see the Dow industrials vault past the 2,051.89 level after failing to do so last week. The average stood at that point on Jan. 7 for its previous highest closing reading since the crash. In late-morning trading today, however, the closely watched indicator stood at 2,068.80, down 2.82. Separately, a survey released Monday indicated that economists for major corporations have become more upbeat about the economy than they were three months ago, not long after the Oct. 19 stock collapse that wiped out half a trillion dollars in stock wealth. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economists </ORGANIZATION> said its latest member survey that only one-fourth of its members predicted a recession in 1988, down from more than half in the previous survey. But an overwhelming 83 percent of the analysts said a downturn was very likely before the end of the next president's first year in office. In other economic news on Monday: _ Prices farmers got for raw products in February declined an average of 0.8 percent from January but still were 6.6 percent above those a year earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said _ Gold prices tumbled in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> but rebounded sharply in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, based on a stunning rally in platinum that traders ascribed to fear of unrest in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, a leading producer of precious metals At midmorning in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> today, dealers fixed a recommended gold price of $ 429.15 a troy ounce, down from an opening bid of $ 431.30 but up from Monday's late bid of $ 425.

 The stock market stumbled to a small loss today after zooming to a new post-crash high on Monday. The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 blue-chip stocks was down 2.82, or 0.14 percent, to 2,068.80 in the first 90 minutes of trading. Analysts said they expected to see the market follow through on Monday's advance, but results in the broader market were disappointing in the early going. Stocks losing ground outnumbered gainers by 708 to 595 with 450 issues unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> totaled 75.04 million as of 11 a.m. on Wall Street, down markedly from Monday when dividend plays on utility stocks touched off heavy trading. Analysts said traders received mixed signals from economic data released this morning. The government said its chief economic forecasting gauge dropped a sharp 0.6 percent in January, but an upward revision for December eased fears of an imminent recession. Also today, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said construction spending tumbled 2.9 percent in January, the biggest decline in 10 months. But as in the case of the leading index, the drop followed a revised 0.4 percent increase in December. Analysts said the figures were in line with expectations and had little impact on trading. Aside from the economic data, market traders were expected to focus on the latest rash of takeover deals, which helped propel Monday's surge. Among the most active stocks on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> gained 1 \ to 67 -RCB- following <ORGANIZATION> R.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> offer of $ 73.80-per-share for about 80 percent of the company's outstanding shares <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which has been chasing <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> with a bid of $ 68 per share, said <PERSON> Macy </PERSON>'s offer was `` simply not competitive.'' <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> was down -LRB- to 45 -RRB-, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> was up ~ to 37 |, <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s was down -LRB- to 7 -RRB-; <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was up -LRB- to 117 |; and <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> was down \ to 29 The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks lost 0.50 to 149.96 at mid-morning. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index was up 0.67 to 289.13. On Monday, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 48.41 to 2,071.62, reaching its highest point since the October crash. The run left the Dow average 20 points higher than the previous post-crash peak of 2,051.89 on Jan. 7. The January advance ended abruptly with a 140-point plunge in the Dow the next day.

 Script writers and entertainment producers, trying to hammer out a strike-averting contract settlement, called a recess today after a 21-hour bargaining session. The <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> said in a brief statement that negotiators recessed at 7:15 a.m. and agreed to return at noon. Both sides declined to say if an agreement was near, but alliance and union officials earlier expressed pessimism. The old contract for the 9,000 members expired at midnight Monday with no resolution to the union's demands for greater creative control on the set and more money from television residuals. `` It does n't look optimistic,'' said <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION>, which represents about 6,500 writers on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and 2,500 on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. `` The situation is not good,'' agreed <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION>. The writers produce scripts for productions ranging from daytime soap operas and talk shows to prime-time dramas and feature films. A strike would be felt first by daily daytime programs and talk shows, Ms. <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said. She said it would take longer for the effects of a walkout to become visible on shows produced in advance that need fewer scripts. Negotiators were still at the bargaining table at 5 a.m. this morning and were expected to wrap up today. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> union members would vote tonight on whether to approve the producers' final offer or strike. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> members will vote Wednesday, and results of the two votes are n't expected to be available until about noon Wednesday. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>, the guild's chief negotiator, said going into the final round of talks Monday evening that the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> would stay at the bargaining table as long as possible. But he criticized the producers' alliance for allegedly spreading stories of widespread financial problems in the industry. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> responded that the industry as a whole was doing well but makers of one-hour television series are suffering because of difficulty selling their products into syndication. Main issues separating the two sides were disputes over creative rights, residuals from foreign markets and residuals for one-hour programs. The median annual income for writers is $ 40,000, but about half of the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION>'s members are unemployed at any given time, Ms. <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said. The entertainment arm of the writers' union, which has a reputation as one of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s most militant, last went on strike three years ago. That walkout lasted two weeks before writers voted to accept a package offering them essentially the same terms as the one they had earlier voted down. Ms. <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said the guild also represents about 600 television news writers, who struck <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and CBS last spring, but they operate under a different agreement and were n't affected by the negotiations.

<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures opened steady to lower today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. A late rally Monday sparked some overnight farmer selling of corn and soybeans, and that helped limit further gains on the opening today, analysts said. Wheat traders were encouraged by news of new purchases by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement that it had sold less than 16 million bushels in last Friday's weekly auction of surplus wheat. But advances in wheat futures were limited by concerns about this afternoon's <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> auction, the first in a series of three weekly auctions that will replace the once-a-week sales, analysts said. `` That's taking a little edge off the enthusiam over the Soviets buying wheat overnight,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> for G.H. <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. In early trading, wheat was 1 cent lower to \ cent higher with the contract for delivery in March at $ 3.14 -LCB- a bushel; corn was unchanged to \ cent lower with March at $ 2.03 -RCB- a bushel; oats were unchanged to -RCB- cent higher with March at $ 1.95 a bushel; soybeans were \ cent to -RCB- cent lower with March at $ 6.35 \ a bushel Livestock and meat futures were higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .30 cent to .55 cent higher with April at 71.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .28 cent to .60 cent higher with March at 80.15 cents a pound; live hogs were .02 cent to .30 cent higher with April at 43.27 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .05 cent to .28 cent higher with March at 51.90 cents a pound. Livestock and meat futures settled sharply lower on Monday.

 Farmers who received some government information late have been given additional time to file their 1987 federal income-tax returns. The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it was granting special relief to farmers who did not receive <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> documents by the Feb. 15 scheduled date. Those documents are Form 1099-G, which reflects certain government payments, and Form 1099-A, on which acquisitions or abandonments of secured property are reported. Farmers generally are not subject to penalties for underpayments if they file their returns by March 1. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> concluded that farmers who failed to receive required information from the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> by Feb. 15 might be unable to meet the March 1 deadline. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> said farmers affected by the delay should attach to their tax return a Form 2210F on which they have written their name and Social Security number and, on the bottom right, the words `` farm waiver.'' With the extension, farmers will have to file returns and pay any tax owed by April 15, the deadline for most taxpayers.

 Most mornings <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> can be found standing at the side of the city's majestic Metropolitan Cathedral, waiting with dozens of other unemployed tradesmen for a lucky break _ a day's earnings as a plumber. <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>, 25, has been coming for about a decade to this spot in downtown <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, a traditional gathering point for tradesmen looking for work. Jobs this year, he says, are harder than ever to get. `` It's more difficult,'' he said, wearing a worn beige sweater against the chill of the morning air in this mountainous capital. `` There's less work and everything is more expensive.'' Hundreds of tradesmen use this spot, within sight of the president's office at the National Palace, to advertise their skills to prospective employers. An electrician sets a light bulb on top of his metal tool box, while a painter drapes brightly colored paint chips over his khaki-colored canvas bag, bulging with the tools of his trade. Others list their varied skills on small pieces of wood. But this morning, there is little demand for their talents. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has entered yet another year of economic crisis, a year of uncertainty as the government embarks on a new, untested and so far unpopular economic program designed to halt the inflationary spiral. `` It will be a very difficult year,'' cautioned <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>, senior economist at the forecasting firm of <ORGANIZATION> Macro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asesoria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economica </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. 1988 may well be a watershed year, said <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> <PERSON> Beltran </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Rio </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Ciemex-Wefa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> forecasting group in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` It is a very crucial year in a sense on the economic front,'' he said. `` We will know if we are going to conquer inflation.'' The answer hinges on the government's risky new program, called the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>, which was introduced late last year in an effort to rein in the worrisome inflation rate. `` The plan has logic and everyone wants to have the pact succeed because if it does n't, we'll be in a mess because inflation is so high,'' said a high-ranking government official in a recent interview. `` We feel we can reduce inflation very quickly without the social costs of having a huge recession,'' said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Overshadowing the program is the July presidential election. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, the nominee of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, is virtually certain to be sworn in as the next president on Dec. 1. But voter unhappiness over his role as a key architect of the government's policy during the nation's 6-year-old economic crisis may cripple his ability to govern. <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> predicts the anti-inflation program will show results in time for the presidential balloting. `` The government will make sure,'' he said, `` that inflation comes down at all costs by the elections. ...'' `` What happens with inflation and growth will help determine what happens with the election,'' he said. Government officials say the program should quickly bring down the inflation rate to 1 percent to 2 percent a month by year's end so that the yearly pace is 65 percent to 75 percent, less than half the record 159.2 percent of 1987. In December, alone, consumer prices soared 14.8 percent, which at the time was the biggest monthly gain since the government began collecting those statistics in 1968. The record was broken again in January, with a 15.5 percent increase recorded in consumer prices. A key part of the program was to have been an indexation plan, slated to go into effect this month to regulate increases in wages and prices. This past week, the government decided to postpone the implementation of that plan until April and instead announced a 3 percent increase in the minimum daily wage and a freeze on regulated prices of such things as gasoline, telephones and electricity. The government also urged private companies to join in the freeze and said the exchange rate for the peso would be held steady in March. `` We are going to reduce the increase in prices according to some guidelines,'' said one government official. Several major stores, showing their support for the inflation fight, already have announced special sales or given cash refunds of the 15 percent sales tax imposed on consumer goods. Moreover, the government has taken additional steps to open the economy to more imported goods, reasoning that foreign competition will over the long run force Mexican manufacturers to produce better, cheaper products. It also sharply devalued the peso currency and promised to cut its deficit spending. Despite the government's confidence in its handiwork, some private analysts remain skeptical. `` I certainly do n't see anything good coming up for the next year and a half,'' said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, financial editor of the English-language <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and a frequent critic of government economic policies. `` They're not going to get inflation down ...'' she said. `` I really do n't think there's much hope of getting it under 200 percent -LRB- in 1988 -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> predicts an inflation rate of 151 percent this year and worries the inflation-fighting program will plunge the economy into a steep recession. Others forecast a mild recession or a no-growth year. Government officials acknowledge the program will brake the economy into a slight downturn in the first half of the year. But they predict a robust rebound by the end of the year for a final growth rate of 2 percent. The economy likely grew at an inflation-adjusted 1 percent in 1987 after a decline of 3.8 percent in the previous year. In the public's mind, the program has gotten off to a poor start. In unveiling the Solidarity Pact in mid-December, the government put into effect a series of hefty price increases on a variety of basic goods and services. Most of the gains outstripped boosts in the minimum daily wage, which now stands at about $ 3.50. `` Everyday we spend more,'' said <PERSON> Gabino </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON>, 62, a plumber waiting for work near the Metropolitan Cathedral. He complained the minimum wage covers `` nothing ... absolutely nothing.'' `` Intended to pull together people from all walks of life into a common front against inflation, the pact is proving an effective rallying point _ practically everybody seems to be against it. Or at least not enthusiastically behind it,'' wrote the weekly magazine <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>. But officials contend the program will overcome its initial unpopularity. `` What would really worry me is not to take them -LRB- the economic measures -RRB-. There's nothing free,'' said one high-ranking official.

<DATELINE>TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For some <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> farmers, sunflowers have become more than a state symbol. Wild sunflowers have always flourished here _ hence <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>' reputation as the <ORGANIZATION> Sunflower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> _ but now, farmers in the northwest and north central part of the state are making money by growing the tall, green and yellow plants for sale to snack-food processing plants `` We're the newest crop in the state, and the fastest-growing,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Featherstone </PERSON>, one of two <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> men who opened the Ag Dynamics sunflower seed processing plant in <LOCATION> Goodland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, in October 1986. The two sought to locate their plant at <LOCATION> Goodland </LOCATION>, a small farming community near the state's border with <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, because its high altitude, low humidity, long growing season and irrigation are perfect for cultivating the high-quality sunflowers used in snack foods, <PERSON> Featherstone </PERSON> said. Although most of the sunflower processing has been done in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, the prime growing area is shifting southward to <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, officials said. According to an informal survey by the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, the total number of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> acres planted in sunflowers increased from about 60,000 acres in 1982 to about 200,000 in 1987. Farmers yield about 2,000 pounds of sunflower seeds an acre. From 1985 to 1987, the number of acres planted in non-oil seeds in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> increased by about 41,000. Sunflower seeds are used to produce oil and bird seed, in addition to snack foods. `` It's not ever going to take over wheat,'' said Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Brownback </PERSON>, `` but it does bring in some money for these people.'' It was n't always that way. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> has been strong in growing basic crops with stable markets, but has lagged behind other states in growing and marketing specialty crops. `` They can grow the stuff but the problem has always been marketing,'' <PERSON> Featherstone </PERSON> said. `` Marketing is more than just taking orders.'' When Ag Dynamics first moved into the <LOCATION> Goodland </LOCATION> area, for example, some farmers were growing sunflowers for use in sunflower oil and bird seed. But growers were reluctant to venture into the snack-food market because they were unfamiliar with the crop and skeptical of its money-making potential. Depressed prices for traditional money-makers, such as corn and wheat, convinced many to take the plunge into the sunflower business. Ag Dynamics helped ease the transition for some by guaranteeing a market their specialty crop. `` We cover his -LRB- the farmer's -RRB- product by selling contracts to roasters on the other end,'' <PERSON> Featherstone </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Brownback </PERSON> cautions that each farmer must decide whether alternative crops such as sunflowers are right for his or her situation. Many established farmers have no incentive to try alternative crops, <PERSON> Brownback </PERSON> said, but smaller farmers with less capital or those with debts receive needed cash when they grow on contract. At the <LOCATION> Goodland </LOCATION> plant, seeds are dehulled, cleaned, sorted and bagged and then shipped out of state to several nut companies, where they are roasted, bagged and distributed, <PERSON> Brownback </PERSON> said. Ag Dynamics sells its sunflower seeds to about 40 nut companies, including Planters. They also export about 25 percent of the crop to other countries, such as <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. For the 1988 crop, they will contract with farmers to grow about 30,000 acres, <PERSON> Featherstone </PERSON> said. Their first year, they contracted for about 350 acres. Improving the field-to-market organization has brightened the future for <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> sunflower growers considerably. Processing plants in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> also are beginning to contract with <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> farmers for the sunflower seeds they use to produce snacks. `` A major portion of the crop is now swinging down into <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Featherstone </PERSON> said. And the quality of the seeds grown in northwest <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> is so good, <PERSON> Brownback </PERSON> said, `` We're getting some people requesting <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> sunflowers.''

 <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nava </PERSON> has a small and prosperous tool business in this bustling provincial city. But like most businessmen throughout <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, he complains that inflation is eating him up. It is chewing up his profits, his capital, and his working money. Worst of all, he says he's even getting used to it. Like most others _ rich and poor _ he is becoming `` confused, losing confidence in the system and I do n't know what lies in store tomorrow.'' <PERSON> Nava </PERSON>'s trials and tribulations are typical of those afflicting business people in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. When the economic crisis hit <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> back in 1982, <PERSON> Nava </PERSON>'s dealership sold mostly electric motors of up to 3 horsepower and mills for grinding `` nixtamal,'' the corn dough out of which tortillas are made Ribbon-saws and other carpentry tools were a sideline. As inflation grew, sales slumped and credit began to dry up, <PERSON> Nava </PERSON> quickly made carpentry tools his main line, which he sold to colonial furniture-makers throughout <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION> state. <PERSON> Nava </PERSON>, 45, a mechanical engineer by profession, got rid of the many salesmen he had on commission, keeping four of the best. He gave them a salary plus commission, but also made them double as drivers, deliverers, bill collectors and service men. He also gave his customers credit, on easy payment terms. `` Not one of them welshed. Some were late with their payments, but overall my collection rate averaged 98 percent, far better than any bank in the state,'' <PERSON> Nava </PERSON> said. `` I'd give them up to 10 months credit, at about 6 percent when the banks were charging more than 11 percent monthly,'' he added. By late October 1987, <PERSON> Nava </PERSON>'s business was thriving. The salesmen alone were earning an average of 600,000 pesos monthly, the equivalent of $ 351, a good wage at the time and about one-quarter more than their rivals were making. But last November, the government suddenly devalued the peso currency from around 1,708 to around 2,025 to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar in order to keep the price of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s exports competitive. <PERSON> Nava </PERSON>'s working capital of 40 million pesos shrank overnight in dollar terms from the equivalent of $ 23,400 to $ 19,700 The devaluation set off another huge round of inflation, so President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON>'s lame-duck administration announced an Economic Solidarity Pact to keep worker's purchasing power _ and sales _ from shrinking even further. The de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> administration has said its main aim is to keep things relatively stable until <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s shoo-in candidate, is elected next July 6 and takes over as president Dec. 1 for a six-year term. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, who was the current president's budget and planning secretary, has promised to `` modernize'' the country, closing or selling hundreds of money-losing state companies, slashing the budget deficit, reducing unnecessary subsidies. `` If <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> accomplishes even half of what he has promised we will all be in good shape. The trouble is that they -LRB- candidates -RRB- have made promises and promises over the years, but have not fulfilled them,'' said <PERSON> Nava </PERSON>. `` So people believe less every day,'' he said, describing himself as neither a supporter of nor an indiscriminate critic of the ruling party. Meanwhile, he complains that in real terms his business is shrinking. `` I have raised interest rates to my clients to 8 percent monthly and reduced payment deadlines to a seven months, maximum,'' he said. `` Even so, we have had to absorb a lot of the added costs -LRB- caused by inflation -RRB-. As a result, he said that, `` while the volume of sales in peso terms has gone up, the number of units sold has dropped.'' Overall his net profits have dropped 10 percent since late October. `` It's psychological to a great degree. Inflation is in part due to a lack of confidence,'' he said.

 The stock market stumbled today after vaulting to a new post-crash high on Monday. The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 blue-chip stocks was down 1.33, or 0.06 percent, to 2,070.29 at noon on Wall Street. Analysts had expected to see the market follow through on Monday's advance, but the move failed to materialize in the early going. Some said the morning's activity was highlighted by big investors cashing in their gains. Stocks losing ground outnumbered gainers by 775 to 602 with 461 issues unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> totaled 103.25 million at noon, off from 133.99 million at the same time Monday when dividend plays on utility stocks ignited an early trading burst. `` It's sort of a pause to take profits and see where we go next,'' observed <PERSON> Eldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimm </PERSON>, senior vice president for Birr, <ORGANIZATION> Wilson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts said traders found little to inspire them in the economic data released this morning. The government said its chief economic forecasting gauge dropped a sharp 0.6 percent in January, but an upward revision for December eased fears of an imminent recession. Also today, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said construction spending tumbled 2.9 percent in January, the biggest decline in 10 months. But as in the case of the leading index, the drop followed a revised 0.4 percent increase in December. Analysts said the figures were in line with expectations and had little impact on trading. Aside from the economic data, market traders were expected to focus on the latest rash of takeover deals, which helped propel Monday's surge. Among the most active stocks on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> gained 1 -RRB- to 67 ~ following <ORGANIZATION> R.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> offer of $ 73.80-per-share for about 80 percent of the company's outstanding shares <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which has been chasing <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> with a bid of $ 68 per share, said <PERSON> Macy </PERSON>'s offer was `` simply not competitive.'' But other results were mixed. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Roebuck </PERSON> was up \ to 38; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> was down \ to 45 \, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> was up 1 to 37 -RCB-, <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s was down -LRB- to 7 -RRB-; and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was up -RRB- to 117 The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks was down 0.51 to 149.95 at mid-day. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index was up 0.65 to 289.11. On Monday, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 48.41 to 2,071.62, reaching its highest point since the October crash. The run left the Dow average 20 points higher than the previous post-crash peak of 2,051.89 on Jan. 7. Analysts noted that while today's early performance was disappointing, the market appeared firm enough to avoid the kind of slide that followed the January advance. The day after hitting that peak, the Dow plunged 140 points.

 <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has suspended payment of interest and principal on subordinated debts totaling $ 155 million. The <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City-based </LOCATION> oil and gas company announced Monday that interest payments on the $ 155 million subordinated debt had become more than the company can handle. Payments on other debt obligations will continue, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, director of investor relations for the company. `` Our business environment has simply come to the point where it is presently not in the best interests of either our shareholders or our subordinated debt holders for us to remain current on our subordinated debt as it is currently structured,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kishpaugh </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer. The first payment suspended was a biannual interest payment of $ 869,000 due Monday on the company's 10 percent Second Delayed Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due Dec. 31, 1993, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> said. Principal on those notes is about $ 32 million, he said. The company has about 11 other issues of subordinated notes, he said. `` The problem is we're not generating enough cash flow from our Egyptian assets'' to be able to handle both current debt and move ahead in the company's exploration plans, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> said.

 The government's chief economic forecasting gauge dropped a sharp 0.6 percent in January, but an upward revision for December eased fears of an imminent recession. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported a month ago that the index had declined 0.2 percent in December after falling in October and November. Three consecutive monthly declines in the index is the traditional, but not infallible, signal of an impending recession. In today's report, however, the December calculation was revised to show an increase of 0.3 percent. Since it was created in 1948, the index has correctly forecast every recession the country has had with declines for at least three consecutive months. Thus, the revision to December was taken by economists as a heartening sign that the country is unlikely to suffer a downturn this year. `` The leading index shows that this is a no-recession year for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` We will have a slower economy but no recession.'' <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> predicted that overall economic growth, as measured by the gross national product, could dip as low as 0.5 percent in the current January-March quarter as factories cut back production to work off a backlog of unsold goods. But he said growth will gradually strengthen as the year progresses, aided by continued strong demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports. `` The economy will have a reasonably good year for an election year, especially in view of the mine field of risks that are around, ranging from the old age of the expansion to the effects of the stock market crash,'' <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> said. In a second report today, the government said construction spending dropped a sharp 2.9 percent in January, the biggest setback in 10 months, as widespread weakness in all categories from housing to non-residential construction and government building posted declines. The leading index has taken on added significance since Oct. 19, when stock prices plunged a record 508 points, eclipsing the 1929 market crash, which preceded the Great Depression. Since October's steep decline, however, a number of business barometers have shown strength, including continued declines in the unemployment rate. Even the stock market has rallied in recent weeks, climbing more than 48 points on Monday to close at its highest level since the October collapse. Economists are looking for the economy to slow in the first half of 1988, but they now believe that the sluggish growth will not worsen into a recession. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economists </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that while more than half of its members responding to a November survey believed the country would suffer a recession this year, that figure had now dropped to about one-fourth. The 0.6 percent January decline was led by a big increase in new claims for unemployment benefits, which averaged 351,000 a week in January, up 12.5 percent from the December level. Since January, however, the weekly unemployment claims figures have been falling, further easing recession fears. In all, five of the nine available indicators showed weakness during January. After unemployment claims, the negative factors were a drop in building permits, a decline in manufacturers' orders for consumer goods, changes in raw materials prices and a drop in business delivery times. Four indicators showed strength during the month, with a rise in stock prices making the biggest gain. Other positive forces were the growth of the money supply, increases in the length of the average workweek and a rise in orders for plant and equipment. The various changes left the index at 190.2 percent of its 1967 base of 100. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> forecasting firm, until recently had been expecting a recession in the early part of 1988. But he said he was now less pessimistic because a variety of business barometers have rebounded after an initial shock from the stock market decline. `` The economy is n't out of the woods yet, but a recession forecast is a diminished probability now,'' he said. The overall economy, as measured by the gross national product, raced ahead at a 4.5 percent rate in the final three months of 1987. But almost all of that increase came from a big buildup of unsold products. Analysts said production will be cut back in the current quarter while those high inventory levels are worked down. Many economists think growth will slow to below 1 percent with some even expecting a negative GNP growth figure from January through March. But economists think growth will then slowly improve, allowing the economy to expand at around 2 percent for all of 1988, about half of the 1987 level. `` Most of the growth in the economy is going to come from exports with consumer spending and home building continuing to be depressed,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Italy's Opposition to 1988 Budget Endangers EEC Reforms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Financial reforms agreed to by leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> two weeks ago appeared threatened Tuesday by <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s refusal to pay its share into the 1988 budget. Sources within the 12-nation Common Market said <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s objections to the budget draft could lead other <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> states to disavow their earlier consent to the reforms `` Once one country begins to question the agreement, all others will want to do the same,'' one official said. The official, who asked to remain anonymous in keeping with established practice, said the problem is likely to be sent to a meeting of <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers to be held March 5 at <LOCATION> Konstanz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` Of course, we are very disappointed that we have to deal with this problem at this stage,'' said a German official who asked not to be named. `` The whole situation endangers the 1988 budget ... everything is blocked,'' he said. The much-heralded reforms, agreed in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> Feb. 13, were designed to rein in the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s skyrocketing farm spending and give the trading bloc a sound financial footing for the next five years. But <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s objections had forced Common Market budget ministers last Wednesday to suspend efforts to adopt the overdue spending plan. In a letter Monday to West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON> <PERSON> Goria </PERSON> rejected the formula as offending `` the principles'' on which the reforms stand. An official message from <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> Tuesday said <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s contribution to the fund was at least $ 143 million higher than agreed at the summit. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which currently holds the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> presidency, gave <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> until noon Tuesday to change its mind. But the deadline passed and the Italian government remained adamant in opposing the new formula for calculating national contributions to a budget supplement set at 7.6 billion European currency units, or $ 8.2 billion. That amount is needed to bridge the gap between anticipated spending needs totaling the equivalent of $ 54.6 billion and revenue available under current EEC rules.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> financier <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurwitz </PERSON> has moved to gain control of <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION>, the world's fifth largest aluminum producer, with an agreement to pay up to $ 230 million for a 32.1 percent voting share. <PERSON> Hurwitz </PERSON>' bid to <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clore </PERSON> competed with a bid by <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>, a Swiss aluminum business owner. <PERSON> Hurwitz </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Clore </PERSON>, has no experience in the aluminum industry. The announcement Monday said the company would have preferred that the British industrialist's' holdings be sold more broadly. <PERSON> Clore </PERSON> was under intense pressure to sell from creditors. If <PERSON> Clore </PERSON> had n't found a buyer by a Monday deadline, he could have faced default on loans he had obtained using <PERSON> Kaiser </PERSON> stock as collateral. After the stock plunged because of the October market crash, lenders wanted repayment. The Oakland-based company's stock rose $ 1.125 a share Monday to close at $ 11.875 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Under the deal, Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> Maxxam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a company controlled by <PERSON> Hurwitz </PERSON>, agreed to buy from <PERSON> Clore </PERSON> and his lenders 6.2 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> stock for $ 12 a share. Once <ORGANIZATION> Maxxam </ORGANIZATION> purchases the stock, it has an option to acquire 8.2 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> convertible preferred stock at $ 13.75 to $ 14 a share. <ORGANIZATION> Maxxam </ORGANIZATION> also must pay $ 8 million to $ 10 million in expenses, the nature of which was undisclosed. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Maxxam </ORGANIZATION> is negotiating agreements with other parties to buy an additional 2.8 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> common stock for $ 12 a share. It was not clear what effect <ORGANIZATION> Maxxam </ORGANIZATION>'s purchase would have immediately on the <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> board. All 14 seats are up for election shortly. Included are eight board members appointed by <PERSON> Clore </PERSON>, including <PERSON> Clore </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kaiser </PERSON>'s chief executive officer. The probable changes in <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION>'s executive suite and boardroom come as the company is rebounding from six straight years of losses. <PERSON> Kaiser </PERSON> has sold its chemicals, oil and gas businesses, has slashed debt, and is concentrating on its core aluminum business.

 <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> has expressed interest in acquiring state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Rover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, the moneylosing automaker that the government previously said it intended to sell.

 <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Konzak </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Devils </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> rummaged through the clutter of his briefcase and found a letter as proof that his invention, a `` pop-up scarecrow,'' has already earned him some attention, if not wealth. `` I am still invited to the <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> show. It is a standing invitation,'' the 66-year-old retired farmer said, answering questions about his scarecrow at the second annual <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inventors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Forty inventors and manufacturers, most of them from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, showed off gizmos, gadgets and thingamajigs at the show that ended Tuesday. Spokesman <PERSON> Scot </PERSON> <PERSON> Nething </PERSON> said only four of them had displayed their wares in last year's show. `` It's a whole new crop.'' The inventions showcased this year ranged from an ultralight airplane manufactured in <LOCATION> Edgeley </LOCATION> to a swinging mailbox that a <LOCATION> Minot </LOCATION> man devised after a neighbor complained about his mailbox getting knocked down by snowplows each winter. And then there was a lawnmower doubling as a fertilizer spreader, a clothes dryer vent closure, a crayon holder, a retractable engine heater cord and a wheel bearing packer. <PERSON> Konzak </PERSON>'s pride and joy stood at one side of his booth on the floor of the Jamestown Civic Center. It was a steel contraption wearing fluorescent work gloves, decked out in red and yellow ribbons and sporting a dummy's head adorned with a cowboy hat. In a sunflower field, the clumsy-looking `` pest-scaring device'' jumps up from among the plants, twirls and whistles to startle blackbirds and keep them from feasting on the seeds, <PERSON> Konzak </PERSON> said Monday. `` All you need is one on 40 acres,'' he said. `` With the buzzer in here and all the stuff, it can pay for itself in one year.'' A battery and propane tank give the scarecrow its life. Since getting his mechanical scarecrow patented in April 1986, <PERSON> Konzak </PERSON> has made about 30 of them and sold them all at about $ 500 apiece, he said. But he said he has n't made any money yet. `` I've just made my expenses. I put $ 20,000 into patenting this thing.'' Business has n't even been that brisk for the ultralight maker, <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Edgeley </LOCATION>, which built its first ultralight airplane a year ago and has sold two so far, sales manager <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> said. A yellow one displayed at the Inventors <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> costs $ 7,450, not including options. `` Ranchers can use them. Retired people. Anybody who likes to fly can use them. It is n't any different than boating, motorcycling and snowmobiling,'' <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> said. Ultralights do n't require pilots' licenses <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cando </LOCATION> displayed his `` Garda-A-Lok,'' which he patented a year ago. It clamps around the outside door handle of motels or apartments, a lock over a lock. `` Nobody gets into that room,'' he said. `` Tonight, there will be one on our motel room when we leave it,'' he said. <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Behrens </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minot </LOCATION> developed his damage-proof mailbox last fall and sold 16 so far at $ 46.90 each. The idea is simple _ a mailbox that swings back into place if a snowplow or other vehicle gets off the side of the road and bashes it. <PERSON> Behrens </PERSON>, who retired after 28 years as an assistant airport manager, came up with the idea after a neighbor complained about how difficult it was replanting an uprooted mailbox when the ground was frozen. <PERSON> Behrens </PERSON> said he provides his own testing laboratory: `` I got my own out by the road, of course, and I give it a bat and a swing to see how it's working.''

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Lower, Gold Prices Up</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar ended mostly lower against major foreign currencies Tuesday after another sluggish trading session in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Gold prices rose. Traders said the dollar came under some mild selling pressure late in the day, possibly because of a slightly worse-than-expected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leading indicators statistic for January. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the index fell 0.6 percent in January, but the decline was partly offset by a revision in the December index to a 0.3 percent rise from a previously announced 0.2 percent fall. Many dealers discounted the dollar's slight decline Tuesday and said the market remains stagnant. The British pound, meanwhile, was boosted by higher interest rates in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>U.S. Trade Figures Send Mixed Message</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Looking at <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade figures for the past year is like looking at a glass of water _ the glass is either half empty or half full, depending on one's perspective. From the Japanese side, the figures show improvement, with exports beginning to decline in volume terms after years of growth that provoked resentment among its trading partners. From the American side, the trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> rose again, mainly because the soaring yen inflated the cost of Japanese imports. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, government officials are optimistic that recent trade statistics show a trend toward reducing <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s huge trade surplus. But independent economists are voicing reservations over long-term trade prospects. Referring to the latest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures, a <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> official said the tide is slowly turning and that, although the figures showed the biggest deficit in history, the imbalance with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> actually decreased. `` It depends on whether you look at trade in yen or dollar terms,'' he said. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s exports rose 5.6 percent in dollar terms but fell 8.2 percent in yen terms in the last three months of 1987, compared to a year earlier. At the same time, imports rose in terms of both dollars and yen. `` As for volume, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s imports are growing, with a big increase from the newly industrialized countries and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, though the increase with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was not so large,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. According to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> figures, the trade deficit last year was a record $ 171.2 billion, up from $ 156.2 billion in 1986. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' largest bilateral deficit again was with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> _ a record $ 59.8 billion, up from $ 58.6 billion in 1986 and $ 49.7 billion in 1985. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Napier </PERSON>, vice president and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> economist with the investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, does see a short-term easing in the trade imbalance, but warns that good figures in the short term may be misleading. `` The first quarter looks good, and we will see a brief lull because Japanese automakers have too much inventory already in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` But I do n't really think the figures for the final quarter of 1987 signal that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus has topped out. There were basically no trends in 1987.'' Barriers keeping <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exporters out of certain Japanese markets, such as highly controversial restrictions on imported beef, citrus fruits and rice, add to the trade imbalance problem and have come under heavy fire from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. But the most pressing question now may not be barriers or exchange rates, <PERSON> Napier </PERSON> said. `` I think that the yen-dollar rate is no longer a problem for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exporters. More marketing focus is needed in this country, which traditionally has not been a target,'' he said. <PERSON> Napier </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> lags behind <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the newly industrialized countries in expanding exports to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> because of a lack of distribution facilities, an insufficient sales force and scanty product representation. `` It was interesting to hear that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Steel would be exporting again, but that they chose <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as their market,'' he said. The official at the Japanese trade ministry agreed. `` Success depends on exporters' efforts,'' he said. `` Exporters in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> now have the chance to compete. Japanese consumers are changing and there are more and more foreign products for sale in supermarkets here. `` Domestic demand for foreign goods is increasing, so now is the time for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> to try to expand in the Japanese market. Exporters should act immediately to take advantage of developments here,'' he added. `` As for the future prospects of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, I think that with the yen-dollar rate our imports will continue to steadily increase.'' <PERSON> Napier </PERSON> also offers some comfort to Americans wondering if the trade imbalance with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will ever end. `` The marketing focus is starting to change, with more attention being given to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` It may take awhile, but this will eventually have an impact.''

<HEAD>Pittsburg &amp; Midway To Buy New Mexico Mines In $97.7 Million
Agreement</HEAD>

 A federal bankruptcy judge has approved the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Kaiser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s two northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> coal mines to <LOCATION> Pittsburg </LOCATION> & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Midway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 97.7 million, a company official said. But the deal's consummation hinges on the resolution of a dispute over a coal delivery contract with <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s Salt River Project, said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Meurer </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Midway manager of public affairs, on Tuesday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheson </PERSON> on Monday approved <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Midway's purchase of the <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Complex </ORGANIZATION> _ two coal mines 35 miles west of <LOCATION> Raton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION> _ for $ 88.1 million in cash and the assumption of $ 9.6 million in <LOCATION> Kaiser </LOCATION>'s liabilities, said <PERSON> Meurer </PERSON>. `` We're gratified at the ruling, and we'd like to close on the deal as soon as possible,'' <PERSON> Meurer </PERSON> said. The bankruptcy judge's ruling was required because <ORGANIZATION> Kaiser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and its parent company, <ORGANIZATION> Kaiser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, have been operating under Chapter 11 reorganization since February 1987, said <PERSON> Meurer </PERSON>. But he said that part of the agreement calls for his company's assumption of <PERSON> Kaiser </PERSON>'s 25-year agreement to supply 475,000 tons of coal per year from the <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> mines to the Salt River Project _ while the <ORGANIZATION> Salt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> is trying to end the agreement through a petition to the bankruptcy court `` Prior to closure of this sale, this litigation must be favorably resolved,'' said <PERSON> Meurer </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Matheson </PERSON> was scheduled to hear arguments March 22 and 23. When the deal is made final, <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Midway, a <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, will gain control of a surface mine and an underground mine that together employ 275 hourly employees and 75 salaried workers, said <PERSON> Meurer </PERSON>. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Midway has been managing the mines since January and laid off 74 employees on Feb. 22. The mines produced 1.75 million tons of coal last year, <PERSON> Meurer </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Archer </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a major processor of raw agricultural commodities, has signed a letter of intent to buy <ORGANIZATION> CLC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis-based </LOCATION> barge line, the companies have announced. The barge company emerged in December from a complex Chapter 11 bankruptcy, during which it fended off several buy-out offers. <ORGANIZATION> ADM </ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay about $ 60 million in common stock for the company in a transaction to be completed by June, company officials said.

 The stock market crept ahead today after vaulting to a new post-crash high Monday. The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 blue-chip stocks recovered from a small loss earlier in the day to stand at 2,071.95, up 0.33, or 0.02 percent, at 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Analysts had expected to see the market follow through on Monday's strong advance, but the trend was mostly disappointing with two hours of trading to go. Some said the morning's activity was highlighted by big investors cashing in their gains. Stocks losing ground outnumbered gainers by 802 to 688 with 424 issues unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> totaled 147.54 million at 2 p.m., well behind the levels reached at the same time Monday when dividend plays on utility stocks ignited an early trading burst. `` It's sort of a pause to take profits and see where we go next,'' observed <PERSON> Eldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimm </PERSON>, senior vice president for Birr, <ORGANIZATION> Wilson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts said traders found little to inspire them in the economic data released this morning. The government said its chief economic forecasting gauge dropped a sharp 0.6 percent in January, but an upward revision for December eased fears of an imminent recession. Also today, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said construction spending tumbled 2.9 percent in January, the biggest decline in 10 months. But like the leading index, the drop followed a revised 0.4 percent increase in December. Analysts said the figures were in line with expectations and had little impact on trading. Aside from the economic data, traders focused on issues swept up in the latest rash of takeover deals, which had powered Monday's surge Among the most active stocks on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> gained 1 -LRB- to 67 | following <ORGANIZATION> R.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> offer of $ 73.80-per-share for about 80 percent of the company's outstanding shares <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which received a sweetened buyout offer from its top management, dipped -LRB- to 49 ~ Other results were similarly mixed. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Roebuck </PERSON> was up \ to 38; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> was down -RRB- to 45 -LRB-, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> was up 1 \ to 38, <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s was down -LRB- to 7 -RRB-; and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was up -LRB- to 117 The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks was down 0.46 to 150.00.

 Senior officials from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> on Tuesday ordered <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION> to try to reach an agreement on industrial and commercial cooperation with <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> by mid-1988. The decision emerged at the end of a one-day meeting of transport ministers and chief executives of the industrial partners in the European commercial aircraft group. Aviation industry observers said it was the latest display of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s eagerness to penetrate the lucrative <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market while trying to reduce trade friction over American claims of unfair competition by <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION>. Trade negotiators from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the four <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> partner-countries are scheduled to meet in <LOCATION> Konstanz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, March 18 to discuss <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> claims that the Europeans unfairly subsidize the consortium. French Transport Minister <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Douffiagues </PERSON> told reporters after the ministers' meeting that <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION>' mandate is `` unlimited,'' although the negotiations would tend to focus more on planned aircraft than on existing programs. A cooperation accord with <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> could take the form of a joint venture or co-production scheme, he said. <PERSON> Douffiagues </PERSON> suggested that possible areas of useful cooperation between <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Mcdonnell </PERSON> could include small short-range jets with between 100-150 seats as well as large aircraft with 350 seats or more.'' There is no upper limit,'' he said'' Any agreement with <PERSON> Mcdonnell </PERSON> must be balanced, taking account of the advantages and constraints for both sides,'' <PERSON> Douffiagues </PERSON> said <PERSON> Douffiagues </PERSON> said part of the interest in an agreement is that it would ease <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION>'s access to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market, where the group has only three customers. A statement released after the meeting said <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION>' mandate is to negotiate `` diligently'' and `` with a will to reaching a balanced agreement that is beneficial to the two parties.'' The industrial partners of the <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> consortium _ <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Aerospatiale </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Aerospace, <ORGANIZATION> Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Construcciones </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aeronauticas </LOCATION> _ have had contacts with <PERSON> Mcdonnell </PERSON> for almost two years now on eventual cooperation Previous talks with <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> on possible cooperation collapsed in 1986.

 A management group led by <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman has raised its bid for the company to $ 1.4 billion, and the board of directors agreed to submit the offer to shareholders `` without endorsement,'' <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday The deal, now valued at $ 1.4 billion, would provide $ 46 in cash and junior securities with a face value of $ 6.50 for each share. In December, the group led by Chairman <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heyman </PERSON> had offered $ 1.35 billion, or $ 40 in cash and $ 8.50 in securities per share. That represented a downward revision from its $ 2.3 billion first offer, made in September, of $ 64 in cash and $ 2.50 face value in debt securities. <PERSON> Heyman </PERSON> said rising interest rates made it impossible for the group to continue the original bid. A special committee of the board of the specialty chemicals and building materials company has agreed to submit the new proposal `` without endorsement'' to shareholders, <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> said. To permit that, shareholders must first vote on an amendment to the company charter. The amendment would allow shareholders to act in place of the board in considering a merger offer, as the Heyman-led proposal has been presented. The committee had earlier rejected the $ 64-a-share proposal as being inadequate. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> said it had decided to let stockholders decide based on the favorable opinion of the offer by <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, retained by the committee as financial advisers. The decision was also made following the committee's instructions to <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> to solicit other possible purchasers, <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> said The committee said that if it receives an `` economically superior alternative proposal'' for <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>, it could cancel its agreement with the buyout group. `` We think the price is a fare and full price,'' <PERSON> Heyman </PERSON> said. `` It's seven times the price of the stock only four years ago.'' <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> stock, which reached a low of $ 31.50 after the Oct. 19 stock market crash, has traded around $ 50 with speculation about an agreement. It was $ 49.75, down 25 cents, on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in afternoon trading Tuesday. The agreement will put the management offer `` to the test of the marketplace,'' said <PERSON> Heyman </PERSON>, who wrested control of <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 after a bitter proxy fight to oust former Chairman <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Werner </PERSON>. During his tenure, <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> has made hundreds of millions of dollars in unsuccessful buyout attempts of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Borg-Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` We're primarily an operating company, but we're not retiring from the takeover arena,'' the 48-year-old executive said Tuesday. <PERSON> Heyman </PERSON> owns 2.8 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>, or about 10 percent of its outstanding stock. He said the takeover would be financed by loans from a bank syndicate led by <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION>, a limited debt offering and the group's own money. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> also said it had reached tentative settlements of lawsuits brought in connection with the buyout offer.

The company will construct a 2 -LCB- - mile pipeline that will transport waste water from the plant to <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>'s on-site water treatment plant, assistant plant manager <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Schenk </PERSON> said Construction is expected to be completed in 1991. In addition, three water basins and about six miles of unlined ditches on the 1,600-acre site will be cleaned up and no longer used to store waste water, <PERSON> Schenk </PERSON> said. The company makes about 750 chemical products at the facility in the Deepwater section of this <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> community. The waste water is generated by the manufacture of those products. The plant is also the state's largest commercial hazardous waste disposal facility and one of three existing industrial facilities seeking state approval to build an incinerator to burn hazardous wastes generated elsewhere in the state.

 <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, enjoying higher oil prices in 1987, reported a return to profitability. The former <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, now a segment of <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. PLC, earned $ 564 million in 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> incurred a $ 188 million loss in 1986, its final full year not under <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION>'s control. Due to tax accounting requirements of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> could not report fourth-quarter net earnings, spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Andes </PERSON> said Tuesday. The company's results were released Monday. Income from operations in the fourth quarter was $ 613 million, compared with $ 109 million in <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>'s fourth quarter of 1986. In all of 1987, operating income totaled $ 2.26 billion, compared with an operating loss of $ 242 million in 1986. The 1986 annual loss included $ 1.13 billion for writedowns and restructuring charges. Operating income reflects what <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> contributed to its parent company's results. Operating income does not include regular tax charges or interest payments on debt. The report was the first release of financial results by BP <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> since June, when <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> bought the 45 percent of common stock of <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> that it did not already own. BP America sales were $ 15.4 billion, compared with $ 13.9 billion in 1986. For the fourth quarter, sales were $ 4.01 billion, up from $ 3.35 billion for the year-ago period. `` As these results show, <LOCATION> BP </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s performance is highly dependent on crude oil prices,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, chief executive officer of the company. `` In 1987, higher crude oil prices, lower costs and increased production have significantly improved the contribution made by the exploration and production segment,'' he continued. `` We also benefited from the resumption of activity at the <LOCATION> Bingham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION> mine -LRB- in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> -RRB- at a time of higher copper prices.''

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> court on Tuesday approved <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belgique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION>'s issuance of 12 million new shares in a ruling that could intensify the battle for control of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s biggest holding company. <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> announced in January it was raising its capital to 40.2 million shares from 28.2 million shares, shortly after Italian investor <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> indicated he wanted to gain control of the company. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> raised questions about the new capital issue in court, and the courts stripped the shares of voting rights in two previous decisions. Tuesday's ruling would retore voting rights for those shares temporarily and if approved by a higher court, the issue would dilute the stake of all shareholders. Belgian industrialist <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Leysen </PERSON>, who is aligned with <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>, said he has an option on 10 million of the 12 million new shares. But the management of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>, which opposes <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benedetti </ORGANIZATION>'s bid, has said the option is no longer valid because <PERSON> Leysen </PERSON> failed to form an alliance in support of <LOCATION> Societe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Generale </LOCATION> early last month. <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Etienne </PERSON> <PERSON> Davignon </PERSON> said the new shares are owned by seven companies from <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> that have formed an alliance which is siding with the 166-year-old company. The alliance claims to hold 52 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>'s original 28.2 million shares <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> has claimed he and his allies control 47.2 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>'s shares, but <PERSON> Davignon </PERSON> said it was only 43 percent. If a higher court confirms the capital increase, <PERSON> Davignon </PERSON> said it would reduce <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>'s stake to about 28.5 percent. Meanwhile, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> said in a statement from <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> he intends to call a shareholders meeting to decide the future of the company after its public offer to buy more <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> shares ends March 4. A source close to <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> said `` we are fully confident we will have a majority of shares at the meeting.'' <PERSON> Leysen </PERSON>'s holding company <ORGANIZATION> Gevaert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> N.V </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement it was `` now in a position'' to buy the new shares as it had agreed to do on Feb. 3. The shares were initially placed with a <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary but have since been sold to the seven companies allied with it, <PERSON> Davignon </PERSON> said. The top official of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamy </PERSON>, said last week the agreement with <PERSON> Leysen </PERSON> was no longer valid `` since <PERSON> Leysen </PERSON> has failed to cement a Belgian federation'' in support of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Leysen </PERSON> could not get a deal with several Belgian and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> groups to keep the company anchored in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> earlier this month. Instead, he reached a partnership agreement with <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> and the Copeba holding company, the Belgian subsidiary of the French <ORGANIZATION> Paribas </ORGANIZATION> group. Together they founded a new holding company called Europa 92. The management of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> first announced the capital increase Jan. 18, just after <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> said he wanted to take control and turn it into a holding company with interests across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> has interests in about 1,400 companies worldwide and in about half of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s top 50 companies. It has an important stake in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s gas, electricity and petroleum sector and in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s largest bank.

 An additional 500,000 metric tons of subsidized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat has been sold to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. The sale, equal to about 18.3 million bushels, was handled by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 100,000 tons; <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 375,000 tons; and <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 25,000 tons. At recent prices averaging $ 2.75 per bushel, the wheat would have a farm value of about $ 50 million. More than 6.8 million tons of subsidized wheat has been sold to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under the department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP, for delivery in the year that began last Oct. 1. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pope </PERSON>, acting general sales manager for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said that only 200 tons of wheat are still available to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under current <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> authorization. There has been no official indication that a new line of subsidy may be approved. Under <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, private exporters are given surplus commodities owned by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> so they can sell a foreign buyer wheat or other authorized commodity at competitive world prices. <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> said the subsidies, or bonuses, averaged $ 27 per ton on the latest sales, or about 74 cents per bushel. The subsidies for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have been available only for wheat. The sales also are part of the grain the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is committed to buy during the fifth and final year of a long-term agreement, which calls for the annual purchase of at least 9 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain. The pact expires Sept. 30. According to the agreement, the annual purchases include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. The Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as two tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain equivalent. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans, or 39.4 bushels of corn. In addition, 2.62 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn, 813,300 tons of soybeans and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal have been bought by the Soviets for delivery this year.

 The stock market finished lower today after fighting to hold the gains that propelled it to a post-crash high Monday. Analysts had expected to see the market follow through on Monday's strong advance, but the trend was mostly disappointing. Some said the day's activity was highlighted by big investors cashing in their gains. `` It's sort of a pause to take profits and see where we go next,'' observed <PERSON> Eldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimm </PERSON>, senior vice president for Birr, <ORGANIZATION> Wilson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. Traders found little evidence in the government's latest batch of statistics to satisfy their curiosity about the health of the economy. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said its chief economic forecasting gauge dropped a sharp 0.6 percent in January, but December's Index of Leading Economic Indicators was revised upward, easing fears of an imminent recession. Also today, the government said construction spending tumbled 2.9 percent in January, the biggest decline in 10 months. But as was the case with the leading index, the drop followed a revised 0.4 percent increase in December. Because the figures were inconclusive, they had little impact on trading, analysts said. Aside from the economic data, traders focused on issues swept up in the latest rash of takeover deals, which had powered Monday's surge

According to <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacion </ORGANIZATION>, a government-owned and - operated daily published in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, the bombs represented `` a new extremist plot against the head of state's life.

 The dollar fell marginally against most key currencies Tuesday, reflecting what dealers called a narrow trading range that has emerged over the past several days. Gold prices rose overseas but were mixed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. As of 4 p.m. EST, <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted gold at $ 430.45 a troy ounce, down 15 cents from the price late Monday. Currency dealers said there was little news to influence the behavior of the dollar. They said a <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report on the index of leading indicators, an important economic barometer, failed to convey a definite trend. The department said the index fell 0.6 percent in January but it revised the December figure from a 0.2 percent drop to a 0.3 percent increase. That revision snapped a string of three straight monthly declines, which has often signaled an impending recession. `` We need something more specific to set the market one way or another,'' said <PERSON> Zlatko </PERSON> <PERSON> Glamuzina </PERSON>, chief currency dealer at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> branch of the Italian bank <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> di </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sicilia </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsch </PERSON>, senior money market economist at <ORGANIZATION> LNS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said `` there appears to be very little impetus for traders to move out of the dollar's range, at least in the near term.'' By contrast, he said, currencies such as the British pound and Canadian dollar seemed to be appreciating because of relatively high interest rates in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. `` We're seeing a lot of deflation in commodity markets and weakness in gold prices, which supports the idea that global interest rates will be steady to lower,'' <PERSON> Dorsch </PERSON> said. `` So international money managers are searching for higher yields.'' The dollar rose in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, closing at 128.63 Japanese yen, up from the Monday close of 128.12 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar was lower at 128.30 yen.

The British pound rose to $ 1.7775 from $ 1.7725 Monday on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market. Later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, sterling was quoted at $ 1.7766, more than the $ 1.7742 quoted late Monday.

The company said it had begun talks with unidentified third parties regarding the possible sale of debt securities as a means of increasing the cash part of the recapitalization, which would pay shareholders $ 1.9 billion plus give them a stake in the recapitalized company. A recapitalization, in which a company restructures its amount of debt and equity, is used often to thwart unwelcome takeovers. The strategy usually plunges a company into debt, making it less attractive as an acquisition. Under the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> recapitalization plan, which would raise the company's long-term debt from $ 412 million to $ 2.3 billion, stockholders would receive $ 59 in cash, $ 5 worth of high-yielding debt securities and one new share of stock in the recapitalized company for each share of old stock. The company's announcement Tuesday did not elaborate on how much it intended to raise the cash portion of the recapitalization but said there was no assurance that any change would be made in the existing proposal.

 The stock market slipped off its post-crash peak Tuesday but showed enough spunk to hold most of its recent gains. The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 stocks bounced off its lows late in the day, closing down 1.16 points, or a scant 0.06 percent, at 2,070.46. With an hour to go, the blue-chip average had been down more than 13 points, but traders took the opportunity to buy stocks, pushing the Dow near Monday's close of 2,071.62, its high-water mark since the Oct. 19 collapse. Stocks declining in price outpaced gainers by 7 to 6 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 811 issues declining, 696 gaining and 457 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume totaled 199.99 million shares, against 236.05 million in the previous session. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index dipped 0.28 to 150.18. The market's lackluster numbers belied its resilience, some analysts said. They noted that the market's previous post-crash high, reached on Jan. 7, was followed the next day by a drop of more than 140 points. The relative firmness of prices Tuesday suggested to some that the market had finally found its sealegs. `` The market had every reason to go down and it did n't,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, a technical analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Traders are no longer afraid of a crash; they're afraid of missing a buying opportunity,'' said <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>. Others were not so sure. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Johson </PERSON>, chief investment officer for <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, characterized the market as `` almost lifeless,'' adding that uncertainty about the economy was still a drag on trading. A batch of government statistics released Tuesday failed to satisfy the market's curiosity about the economy's health. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said its chief economic forecasting gauge dropped a sharp 0.6 percent in January, but the December reading for the Index of Leading Economic Indicators was revised from a 0.2 percent drop to a 0.3 percent gain. The government also said construction spending tumbled 2.9 percent in January, the biggest decline in 10 months. But as was the case with the leading index, the drop followed a revised 0.4 percent increase in December. `` It was a little frustrating,'' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. `` We had hoped to resolve some of the uncertainty -LRB- about the economy -RRB- and we did n't.'' `` The only conclusion is ... we'll miss a recession -LRB- in 1988 -RRB-, but not by much,'' he said. Aside from the economic data, issues swept up in the latest rash of takeover deals dominated interest as they had Monday when the Dow jumped more than 48 points. Among the most active stocks on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> gained 1 \ to a new high of 67 -RCB- following <ORGANIZATION> R.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> offer of $ 73.80 a share for about 80 percent of the company's outstanding shares <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stevens </ORGANIZATION>, which received a revised buyout offer from a management group and said other parties had expressed interest in the company, jumped 6 \ to 54 -LCB-, also a new high Other results were mixed. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Roebuck </PERSON> was up -LCB- to 38 \; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> was down -LCB- to 45; <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> rose \ to 37; <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> rose ~ to 21 -RRB-; <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Richfield </LOCATION> dropped ~ to 76; and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was down -LCB- to 117 Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 230.18 million shares. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's index of 400 industrials dropped 0.62 to 308.81, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was down 0.60 to 267.22.

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Prices Slip Amid USDA Auction Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Wheat futures prices slipped substantially lower Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> launched a new series of auctions aimed at reducing government stockpiles of surplus wheat. On other markets, other grains and soybeans ended mostly lower; energy futures retreated; most livestock and meat futures advanced; precious metals were mixed; and stock-index futures were higher.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s weekly auctions of suplus wheat, begun in November, have gradually lost steam. So on Tuesday the agency launched a new series of sales to be held three times a week. The agency has set targets of 10 million bushels for each of the new auctions during the first two weeks, which creates the potential for adding 30 million bushels a week to the open market. The old weekly auctions usually had targets of 25 million bushels. Sales in recent weeks had fallen well short of that goal, however, with less than 16 million bushels sold last Friday. Traders fear the new auctions, which divide the sales by regions of the country, will be more successful and depress cash prices by adding to available supplies of wheat, analysts said. `` The possibility of selling 10 milllion bushels the first time out is probably going to be a little tough,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON> of Chicago-based G.H. <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` But it's the fact that they're coming right back tomorrow, then on Friday again, that has the market a little on edge. However, analyst <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinton </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Agri-Visor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, said the new auctions probably would have little long-term impact on futures prices. <PERSON> Quinton </PERSON> attributed Tuesday's wheat losses of up to 5 cents a bushel to profit-taking by speculators. Results from Tuesday's auction will likely be released on Wednesday. Wheat settled 4 -LCB- cents to 5 cents lower with the contract for delivery in March at $ 3.11 a bushel; corn was unchanged to -RCB- cent lower with March at $ 2.03 -RCB- a bushel; oats were unchanged to -LCB- cent higher with March at $ 1.94 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent lower to 1 -LCB- cents higher with March at $ 6.35 a bushel. Energy futures prices, particularly for refined products, fell sharply on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where analysts said bulls and bears have been waging a technical tug-of-war. `` This market seems to be moving briskly within a range, which is what it probably will continue to do before it decides which way it wants to go,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. West Texas Intermediate crude oil traded as much as .46 cent lower, but settled .11 cent to .29 cent lower with April at $ 15.72 a barrel; heating oil was .82 cent to 1.15 cents lower with April at 43.47 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .93 cent to 1.10 cents lower with April at 45.29 cents a gallon Livestock and meat futures settled mostly higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Cattle futures moved higher in mostly technical trading, analysts said. Hog futures advanced on bargain buying after Monday's sharp decline, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Linnco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Live cattle were unchanged to .52 cent higher with April at 71.95 a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .85 cent higher with March at 80.42 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to .40 cent higher with April at 43.47 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were unchanged to .42 cent lower with March at 51.60 cents a pound. Gold moved slightly higher while silver futures retreated a bit on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Gold for April delivery sank to $ 425 a troy ounce during the session, but rebounded to settle at $ 432.40. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, vice president of Elders' precious metals divison, noted that gold had touched $ 425 on Monday as well, and predicted it would bounce off that level once more before falling to $ 400 a troy ounce in the next three or four weeks. Silver drifted lower in featureless trading, he said. Gold settled 50 cents to 60 cents higher with April at $ 432.40 a troy ounce; silver was 1.7 cents to 2 cents lower with March at $ 6.222 a troy ounce. Stock-index futures inched higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for March delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index setttled .35 point higher at 267.65. The underlying spot index was .59 point lower at 267.23.

<HEAD>Government Reports Paint Confusing Picture Of Economy's Health</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Government reports Tuesday painted a confusing picture about the health of the economy and led to indecision in the financial markets. The government said its chief barometer of future economic activity fell again in January, although an upward revision in December eased fears that the nation was headed for a recession. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 1.16 points to 2,070.46. It was equally quiet in the bond market, where the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s bellwether 30-year bond fell a slim -LRB- point. The dollar was narrowly mixed. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Index of Leading Economic Indicators dropped 0.6 percent in January. Analysts discounted the sharp decline and instead focused on a revision that changed the index's showing in December from a 0.2 percent decline to a 0.3 percent increase The leading index has taken on added importance since last Oct. 19, when stock prices plunged a record 508 points, eclipsing the 1929 market crash that preceded the Great Depression. The upward revision for December broke a string of three consecutive monthly declines, which has often in the past been the signal of an impending recession. The index had fallen 0.1 percent in October and 1.1 percent in November. Separately, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said construction spending fell 2.9 percent in January, the biggest decline in 10 months, reflecting widespread weakness in all sectors of the building industry. Economists said the decline was bigger than expected and will likely mean that construction will be a drag on overall economic growth in the first quarter of 1988. `` What was surprising about the figures was how widespread and pervasive the weakness was. Virtually every category from housing to industrial to hotels and motels did poorly in January,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Economists said the December revision in the leading index and other positive signs provided evidence that the country is suffering few adverse effects from the market turmoil <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> said it showed that `` this is a no-recession year for the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. economy.'' Since it was created in 1948, the leading index has fallen three or more months during an expansion on 12 different occasions. On eight of those instances, a recession did follow. But four times the index gave a false signal of a downturn and the recovery kept going, although at a slower pace. Analysts said the index is indeed sending a signal of slower growth for the first half of 1988, but they predicted that rising export sales would be enough to offset expected weakness in consumer spending and construction. The economy, as measured by the gross national product, raced ahead at a 4.5 percent rate in the final three months of 1987, but the bulk of that increase came from a buildup of unsold products. Economists predict that production cutbacks will slash growth to a rate of 1 percent or less in the first three months of the year. For 1988 as a whole, many economists are forecasting growth of around 2 percent, just about half the 3.9 percent GNP increase registered last year. Analysts said various business barometers have eased their fears of an end to the current recovery. `` Industrial production and export sales are still rising, orders and employment continue to grow and the stock market is regaining its balance,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahn </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. `` Absent any policy blunders by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, I anticipate a strong second half.''

Analysts said the index is indeed sending a signal of slower growth for the first half of 1988, but they predicted that rising export sales would be enough to offset expected weakness in consumer spending and construction. The stock market, which closed Monday at its highest level since the Oct. 19 collapse, edged down a bit Wednesday, with the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average dipping 1.16 points to 2,070.46. Analysts said the signal from the leading index that the country would escape a recession this year was not forceful enough to prompt another wave of buying. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON>, the president's chief economic adviser, said he believed the three declines in the leading index in the past four months was accurately signaling slower but continued growth in the economy. `` The good news is that there is no series of three running'' declines, which could mean a recession, he said in answer to questions. He noted that the administration's own economic forecast calls for slower growth this year. In one indication that the economy has slowed, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said in a second report Tuesday that construction spending fell a steep 2.9 percent in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 395.2 billion. It was the biggest drop in 10 months and reflected widespread weakness in all categories of construction. The economy, as measured by the gross national product, raced ahead at a 4.5 percent rate in the final three months of 1987, but the bulk of that increase came from a buildup of unsold products. Economists predict that production cutbacks will slash growth to a rate of 1 percent or less in the first three months of the year. For 1988 as a whole, many economists are forecasting growth of around 2 percent, just about half the 3.9 percent GNP increase registered last year. But where half of the country's business economists in November were predicting a recession in 1988, that figure has now declined to 25 percent, according to the latest survey of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economists </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts said various business barometers have eased their fears of an end to the current recovery. `` Industrial production and export sales are still rising, orders and employment continue to grow and the stock market is regaining its balance,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahn </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. `` Absent any policy blunders by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, I anticipate a strong second half.'' Three-fourths of the decline in the January leading index came from a big jump in new claims for unemployment benefits, which averaged 351,000 a week in January, an increase of 39,000 weekly claims from December. Since January, however, weekly unemployment claims have been falling, further easing recession fears. In all, five of the nine available indicators showed weakness during January. After unemployment claims, the biggest negative factors were a drop in building permits, a decline in manufacturers' orders for consumer goods, changes in raw materials prices and changes in business delivery times. Four indicators showed strength during the month, with a rise in stock prices making the biggest gain. Other positive forces were the growth of the money supply, increases in the length of the average workweek and a rise in orders for plant and equipment. The various changes left the index at 190.2 percent of its 1967 base of 100. Many analysts predicted that the January decline in the leading index would be followed by significant advance in the leading index for February, based on already known information about the economy.

<HEAD>Pillsbury CEO Says Company Plans To Keep Burger King</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAPLES, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spoor </PERSON>, returning as chief executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday the company has no intention of selling its Burger King subsidiary despite the chain's flat performance in recent months. <PERSON> Spoor </PERSON>, named Monday to replace <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer, also announced several management changes at the Minneapolis-based parent company On Wall Street, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> stock rose 25 cents a share to $ 37 in trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Burger King, which generates 40 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s sales, reportedly has seen its share of the hamburger chain market fall in recent months after rapid growth in the mid-1980s. <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s share fell to about 16.8 percent in early 1987 from a 1986 high of 17.4 percent, The Wall Street Journal reported in December. The company has said its average sales per store have been flat at about $ 1 million for the past two years. `` I want to say without qualification that <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> is central to <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Spoor </PERSON> said in a statement at the conclusion of a two-day meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors. `` That was true yesterday, it is true today, and it remains true for the company's strategic future,'' he said. <PERSON> Spoor </PERSON>'s statement made no mention of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s other restaurant businesses _ <ORGANIZATION> Steak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ale, Godfather's and <PERSON> Bennigan </PERSON>'s _ and a spokesman said neither he nor <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON> was available for comment Tuesday afternoon. <PERSON> Spoor </PERSON> had retired from <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> in 1985, but remained on the company's board of directors. His return as CEO was announced Monday in a statement that gave no reasons for <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>'s resignation `` I pledge to take whatever steps are necessary in the next three months so that we will enter fiscal 1989 with momentum and a solid portfolio of businesses capable of returning superior shareholder value,'' <PERSON> Spoor </PERSON> said in his statement. `` We have a clear strategy that will lead us successfully into the 1990s. fiscal 1988 is a disappointment in many ways, but our future is bright and fiscal 1989, which begins June 1, will be an excellent year and gratifying to our shareholders.'' <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> in fiscal 1987 reported its first earnings decline in 16 years: $ 182 million, or $ 2.10 a share, down from $ 208 million, or $ 2.38 a share, in fiscal 1986. Stock analysts who were projecting fiscal 1988 earnings of about $ 2.80 a share were told by <LOCATION> Stafford </LOCATION> in February to lower the projections by about 30 cents a share, a <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. <PERSON> Spoor </PERSON> on Tuesday announced four promotions in the top management of the company: _ <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, was elected a <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> executive vice president and was named chairman, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Foods He was formerly a <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> vice president and president, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>. _ <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> McBurney </PERSON>, executive vice president, was named chairman, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> McBurney </PERSON> served previously as chairman, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>. _ <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, executive vice president, corporate development and chairman of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haagen-Dazs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, was given the additional responsibility for <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s Industrial Foods Business Industrial Foods was previously a part of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Foods. _ <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Behnke </PERSON>, senior vice president for technology, was made responsible for <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s research and development activities worldwide

 A walkout by 9,000 movie and television script writers seemed likely Tuesday as last-ditch contract talks ended with major issues unresolved and the union saying the producers' last offer appeared designed `` to force a strike.'' Negotiators for the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> met for just two hours before calling it quits Tuesday afternoon. The brief meeting followed a marathon, 21-hour session that lasted until 7:15 a.m. Tuesday and made progress on `` 25 to 30 lesser issues,'' said <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, spokesman for the producers. But the two sides remained far apart on the three major stumbling blocks _ a `` creative rights'' issue that would give original writers more control over the product, higher residual payments when programs are distributed in foreign markets, and a revision of residuals for domestic syndication in the stagnant market for one-hour programs. Both <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> and union spokeswoman <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> confirmed there was no significant movement on those issues in the afternoon session. `` It -LRB- the producers' final offer -RRB- appears to be a company-generated package designed to force a strike,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said. She said the union will study the proposal but declined to say if union leaders would recommend that it be rejected until it is presented to members. The union's 6,500 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> members were to vote Tuesday night on the latest proposal from management, while the 2,500 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> members are to vote Wednesday afternoon. Results from both votes are to be released Wednesday evening, and a strike could come as early as Thursday if the producers' offer is rejected The union's old contract expired at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday. First to feel the impact of a walkout would be daily daytime TV programs and talk shows that have a short lead time for scripts. The effects on prime-time programs and feature films would n't be visible unless a strike was protracted. For producers, the key issue has been obtaining relief on the payment of residuals for syndication of one-hour television programs. The market for such programs has dried up significantly, producers say. They are asking the writers to adopt a revised residual plan similar to one already approved by directors. Under that plan, writers would 50 percent of the normal residuals if a program is put out in only limited syndication. If it is later put out in full national syndication, they get another 100 percent, making it possible for them to receive 150 percent of their normal payments. On the creative-rights issue, the union is seeking to get original writers the power to do the first rewrite of any material, plus the right to be on the set when the program is produced. The producers say such issues must be negotiated individually. On foreign residuals, the union claims writers have n't had a change in their payment schedule in 17 years. That schedule now is based on a single lump sum payment and varies widely based on individual negotiations. The entertainment arm of the writers' union, which has a reputation as one of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s most militant, last went on strike three years ago. That walkout lasted for two weeks before writers voted to accept essentially the same terms they had rejected earlier. The median annual income for writers is $ 40,000, but about half of the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION>'s members are unemployed at any given time, the union says.

<HEAD>Traders' Group Demands Slower Korean Currency Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A major foreign trade group asked the government Wednesday to slow the South Korean currency's appreciation against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar In a report to the government, the <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said the recent sharp rise of the won against the dollar could lead to a series of collapses among exporting firms. A stronger won _ and conversely, a weaker dollar _ raises the costs of Korean products in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a major export market. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been pressuring <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to revalue its currency at a faster pace to help reduce the nation's growing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade surplus, which soared to $ 9.5 billion last year. The association said if the won's value rises 10 percent against the dollar, the average export profitability of South Korean-made products would fall by 3.7 percent. The won has appreciated by 4.13 percent against the dollar so far this year, accounting for about half the range registered for all of 1987. As of Wednesday, the won was quoted at 760.90 to the dollar, down 31.30 won from year-end 1987. If the won continues rising at that pace, its appreciation rate for all of this year could surpass 24 percent, the association said.
