 Three years ago, it was hard to turn on the radio without hearing <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jett </PERSON> pound it out, or <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> whine or <PERSON> Cyndi </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauper </PERSON> tell us that girls just like to have fun. Women had a dominant role in the rock scene. However, at this year's Grammy Awards, to be presented on March 2 at Radio City Music Hall, female rockers are an extinct breed: There's no category, as there has been in the past, for `` best rock vocal performance, female.'' The Grammys have separate categories for men and women singers in pop and rhythm' n' blues. The rock category combines them this year. <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, the grandmother of rock who was named best female rock vocalist last year, is nominated along with <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Seger </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Cocker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recording </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> NARAS </ORGANIZATION> has a rule that the 6,000 industry professionals who are members must nominate 10 different people in a category for that category to exist. The screening committee listens to each nomination and decides whether it has been nominated in the right place. If it is n't, it's moved to where the committee decides it belongs `` Record company executives will always try and enter things in smaller categories where there's less competition,'' <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> said. `` We do n't accept that. `` If we do n't end up with 10 nominations in a category, rather than having insufficient competition, we fold that category into another one. It does n't happen often.'' Another rule, which <ORGANIZATION> RCA </ORGANIZATION> executive <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Fine </PERSON> unsuccessfully fought this year, is that the rock vocal performance nominations must be from solo albums; lead singers of groups are n't eligible. `` Grace Slick's ` Babylon' is a rock' n' roll track and a great solo on a Starship album. Unless she does her own solo album, it's not considered a solo,'' Fine said `` It all depends on how a record is billed. It's not fair. <PERSON> Sade </PERSON> is considered to be a group. The screening committee eliminated <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Smythe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cyndi </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauper </PERSON> from rock in the past. They determined they were pop.'' During the decade, performers such as <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cyndi </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauper </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sheena </PERSON> <PERSON> Easton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Branigan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jett </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Benatar </PERSON>, <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennox </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chaka </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Summer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> took rock in new directions with their strong images and hot music. Are these same female rockers _ and others _ suddenly in short supply? The answer to that depends on who you ask. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Guccione </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> thinks there are lots; <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> thinks there are few. <PERSON> Guccione </PERSON>, publisher of Spin magazine, is incensed that the female rock vocalist category was eliminated. `` This is literally a disservice to both males and females,'' he said. `` I think, if anything, the last year to two years has represented the emergence of the female rock superstar. It started with <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> and it's really just blossoming. `` My favorite is <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> McKee </PERSON> on ` Wheels.' There were a lot of great performances last year _ <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' ` I May Not Be Perfect But I'm Perfect for You,' <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>'s ` French Kissing in the <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION>' <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> is always to be considered. My perspective is that this past year of all years, females performed better on the whole than the males.'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, rock's best-known impresario, disagrees. `` It is an irony and phenomenon of rock' n' roll that there have been so few women accepted commercially,'' he said. `` I really do n't understand why, other than the fact that the terminology of rock' n' roll sounds more masculine than feminine. The music has got a harder edge sometimes. `` We have to generalize but a young rock' n' roll male listener may have a problem admitting that he's a fan of a female rock' n' roller, if his friends are into all-male groups A woman rocker is going to have to have that extra edge, so that he ca n't get that song out of his head. Otherwise she'll lose.'' However, in the'60s and early'70s, rock fans _ male and female _ had no trouble following <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> <PERSON> Joplin </PERSON> and Grace Slick. Later, male fans were just as enthusiastic as female fans at <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Benatar </PERSON> concerts. But singer-songwriter <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>, nominated for three Grammys this year, including `` best pop vocal, female,'' agrees with <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>. `` When <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> ran its list of the Top 100 rock albums, I noticed there were only about six women on this list,'' she said. `` <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyro </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> have made brilliant albums but they ca n't be considered rock' n' roll. `` Rock' n' roll is an aggressive, very male style of singing. Some women fit into it naturally _ like <PERSON> Chrissie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hynde </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Smythe </PERSON>. There are not many women, I think, who naturally take to rock' n' roll, but they do great music. I may have closet tendencies in that direction, but I do n't think of myself as a rock' n' roller.''

 On Jan. 24, when the Allied Jewish Appeal of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> mobilized for the year's biggest fund-raising event, there was little reason to believe that `` Super Sunday'' would live up to its name. The telephone solicitation campaign came at a disturbing moment for many Jews in this country. They have watched with increasing distress and horror as Palestinians rioted in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupied territories, and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers retaliated with beatings and bullets. Half of the money collected on `` Super Sunday'' would go to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Are American Jews so pained by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s actions that they have become disaffected with the Jewish state, and unwilling to make their customary donations? The answer is no. After the last pledge was counted, fund raisers found they had collected $ 2.5 million, up $ 400,000 over the 1986 total. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is the Jewish homeland, the Jewish heart. No one can live without a heart. They are rallying around the flag,'' said <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrack </PERSON>, general chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AJA </ORGANIZATION>. In city after city, fund raisers have reached the same conclusion. In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, the total collected Jan. 24 was $ 2.6 million, up $ 1 million from last year's figures; in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> it was $ 360,000, up about $ 50,000; in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> it was $ 187,167, up about $ 25,000. `` Wanting to see your kids work on a kibbutz, wanting to plant trees in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, wanting a Jewish state _ these things are not affected by political events,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a professor of sociology at <ORGANIZATION> Queens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and leading Jewish demographer. But there is no question that many American Jews are anguished by reports of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers beating Palestinians, burying them alive, shooting them in street warfare reminiscent of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. And some have spoken out. `` As a supporter of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> ... I am appalled beyond measure by the treatment of the rioting Palestinians by the Jews,'' wrote filmmaker <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, in a recent op-ed piece in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` I mean, fellas, are you kidding? Beatings of people by soldiers to make examples of them? Breaking the hands of men and women so they ca n't throw stones? Dragging civilians out of their houses at random to smash them with sticks in an effort to terrorize a population into quiet?'' Since early December, stone-throwing <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> protesters have challenged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s army, demanding an end to its occupation of the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> of the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, territories seized by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in its wars with the Arabs. More than 50 Arabs have been killed by Israelis in the rioting. Time magazine polled American Jews last month and found that 57 percent opposed the use of force and beatings on Arabs. A Palestinian homeland was opposed only by a small margin _ 39 percent in favor, 42 percent opposed. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lerner </PERSON>, editor of <LOCATION> Tikkun </LOCATION> magazine, a self-styled leftist alternative to Commentary that is based in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, describes the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation as `` immoral and stupid.'' `` We did not survive the gas chambers of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in order to become the oppressors of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Lerner </PERSON> writes in an upcoming editorial. <PERSON> Tikkun </PERSON> has been overwhelmed in recent weeks by calls and letters from American Jews who are outraged by what is happening in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lerner </PERSON> said. `` There has been unbelievable change,'' he says. `` It used to be that the rule was, ` There is no room for criticism.' Now, the only issue is where do you say it. Do you say it to the press, or do you say it to your friends?'' the editor says. That has been a major issue. Jewish leadership has been divided; some leaders denounce others who have gone public with their criticism _ those like Rabbi <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Schindler </PERSON>, the leader of the Reform movement who described the beatings as an `` offense to the Jewish spirit.'' `` The criticism by American Jews of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> _ I've termed it despicable,'' said Rabbi <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, a leader of Americans for a Safe <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. He deplores those who criticize from `` plush living rooms in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>.'' `` These are not protesters. These are rioters who are out there with the intent to maim, to wound and to murder,'' <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> says. A Newsday poll of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Jews found that 47 percent thought American Jews should speak out to influence <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> _ and 47 percent felt they should keep their views to themselves. Congregants say Rabbi <PERSON> Jehiel </PERSON> <PERSON> Orenstein </PERSON> of Congregation Beth El of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maplewood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, recently took the pulpit to discuss the creation of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. But when a reporter asked <PERSON> Orenstein </PERSON> to confirm his remarks, the rabbi was evasive. `` American Jews should not be the critics of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> because they're standing on the front lines and we're at a distance,'' <PERSON> Orenstein </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Orenstein </PERSON> indicated that he was uneasy with the growing influence of Rabbi <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>, the American-born member of the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION> who proposes expelling the Arabs from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its occupied territories. And he recounted that when news of the beatings spread, he told his congregation, `` It can not be the policy of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to break arms and legs and pull people from their beds and terrorize them.'' Some say <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> does not deserve the infamy that is coming its way. `` We can not give the impression that we're satisfied to have hands broken,'' says <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON>, a retired rabbi living in <LOCATION> Margate </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` But the breaking of bone, which is a horrible thing, has to be seen in context'' _ as a tiny aspect of a decent, democratic <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Many agree that the context is missing _ that the news media have distorted events in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, either by exaggerating the force applied by the Israelis or by neglecting to focus on <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> provocations. And there is the question of whether <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should be held to a higher standard than other nations. Even <PERSON> Orenstein </PERSON> asks, `` Is anybody asking the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to give back <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>?'' <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Charny </PERSON>, a 52-year-old former teacher who lives in the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Jenkintown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, feels that a higher standard is justified. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> represents a certain bright hope and ideal,'' she says. She says it is the `` moral responsibility'' of Jews around the world to speak out on Israeli issues; she cringes when she reads the headlines these days. `` We're all hoping and praying that they can find a better way of solving this problem,'' she says. Mrs. <PERSON> Charny </PERSON> and her husband buy Israeli Bonds; they have visited <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> three times. However saddened by recent events, Mrs. <PERSON> Charny </PERSON> does not envision a day when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will lose its appeal. `` It's an idea,'' she says. `` The idea that it's there for all of us, kind of like a little utopia. It's just a vision.''

 The South Korean press is enjoying a broad degree of freedom after years of tough official control, but opposition quarters maintain it still is manipulated by the government's `` hidden hands.'' Nevertheless, the nation's newspapers are reporting and commenting more vigorously on politics and other subjects that for years had been limited or banned by the government. President-elect <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>, who takes office Feb. 25, promises to ensure full press freedom and made it a key point in his election campaign. The government began easing press restrictions last summer under pressure from <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>. `` We have done much and there should be nothing to complain about,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jung-bai </PERSON>, the assistant culture-information minister. Journalists agree the government has abandoned most controls on the domestic press, such as regular visits to newspapers by security agents and the issuance of `` press guidelines'' that dictated what could be reported and in what way. Government reguirements on registration of journalists have been dropped and new legislation will end limits on newspapers having news bureaus outside their headquarters locations. There also will be no limits on the number of pages a newspaper can publish. `` The ball is in the court of the news media. It's up to them,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Min-sup </PERSON>, a ranking member of <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Opposition politicians and dissidents contend, however, that much of the press still remains under government control through `` hidden hands.'' Rep. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-ryong </PERSON>, spokesman for the main opposition <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` No basic changes have been made and the press still is no more than a public relations tool of the government.'' The opposition claims the government exerts behind-the-scenes influence and control, ranging from intimidation to patronage and bribery. They also contend the media is packed with government supporters. Rep. <PERSON> Ahn </PERSON> <PERSON> Dong-sun </PERSON>, spokesman for the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, claimed journalists are practicing self-censorship. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-hong </PERSON>, secretary-general of the dissident <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` Essentially, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> is the same as his dictatorial predecessor. He would not give in easily. We must continue to fight for press freedom.'' Several editors and reporters rejected the opposition charges of self-censorship, but said they want to help ensure `` sound political development'' without endangering social stability. One senior editor, speaking only on condition of anonymity, said many journalists are cautious because `` they suspect the true intention of the government.'' The opposition claims the country's two networks, which are state-owned, project only a government viewpoint and that opposing points of view receive little attention or are distorted. A Korea Broadcasting System -LRB- KBS -RRB- spokesman, <PERSON> Lim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ung-shik </PERSON>, rejected the opposition's charges. `` Our news and other programs are fair by any standard,'' he said. <PERSON> Lim </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> KBS </ORGANIZATION> has recently started some new programs, including talk shows to which opposition figures are regularly invited. Government officials say the criticism the networks may end after a neutral broadcasting committee is set up in June, as required by a new law, to nominate the heads of the two networks. Some opposition lawmakers will be appointed to serve on the committee to ensure fairness. The government is also preparing to inaugurate in March a new press law that would drop a requirement for government approval to start new newspapers or periodicals. Seven newspapers have so far applied to start publishing under the new law. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> now has 20 national daily newspapers with an estimated combined circulation of 12 million. The first beneficiary of the new law would be a newspaper that some 200 dissident journalists plan to publish this spring with support from 3,300 sponsors, including 1,000 college professors, 100 lawyers, 200 religious leaders and 200 literary figures. Song Kun-ho, president of the newspaper, The <ORGANIZATION> Hankyoreh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shinmun </ORGANIZATION>, said the project will be started with 5 billion won -LRB- $ 6.8 million -RRB- to be raised through public shares. Song said 15,000 people have so far responded, contributing about half of the needed money. Song and the other journalists, dismissed from their previous jobs on grounds of anti-government activity, said their newspaper would emphasize human rights and spearhead press freedom. The influential <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> also has announced it will start a newspaper in April and set up a nationwide radio network in September. Critics of the government contend the new press law is restrictive because it stipulates that new newspapers must use certain kinds of presses that cost millions of dollars. They contend this would keep control of the press in the hands of establishment groups.

 Cafe owner <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizman </PERSON> said when <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> police beat up his Arab workers three days ago, he understood the depth of distrust between Jews and Arabs after months of clashes in the occupied territories. <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Simon </PERSON>, 38, had learned the lesson a few days earlier. <PERSON> Ben-Simon </PERSON>, a Jew, was beaten up in an industrial area near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> because, he said, his Israeli attackers thought he was an Arab. Growing numbers of Palestinians who work in and around this coastal city of 1.5 million people are subject to harassment, primarily by Israelis made suspicious by the unprecedented fury and violence of Arabs opposing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 20-year occupation in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Arab harassment is leading to a climate of fear among Palestinians and concern among many Israelis. City officials estimate about 40,000 Arabs work in the <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> metropolitan area. There are also about 10,000 Arabs with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> citizenship who live in the area. `` This incident ... is, of course, linked to the unrest in the territories,'' Police Minister <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bar-Lev </PERSON> said in a statement of the beating of <PERSON> Weizman </PERSON>'s workers. `` I am afraid the situation in the territories is having a bad influence on the morals and values of the rest of Israeli society,'' he added. One of the four beaten Arabs, 20-year-old <PERSON> Maysara </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Ijela </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that police entered an apartment shared by nine <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> workers Friday and `` did not say anything at first. They just started to hit us with their hands and walkie-talkies, and also kick us.'' `` One policeman said ` You are smelly Arabs. You go home, throw stones at Jews and afterward return here to work,''' <PERSON> Al-Ijela </PERSON> told the daily <ORGANIZATION> Hadashot </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Weizman </PERSON>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Shelly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cafe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dizengoff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said after his workers were beaten, he moved them out of their apartment into a hotel and promised to find them a new, safe place to live. `` Three of them ... said no thanks and quit,'' he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` The police said they went into the apartment because they thought the Arabs were organizing something, but that is ridiculous. It's just Israeli suspicion of Arabs.'' `` I guess the police had a right to go into that apartment. But the way they handled it was very bad. I need those workers.'' One Israeli, <PERSON> Dalit </PERSON> <PERSON> Laub </PERSON>, witnessed the beatings when she walked past the Arabs' first-floor apartment and glanced in the window. `` It was really violent. But I was afraid to get involved ... I thought of calling the police _ but they were the police,'' she told Hadashot. City Hall was reluctant to get involved. `` The problem of beating Arabs has to be taken care of by the police because it is a criminal issue,'' city spokesman <PERSON> Shabtai </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheval </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>. He refused to say how many incidents involving Arabs were reported in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> over the last month. Police said they were investigating and legal action would be taken if the allegations were found to be correct, police spokeswoman <PERSON> Shlomit </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzberg </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>. Police also were investigating the incident involving <PERSON> Ben-Simon </PERSON>, who was beaten senseless and left on a street. He was driving to work on Feb. 12 when two Israelis flagged him down. `` I thought they needed help, but when I stopped, one of them shouted, ` Here's an Arab maniac!,''' <PERSON> Ben-Simon </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. `` I said, ` Hey guys, what's going on? I'm not an Arab.''' His protestations did no good. <PERSON> Ben-Simon </PERSON> saw the license plate number of the car as the two sped away, but he could n't pick himself up. An Arab worker helped <PERSON> Ben-Simon </PERSON> off the street and he was taken to a hospital, where his head was stitched. Israeli newspapers reported the first case of harassment about a month ago. An Arab youth said he was picked up on a <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> street by two men who identified themselves as police, taken to a garbage dump and beaten. Some harassment has come from Arab militants. City Hall spokesman <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said more than 100 Arab workers left their jobs in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Yermiyahu </LOCATION> restaurant district last week after their lives and families were threatened if they disobeyed calls from <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists to stay home. There have been cases of alleged discrimination, as well. One Palestinian said he was turned away from a popular <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> discotheque. Another complained in an <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> TV interview he was barred `` for security reasons'' from taking a small craft flight with his two children. One Gazan working in a <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> restaurant gave a statement to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> last week on condition that his name not be used. He said he was saving money to get married. `` But now, I get this message saying ` Stop working for the Jews, stop working for the oppressors,' and I have to make up my mind,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. `` Most of the others have gone. They do n't want anything to happen to them or their families. For me, it is also dangerous.''

 The turban of <PERSON> Darshan </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a 12-year-old Sikh, was half burned from the heat of the mud oven where he hid to escape death. But the killers _ Sikhs themselves _ yanked him out, and he died in a burst of gunfire. The boy, his elder brother and their father all died in the courtyard of the village of <LOCATION> Fattu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bheela </LOCATION>, home of 2,000 Sikhs. It was one more case of Sikhs killing Sikhs. Never before in the radicals' six-year campaign for an independent homeland have the killers turned their guns so relentlessly on people of their own minority faith. Of the 283 deaths blamed on <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> militants this year in the Sikh-dominated northern state of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, at least 169 victims were Sikhs. On Friday and Saturday, 31 people died in attacks, at least 20 of them Sikhs. `` The militants want the message to go deep _ that they will not only kill those who oppose them, but even those who refuse to support them,'' said the <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> district police superintendent, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Izhar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alam </PERSON>. <PERSON> Harbhajan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaur </PERSON>, <PERSON> Darshan </PERSON>'s mother, told of the attack last week in the village 18 miles north of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> holy city and heart of the radical campaign. She said she was wounded but because of fear, no neighbor came to help. `` I was laying in my courtyard the whole night, bleeding,'' she said from her hospital bed. The Sikh campaign began with attacks on Hindus, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s religious majority but a minority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> Last year, most of the 1,000 victims of Sikh radicals were Hindus. The radicals allege economic and cultural domination by <PERSON> Hindus </PERSON> and want an independent homeland for their 16 million people. But theories vary considerably on <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> guns are now aiming at Sikhs. `` Most of the men killed are either former terrorists or harborers and their families who now refuse to give shelter to the militants,'' said <PERSON> S.S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Virk </PERSON>, deputy director general of the paramilitary <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. The killers themselves claim all Sikh victims are police informers or enemies of the 500-year-old faith, founded as an alternative to the beliefs of warring Moslems and Hindus. `` We shed the blood of only enemies, not of innocents or passive people,'' said <PERSON> Giani </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagir </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Panthic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella group that controls the Sikh movement. `` Write it down,'' he commanded during an interview in a bare, windowless room in the Sikhs' Golden Temple. `` I have led half a dozen attacks myself and in every case, we killed only police informers.'' Why are Sikh women and children also killed? `` Have you heard of an old <LOCATION> Punjabi </LOCATION> saying _ when you grind wheat to get flour, some millets also get crushed?'' said <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, 45, a large man with flowing beard. <PERSON> Dewan </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a police detective in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, said in most cases the killers wipe out all witnesses because they are recognized by the victims' families. In 19 of the 25 cases he analyzed, the victims knew the killers. In each of the 19 cases, police found half-emptied glasses of milk or sarbat, sweetened water with lemon, which were believed served to the assailants. Rarely did the killers have to force their entry, <PERSON> Dewan </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said. Such was the case with the family of <PERSON> Darbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaur </PERSON>, 50, in the village of <LOCATION> Khera </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bala-Chak </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Kathunangal </LOCATION>. `` Five Sikh boys came and asked for my younger son, <PERSON> Surjeet </PERSON>. He opened the door and asked his wife to heat up some milk for the visitors,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kaur </PERSON> said. `` After a few minutes they fired at Surjeet,'' She said. <PERSON> Surjeet </PERSON>, her husband, another son, and a 4-year-old granddaughter were killed, while Mrs. <PERSON> Kaur </PERSON> and her daughter-in-law hid behind a bolted kitchen door. <PERSON> Surjeet </PERSON> had been arrested in July for illegally possessing a firearm and was believed to be a member of the radical group <PERSON> Babbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalsa </PERSON>. He was freed on bail Jan. 1. `` He was not a police informer, but he was required under bail provision to report to the police station once a week,'' said <PERSON> Kathunangal </PERSON> police officer <PERSON> Subba </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>. `` So his former associates drew the conclusion that <PERSON> Surjeet </PERSON> had turned informer.'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, responsible for maintaining order in 70 villages with a population of 200,000, said <PERSON> Surjeet </PERSON> was afraid he might be killed. But he said the police do n't have the resources to protect everyone. The killers often leave behind a note written on the stationery of <LOCATION> Khalistan </LOCATION>, the name of their unborn Sikh nation. The letters sometimes even carry reference numbers, such as the A-159 on one left where 12-year-old <PERSON> Darshan </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> died. `` They are our death warrants. ` A' Stands for <PERSON> Akal </PERSON> -LRB- the immortal throne of the Sikh faith -RRB- and the police informer to be killed was 159 on our list,'' explained <PERSON> Giani </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagir </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, the militant spokesman. He left no doubt that more death warrants could be expected. `` If any of the men on the hit list die a natural death, we will consider it as a great insult to our faith,'' he said.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic reforms have been formulated and explained sufficiently to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people, and now it's time to `` start taking action,'' <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s top economist says. <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aganbegyan </PERSON> also said there are `` painful and difficult'' days ahead for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under `` perestroika,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s wholesale restructuring of the stagnant economy, and that bureaucratic opposition to the reforms remains <PERSON> Aganbegyan </PERSON>, the chief economic adviser to the Soviet leader and an architect of perestroika, also said the average Soviet family has yet to reap its benefits. `` A little bit more than two years have elapsed since we started the process, the initial stage, where we are developing our concepts, making our programs, trying to understand what's going on, what has to be done, and a period during which we have to try to convince people of the necessity undertaking these new changes,'' he said. `` This period is now coming to an end. We are getting to a much more critical stage, which is a stage where we have to start taking action.'' He and several of his colleagues on Monday outlined the history and pitfalls of perestroika to a conference of economics students and faculty at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> as part of an U.S.-Soviet academic exchange program. <PERSON> Aganbegyan </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has `` only made the first steps'' toward loosening the top-heavy central controls that have driven the economy since the <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> era and emphasized heavy industry over consumer goods. `` In fact, most families have not really benefited from what's been done so far,'' he said through a translator `` We have to accelerate the whole process so as to achieve a breakthrough in the next two or three years so that everyone in the country will feel he has a stake in the process.'' In addition to consumer goods, the biggest Soviet economic failures during the past 15 years were in housing, health care, education and agriculture, he said. To remedy the problems, he cited modest increases in construction of new apartments and budget increases for education and medicine, including 30 percent salary increases for teachers, doctors and some other health care workers. He did not say how the military budget would be affected. He also singled out the planned overhaul the machine tool industry, which will be `` the basis for the reconstruction of the whole manufacturing sector.'' `` In 1985, we were able to replace 3.1 percent of all our machine tools. In 1987, 9 percent were replaced, and by 1990 we hope to replace 13 percent of the machine tools yearly,'' <PERSON> Aganbegyan </PERSON> said. `` This is a painful and difficult process, but we have to go through it. We have n't any other alternative.'' <PERSON> Aganbegyan </PERSON> also cited the policies of `` khozrachyot,'' or self-accounting, that went into effect Jan. 1. The law gives state-run factories and firms more autonomy, with more emphasis on profits and job performance. He said factories must go `` on a completely cost-accounting basis, self-financing basis and self-administrating basis.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policies of perestroika have come under `` a good deal of opposition, however, from the people in the economic administrative bureaucracies,'' in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s 15 republics, he said `` We have reduced the staff and fired or eliminated 110,000 jobs in the central and republican administrative apparatus,'' <PERSON> Aganbegyan </PERSON> said. The opposition has not been confined to the bureaucracy, said another conference participant, <PERSON> Timur </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Timofeev </PERSON>. `` We can not say that the whole working class 100 percent is for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Timofeev </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. `` The new working class _ the younger generation, the much-more-educated generation _ is really the leading force, the dynamic force of perestroika,'' he said. Some Soviets `` are accustomed to the old ways of work,'' preferring less pay and less work. <PERSON> Aganbegyan </PERSON> acknowledged that the restructuring at many factories and companies in the next 15 to 20 years will throw 16 million of people out of work _ in a nation where the constitution provides that everyone shall have a job. These people `` will therefore have to be retrained and given additional jobs,'' he said. Special employment offices will be set up to retrain them and find them work, he said.

Second in the studio's one-two turnstile punch was `` Shoot to Kill,'' featuring <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Poitier </PERSON> in his first movie in nine years, taking in $ 4.8 million in its second week of release. `` Moonstruck'' was a close third with $ 4.7 million last weekend and `` Action Jackson'' took in $ 3.6 million in its second week to place fourth. Meanwhile, the No. 5 spot was occupied by <PERSON> Disney-Touchstone </PERSON>'s `` Three Men And A Baby'' which kept turnstiles spinning in its 12th week of release with a $ 3.5 million take The movie has made $ 136 million so far. The three Disney-Touchstone films have raked in $ 220 million for the studio and its <ORGANIZATION> Buena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> distribution arm, whose senior vice president <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said simply: `` We are delighted with these latest box office figures.'' Universal's creepy `` The Serpent and the Rainbow'' brought in $ 2.3 million for a drop to sixth in its second week of release. The <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> film `` She's Having a Baby'' was seventh with $ 2.1 million and <PERSON> Justine </PERSON> <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON>'s `` Satisfaction'' was eighth with $ 1.7 million. `` The Last Emperor'' was ninth with $ 1.71 million in receipts and `` Broadcast News,'' which got <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> acting Oscar nominations, was 10th with $ 1.63 million.

 An administrative law judge was wrong when he ruled last year that <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> illegally monopolized the domestic market for dry ink used in some office copying machines, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> says. The commission, in a 6-0 ruling Monday, overturned Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathias </PERSON> and terminated the investigation. <PERSON> Mathias </PERSON> had ruled in November that <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION>, a copy machine giant, had violated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade laws by unfairly disparaging independent toner distributors. <ORGANIZATION> Aunyx </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a small toner producer based in <LOCATION> Hingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, had charged that <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION> representatives were telling customers that toner from competitors was `` pirate'' merchandise. <ORGANIZATION> ITC </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Madaj </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said an opinion detailing why the commission overturned the judge's decision will not be available for at least several days. He declined to outline the commission's reasoning. `` Naturally we're very disappointed,'' said <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanley </PERSON>, vice president for dealer sales at <LOCATION> Aunyx </LOCATION>. `` We do n't know why the commission voted this way.'' <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION> lawyers argued that corporate representatives did not make disparaging remarks about independent competitors, and if they did, `` it was very minor stuff, the kind of competitive talk that is normal in any industry where there are competitors,'' said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Applebaum </PERSON>. `` We have always said that we would be completely vindicated as this case evolved,'' <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Fujio </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitarai </PERSON> said in a statement from corporate headquarters in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Success </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` This decision makes clear that we were right on the law, on the facts and in the way we market our products.'' <PERSON> Aunyx </PERSON> has estimated that the toner market for copiers in question is worth about $ 250 million annually, but <PERSON> Applebaum </PERSON> said `` that sounds to me very exaggerated.'' The companies competed for sale of toner for certain types of <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION> copiers, mostly low - and medium-volume office machines Aunyx President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Langone </PERSON> said last year that <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION> had about 99 percent of that market while <PERSON> Aunyx </PERSON> and other independent toner dealers take between 20 percent and 50 percent of the toner markets of other copying giants like <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> company, which once had 85 employees, is down to fewer than 30, Ms. <PERSON> Hanley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bart </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, an attorney representing <PERSON> Aunyx </PERSON>, said he would appeal the <ORGANIZATION> ITC </ORGANIZATION> ruling to the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>.

 Farmers hear a lot about the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s barriers to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural exports, but there is a brighter side too. The Europeans, particularly French consumers, are developing as an even larger market for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food products. Overall, the 12-nation bloc took $ 6.8 billion of the $ 27.9 billion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm exports in the 1987 fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30, up 5 percent from 1986. A further gain to around $ 7 billion is expected this year. Despite the increase and prospects for further growth, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm exports are still far below the record levels of the early 1980s. Thus, every possibility is examined eagerly by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> trade experts. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> ranks second only to <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> as a regional market for American farmers. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm imports of $ 5.55 billion last year, is the largest single-country foreign market. A recent <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> report says, `` The time is right for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exporters to consider the French food market.'' Last year <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> imported $ 495 million worth of agricultural products from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, up from $ 435 million in 1986 and $ 403 million in 1985. In the heyday of the early'80s, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> bought a peak of $ 625 million worth of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food and raw commodities. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> is the largest country in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, with a population of 55 million and an area of 213,000 square miles _ about four-fifths the size of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, says the report by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` Changing lifestyles _ more working women, urban rather than rural life, eating lunch at work, and a greater standard of living _ have led to changes in the food habits of the French people,'' the report said. `` They are consuming more processed products, like canned food and precooked dishes.'' For example, the report said, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s per capita consumption of fresh vegetables held steady from 1967 to 1982 but the average use of frozen vegetables rose from 0.5 pounds per capita to 6.6 pounds. The consumption of canned vegetables jumped to 44 pounds per person in 1982 from 24.9 pounds in 1967. `` According to the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> ANIA </ORGANIZATION>, there have been dramatic changes in consumer spending patterns since 1960,'' the report said. `` The association's data show that the French buy more pastries, cooked and preserved meats, cheese, ice cream, cooked dishes, confectionery products and non-alcoholic beverages as a percentage of their total budget.'' Meanwhile, the report added, the share of family spending on wine, bread, fruits and vegetables, and butter, has decreased. The analysis, prepared by <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miesel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, was included in the current <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>, a quarterly magazine issued by the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agency. American goods compete with agricultural products from other <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> member countries, which are generally admitted freely into <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. `` However, specific products of high quality with unique characteristics can find a place on the French market regardless of barriers, exchange rates and competitive pressures,'' the report said.

<HEAD>Social Security Mailouts Affected January Surplus, December
Deficit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government enjoyed a rare budget surplus last month because Social Security checks for January were mailed before the new year began. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that the surplus between government spending and revenues jumped to $ 16.09 billion in January, a sharp turnaround following a December deficit of $ 24.22 billion. Both months were influenced by Social Security, the government's biggest benefits program The government ended up making two payments in December, the regular one and the January payment, which was mailed on Dec. 31 because of the New Year's holiday. In January, government revenue totaled $ 81.79 billion, down 4.3 percent from December. Government spending was almost half the December total, dropping to $ 65.71 billion in January, compared with $ 109.74 billion the month before. The surplus was the first since September and only the second in the past 16 months. For the first four months of the fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, the deficit totals $ 65.81 billion, down 0.7 percent from the same period in the 1987 fiscal year. For the first four months of this fiscal year, government revenues have totaled $ 286.66 billion, 5.5 percent higher than a year ago. Government spending totaled $ 352.46 billion, an increase of 4.2 percent over the same period a year ago. For all of 1988, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is projecting the budget deficit will fall to $ 146.74 billion, down 2.5 percent from last year's deficit of $ 150.4 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, using less optimistic assumptions about economic growth this year, projects a 1988 budget deficit of $ 157 billion, substantially above the target of $ 144 billion set in the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sent <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> his budget recommendations for 1989 last Thursday, predicting a 1989 deficit of $ 129.5 billion. The largest spending categories in January were, as usual, the military, followed by Social Security, other programs in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and interest on the national debt. Military spending totaled $ 19.23 billion last month and $ 93.52 billion for the fiscal year so far, up 6.5 percent from the same period a year ago. Spending for Social Security totaled just $ 652 million last month and $ 70.14 billion for the past four months, up 4.6 percent from a year ago. The other Health and Human Services programs, including <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and Medicaid, spent $ 50.51 billion in January and $ 49.93 billion so far this budget year, a 1.1 percent increase over 1987. Interest on the $ 2.2 trillion national debt totaled $ 14.67 billion last month and $ 75.77 billion so far this fiscal year, an increase of 9.8 percent over the same period last year. For the 1988 fiscal year, interest payments on the debt are expected to total $ 210.06 billion, accounting for 20 percent of total federal spending.

 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s abrupt resignation blew the lid off his split with <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and revealed bitter infighting at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> as it grapples with budget cuts after years of Reagan-era increases. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> resigned Monday and decided to air some dirty linen on the way out, accusing <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> of needlessly sinking the administration's dream of building a 600-ship fleet. He further accused <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> of ordering him to lie about internal budget fighting, saying the defense chief had written him a note saying he should deny news stories reporting it was the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> _ and not the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> _ proposing to mothball ships. `` Now, I'm not going to deny the truth,'' <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said. `` This building needs to be led. ... It needs some vision,'' he continued. `` If I had a piece of advice to give to Secretary <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, it would be to spend a lot more time with the top leaders in this building. `` He's been spending a lot of time with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and a lot of time on the -LRB- Capitol -RRB- <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>. I think they -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> leaders -RRB- need to feel his vision and to understand what he believes in.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> declined to respond Monday, issuing a written statement saying only that he learned of <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s resignation `` with regret.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> added in a separate statement, though, that if <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> decided he could not `` defend the department's decisions'' on the budget, then `` under the circumstances, he has done the honorable thing.'' An administration official who asked not to be identified said <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> was recommending that <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, the assistant to the president for legislative affairs, be nominated to replace <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>. The White House might announce <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>'s nomination today at the same time it formally accepts <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s resignation, the source said. The 42-year-old <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, a highly decorated <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> combat veteran who earlier worked as an assistant defense secretary, said he had been contemplating resignation for some time but did n't make up his mind until Sunday. The final impetus, he said, was the submission to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last week of the fiscal 1989 <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> shaped it without regard to the advice of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s top civilian and military leadership, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said. `` I can not support the reductions that are in this budget,'' he said. The massive military buildup under President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, which has seen the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s budget more than double, is coming to a halt because of concerns about the huge federal deficits run up during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, following up on a deficit-reduction agreement reached by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in December, submitted a fiscal 1989 budget proposal totaling $ 299.5 billion, slightly more than for fiscal 1988 but unlikely to cover inflation. It cuts the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s original 1989 spending plan by $ 12.3 billion and calls for, among other things, mothballing 16 older frigates Those ships are at the heart of the dispute that erupted Monday. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said they did n't have to be retired and that if they were, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> could never reach its goal of deploying a 600-ship fleet. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> maintains the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> will end fiscal 1989 with 580 ships and can still reach 600 by fiscal 1992. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON>, all have insisted that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> needs a minimum of 600 warships to satisfy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitments around the world without requiring overly long deployments <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, in his letter of resignation and in a meeting with reporters, said he had provided <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> with three different plans for cutting the necessary dollars without mothballing the ships. At the very least, he said, the 16 frigates could be transferred to the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> at a cost of less than $ 100 million and stay on standby. `` In each case, the advice of this senior -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- leadership, concurred in by the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, was ignored,'' <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> wrote. `` I can only conclude that the decision to reduce the level of our fleet ... was motivated by other than military and strategic reasoning.'' <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> declined to say why he thought <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> had ignored his advice. A ranking <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official who asked not to be named, however, said <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> executives for a time eyed the 16 frigates as ships that could be offered for sale to <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> at a cut rate. <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> was n't interested, the source added. The administration is trying to find ways of increasing military assistance to <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> to preserve access to an air base on the <LOCATION> Azores </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said: `` Secretary <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> is having to make some very difficult adjustments in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to accommodate budgetary reductions. Secretary <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> indicates he is unable to operate under these constraints, but I know the president feels he has given very valuable service to the country.'' <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, who became <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary 10 months ago after serving as an assistant defense secretary under <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, is an attorney and the author of the best-selling Vietnam War novel `` Fields of Fire.'' He said he probably would return to writing.

<TEXT>
 They call it Super Tuesday. A better name might be Tarmac Tuesday. Or maybe Satellite Tuesday. The Tuesday comes in two weeks, on March 8. What's super about it is that the day will be the closest <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has ever come to holding a national primary election to select presidential nominees. Democratic and Republican nominees may not be decided then, but the presidential landscape will be altered. Twenty of the 50 states hold primaries or caucuses, and they are scattered from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. Yet Tuesday has a distinctly Southern flavor. Fourteen of those 20 states are in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> or border regions. Every state of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> save <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> holds delegate contests that day _ and the Republicans in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> hold theirs three days earlier. To campaign across that vast expanse of country, the presidential candidates have found agreement. The only way really is for the candidate to wing his way to as many cities as possible each day in an effort to get his face, and maybe even a few of his words, on the local television news. No candidate, they reason, can buy enough television commercials to carry 20 states in a two - to three-week campaign, although some will try So they aim for the `` free'' TV time. Hence Tarmac Tuesday. Many of the candidates are seeing no more of the states or cities where they campaign than can be viewed from the airports where they hold news conferences, or more often the case, from the single event they hold not far from the airport. Then it's quickly off to the next event in the next `` media market.'' They are `` press hits'' in the jargon of this campaign. `` Look for a lot of hits that are close to the airports,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, a polltaker and strategist for one of the Democrats, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. `` You look for your opportunities within 20 minutes from the airports, so you can get back and on to the next one.'' Quick campaign stops are nothing new to presidential campaigns. But it's hardly what the architects of the Southern regional primary had in mind. They wanted to take some of the thunder away from <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. For all the criticism of those two early states, candidates do spend a lot of time there and really do meet with real voters. The way it worked out, those states may have gotten even more attention this time, while the South is still waiting to hear about its concerns of, say, rural poverty and development. But still a better name for this mega-primary, <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> says, may be Satellite Tuesday. Developments in television technology have played directly to the candidates' slavish need to get television airtime. Local TV stations now have _ and use _ the technology to get live reports from from virtually anywhere. The candidates are trying to exploit that by accommodating television stations in the Super Tuesday states, not just by tailoring local events but by making far-flung campaign appearances available via satellite to stations elsewhere. Campaigns may pay to have video pictures of their candidate at an apperance beamed up to a satellite where it is available for stations that want it, even if they did n't have crews on the scene. `` We have found in these small markets, particularly with agriculture stories, we've had enormous success'' getting the candidate on the air, <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said. Hence <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> makes three stops as he flies across three time zones one day last week. And he walks through a nearly idle electronics factory, to underscore his attack on unfair trade practices, with only a half-dozen people to hear him talk. It was the handful of television cameras there that he had in mind. Never mind that the factory was in <LOCATION> Rapid </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, S.D. It's one of the five states with primaries or caucuses in the three weeks before Super Tuesday, but it is a state where the primary is meaningless in the allocation of delegates. That will come later at the state caucus. What counted was that the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> story that day appeared not only on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> television, but on some Southern stations too. It is the old story of television creating a `` global village.'' And it means that the campaigns pick events and locations that meld with the point a candidate is trying to make. His message for the day will be summed up in a 30 second bite on television that evening, if he's lucky. So look for <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> to go to a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> automobile factory and a <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, steel mill to make his point about foreign competition and lost jobs. `` It's Super-Satellite Tuesday,'' <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said. `` Pretty soon the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> will have to start attaching those -LRB- satellite -RRB- dishes to the limos so these guys can do link-ups from the road.''

<HEAD>SRP, DOE Officials Deny Acrimony Before Power Reduction Decision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 There were technical disagreements but no acrimony during meetings of scientists that led to the decision to reduce power levels at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION>'s nuclear reactors, plant officials said Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday that the power levels were reduced by federal officials following a stormy meeting during which scientists warned that the reactor was operating beyond the demonstrated capacity of its emergency cooling system. The Department of Energy officials initially were reluctant to order the reduction because they did n't want to admit they had made a mistake and risk triggering public pressure to close the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> facility, the newspaper reported, citing unidentified sources. The decision was made during a meeting Feb. 12 to reduce power levels at two of the three government reactors at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> _ the last <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> facility that produces plutonium, said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON>, the department's chief of reactors at <ORGANIZATION> SRP </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> described the 10 percent reduction in power _ the third reduction in 14 months _ as a routine action reflecting a change in the way reactor temperatures are measured. The reduction dropped the operating level from 1,100 megawatts thermal to 960 megawatts. Power had been reduced previously from 2,200 megawatts. But the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said its sources said the reduction was ordered only at the insistence of scientists working for <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION>'s contractor at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> The scientists had discovered a fundamental error in the calculations that have been used for decades to justify reactor operating levels, the newspaper said. <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> manager <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> decided to reduce the levels following a confrontation with the scientists at a Feb. 8 meeting during which a top <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> scientist threw his security badge on the table in front of <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION> and threatened to `` go public'' unless the power levels were lowered, the sources said. An unidentified DOE official told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that the department did not want to `` raise the specter of continuing problems at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> denied Monday there was a fundamental error in the DOE calculations and denied there were any heated disagreements during either of the meetings Feb. 8 and Feb. 12. `` There were lots of technical discussion, which helped the decision-making process,'' <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> said. `` There was no dissention. Utilmately, everyone agreed with the decision to make the minor adjustment.''

<HEAD>Independent Prosecutor Law To Be Ruled On This Summer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> will be the setting for a crucial constitutional fight this spring when it studies a post-Watergate law creating special prosecutors to investigate high-ranking government officials. The justices announced Monday they will hear arguments in the dispute in April with a decision expected by July. The eventual ruling will determine the future of court-appointed independent counsels. It also will affect the criminal conviction of former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> and the investigation of <ORGANIZATION> ex-Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>, prosecuted by an independent counsel, was convicted of lying to a grand jury and to a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that investigated his lobbying activities. <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> is under investigation by an independent counsel on charges he lied to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. An independent counsel's probe of Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> for his role in the Iran-Contra affair is expected to survive any adverse high court decision on the law. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here ruled Jan. 22 that the law improperly grants presidential appointment powers to the federal courts and encroaches on the president's exclusive authority to enforce criminal laws. The law authorizes a special court, acting at the attorney general's request, to appoint the independent counsels. Independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> received a parallel appointment from Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> to conduct the Iran-Contra investigation. That power insulates his office from the constitutional attack on the special prosecutor law. Similarly, independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, who successfully prosecuted former presidential aide <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> on illegal lobbying charges, also accepted a backup appointment. But the investigations of <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> and <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> were not buttressed by such parallel grants of authority from the attorney general. The case before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was brought by independent counsel <PERSON> Alexia </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>. She is investigating charges that <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, a former assistant attorney general, lied to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 during a dispute over the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s cleanup program for toxic waste. The court on Monday allowed <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> to resume her investigation of <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, raising the possibility that grand jury indictments could be returned before the high court's ruling. The appeals court ruling temporarily derailed <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>'s investigation Meanwhile, the court returned to full strength Monday with the addition of Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> to fill a vacancy that had lasted eight months. With <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> available as a tie-breaking vote if necessary, the court took the highly unusual step of agreeing to hear a second round of arguments in two cases already under study. In one case, involving the death of a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> helicopter co-pilot, the justices will decide whether defense contractors may be forced to pay damages for on-duty accidents involving members of the military. The second case, involving the convicted killer of an <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> policeman, deals with the the disqualification of a potential juror who said he would vote to impose the death penalty if the accused were convicted. But the court refused to reconsider its 4-4 decision last December striking down an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> law that could have made abortions more difficult to obtain for some teen-agers. The justices rejected a request by <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> officials to restudy the law now that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> has taken his seat. In other action, the court: _ Dealt a blow to religious fundamentalists by killing a lawsuit challenging the required use of `` godless'' textbooks in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> public schools The justices, without a recorded dissenting vote, left intact a federal appeals court ruling that said it was constitutional to require fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> children to read the objected-to books. <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> LaHaye </PERSON>, president of the conservative Concerned Women for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, said: `` A dark cloud of religious oppression looms over <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s schoolhouses today. Religious tolerance in our nation's classrooms has been dealt a devastating blow.'' _ Agreed to decide whether local governments may impose affirmative-action programs requiring minority participation in public works projects The justices will study an invalidated <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, program that set aside 30 percent of the value of public works projects for firms at least one-half owned by minorities. _ Refused to let a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, hospital withhold the names of its blood donors from a woman suing on charges her baby daughter contracted AIDS after receiving transfusions _ Said it will hear arguments by coal mining companies and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration aimed at blocking the possible awards of billions of dollars in `` black lung'' benefits to thousands of miners _ Agreed to decide whether the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collegiate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> should be barred from suspending <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON> as basketball coach at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nevada-Las </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vegas </ORGANIZATION> for alleged recruiting violations _ Voted to decide when police need court warrants before searching from helicopters for marijuana growing in fenced-in yards

<TEXT>
 Former TV evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> is borrowing heavily going into the critical Super Tuesday primaries, taking out a massive $ 5.5 million loan for his presidential campaign, financial reports show. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> ended January with $ 5.5 million in the bank, but his campaign had $ 6 million in debts as he far outspent any other candidate on the Super Tuesday contests involving 20 states on March 8. Rival GOP contenders <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, on the other hand, remained in good shape. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the overall fund-raising leader, ended January with $ 9.2 million in cash on hand and $ 811,029 in obligations, while <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had $ 4.2 million and $ 654,269 in bills to pay, their latest financial statements show. Neither had any loans outstanding, but the other <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> contender, Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, took out $ 750,000 in loans to get through the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> contests this month. Among Democratic candidates, money leader <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had the most cash available, $ 4 million. Besides his loan, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> reported contributions of $ 1.3 million during January. His report also listed as receipts the $ 6.5 million in federal matching funds that he applied for but had said he might not use. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had said he was philosophically opposed to the public financing system and his staff said he would only use matching funds if he needed to stay competitive. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s campaign did not return calls Monday night to answer questions about the loan, by far the biggest borrowing of any campaign for the 1988 election. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> paid off a short-term loan of $ 1.5 million that his attorney has said was secured with his matching funds, his report showed. The latest financial reports were due at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday, but <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had not filed his by Monday. Aides said it was still being worked on Monday, and released summary pages Monday evening. However, details of the loan were not included. The sizable expenditures on this month's <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> contests and subsequent spending toward Super Tuesday are not reflected in the new reports, which cover the period through Jan. 31. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> has spent more than any other candidate against the overall spending ceiling which is set by election law at $ 27 million for the primary season. He reported spending $ 17.6 million against the cap. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, conversely, while raising more money than any other candidate, has been watching his budget and has spent the least of any <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> contender against the cap. He reported spending $ 10.7 million against the ceiling, compared with <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s $ 12.8 million and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s $ 13.5 million. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> also spent the most of any campaign in a single state _ $ 1 million in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, compared with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s $ 335,743 and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s $ 81,645 Wealthy campaigns must keep from spending too much early in the campaign, because they could leave themselves unable to spend money on later contests without going over the limit. On the Democratic side, none of the candidates approached the cap, with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spending the most at $ 7.8 million. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor also had the biggest Democratic bank account at the beginning of this month, $ 4 million with $ 511,789 in bills to pay, while the next nearest Democrat, Sen. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, had $ 2 million with $ 84,248 in obligations. Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., borrowed $ 523,674 in January and ended the month with a $ 691,069 debt and only $ 401,176 in the bank He raised $ 534,259 in contributions for the month, $ 1.9 million in matching funds, and $ 523,674 in loans. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., entered February with $ 820,260 in debts and $ 172,477 in cash on hand He collected $ 212,702 in contributions and $ 1.9 million in matching funds during January. Aides for both <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> have said that fund-raising picked up this month and that they have whittled down their debts. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had ignored <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> to concentrate on the Super Tuesday states, but he raised very little money during the time the other candidates were campaigning hard in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. He collected only $ 180,746 in contributions during January, in addition to the $ 1.8 million in matching funds he got, his report showed. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> raised $ 804,839 in contributions and got $ 3.5 million matching funds. Democratic contender <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> reported raising $ 610,036 in donations, plus $ 598,021 in matching funds during January, ending the month with $ 509,978 in cash on hand and $ 354,881 in obligations. Former <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> ended the month with $ 615,547 in cash on hand and $ 24,484 in debts after collecting $ 70,303 in contributions and $ 937,325 in matching funds. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> continued a hand-to-mouth campaign, ending January with a debt of $ 1.3 million after raising $ 1 million for the month. However, his political director, <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, said the debt would be wiped out when <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s federal mathching funds come in this month. He insisted the campaign is not in financial trouble, saying a heavy mail solicitation program and fund-raising events are reaping about $ 400,000 a week. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> raised $ 1.2 million in contributions for January and got $ 5.6 in matching funds, while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> collected $ 767,892 privately and got $ 6.4 million in matching funds. Most candidates got very large matching fund payments in January because that was the first months the money was released, and the sums were based on the candidates' fund raising for all preceding months. Candidates can get matching funds from the federal Treasury for each contribution of $ 250 or less that they raise in private funds. The matching fund is supported by the $ 1 checkoff on individual income tax returns.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> were the Democratic leaders in the Southern and border states that vote on Super Tuesday, according to a poll published today, with <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> very close behind. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was the favorite among Democratic voters nationwide, according to the <ORGANIZATION> CBS-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll. The survey found 21 percent of registered <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary voters queried nationwide said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was their choice for the Democratic presidential nomination. In the Southern and border states, which hold primaries or caucuses March 8, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had 19 percent, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had 16 percent and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 13 percent. With a 4 percentage-point margin of error, that pointed to a close race. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> had 11 percent and former <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, 10 percent. The survey also included <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, which holds its primary March 5. In the nationwide sampling, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, with 13 percent, was second behind <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the poll found. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> had 12 percent and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> 10 percent, with a margin of error of 3 points. Twenty-three percent of both samplings did n't answer or said they did n't know. On the Republican side, the CBS-Times poll found Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leading strongly both in the South and nationwide. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> garnered the backing of 51 percent of the registered Republicans in Super Tuesday states to 20 percent for Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. In the nationwide sampling, the poll found 42 percent opting for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and 27 percent for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. The telephone poll of 933 Democrats and 684 Republicans nationwide taken Feb. 17-21 had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points on the Democratic side and four percent for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> race, the Times said. The newspaper said 575 Democrats and 375 Republicans were surveyed in the Super Tuesday states and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. The CBS-Times Super Tuesday figures have a margin of error of four percentage points for the Democrats and five points for the Republicans. Another survey, this one in the 14 Southern or border states that hold primries or caucuses on Super Tuesday, suggested <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> holds a 2-1 lead over <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. On the Democratic side, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> were running roughly even, the <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> survey suggested. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> by a 51-26 margin, with former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was third with 11 percent. Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trailed with 3 percent and 9 percent were undecided, the poll indicated. The pollsters contacted 423 likely Republican voters Feb. 17-19, and the margin of error was 5 percentage points, the news service said. Among Democrats, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had 22 percent and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 19 percent _ within the poll's 4 percentage-point margin of error. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> each had 14 percent, with 21 percent undecided. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> had 6 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> poll indicated, and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> had 5 percent. On the Democratic side, 597 voters were surveyed.

<TEXT>
 A senior official of the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> is angered by a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> charge that `` systemic corruption'' in his government is undermining a combined campaign against illicit drug trafficking there. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adderley </PERSON>, attorney general of the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, also disputed recent testimony of an admitted marijuana smuggler that he paid Prime Minister <PERSON> Lynden </PERSON> <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> millions of dollars to protect operations in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> country. `` What offends us the most is the judgment that if it were not for corruption and indifference in this country, the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> would not and could not be used as a transit route for the smuggling of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> cocaine and marijuana to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Adderley </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing Monday. `` If the corruption and indifference that is perceived were to magically disappear, the rate of smuggling might not diminish at all simply because I regret to say the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not put the personnel, equipment and operating funds into doing what needs to be done in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>,'' he said. He said it was `` untrue, unfair and distorts the real facts'' to suggest that the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> is not doing enough to halt the flow of 60 percent of the cocaine and marijuana that enters the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> through his country. But Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said he still might vote to deny further <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance to the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> deals with the question of drug interdiction efforts by foreign countries in the next few weeks. `` We already have too much rhetoric and empty promises,'' <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wrobleski </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for international narcotics matters, combined criticism with praise for the <ORGANIZATION> Bahamas </ORGANIZATION>' impressive narcotics seizures and cooperation with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities She said the joint interdiction of 24,860 pounds of cocaine and 146.5 tons of marijuana in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> last year was `` not equaled in any other country in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>.'' Nonetheless, she said: `` Narcotics-related corruption remains a serious problem in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. The Bahamian government has not dealt effectively with systemic corruption, which continues to make the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> attractive to drug traffickers.'' <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., questioned <PERSON> Adderley </PERSON> closely about <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> marijuana smuggler <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Baron </PERSON>'s testimony last week at the drug trial of Colombian cocaine kingpin <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> said he paid <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> $ 3 million to $ 5 million from 1979 to 1981 in exchange for <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> protection for his <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> also quoted <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> as saying he himself had paid <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> $ 200,000 a month in bribes. <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> said he once paid <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> $ 400,000 at a gambling casino on <LOCATION> Paradise </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> in the fall of 1980, which <PERSON> Adderley </PERSON> said was `` a totally incredible story, an unbelievable story.'' <PERSON> Adderley </PERSON> said he intended to investigate <PERSON> Baron </PERSON>'s allegations. But he also said that for <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> to accept a bribe in a crowded casino `` would be like the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> taking a bribe in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.''

 A World War II bomber pilot whose promised medal and promotion were forgotten when he was shot down 43 years ago has finally received the honors. `` I'm not angry about anything,'' said <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON>, 66, associate professor emeritus of cell biology and anatomy at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` I could n't be more happy because I did n't know anything at all about it, that I was supposed to get it.''

In January 1945, <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> was a 23-year-old first lieutenant who already had flown 24 missions and was slated for the medal and promotion when his B-17 bomber was shot down near <LOCATION> Neuss </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON>, the only survivor of nine crew members, was taken prisoner and held until <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s surrender three months later. He then returned to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, his hometown. At the time of the crash, however, he was presumed dead by the military and his awards were forgotten, military officials said. At a reunion in 1986, <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> met retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, who led <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON>' squadron, the 603rd of the 398th bomb group. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> told <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> about the medal and promotion, which the colonel had recommended at the time, and encouraged him to apply for them. `` The honor that has been bestowed on me today is a high point in my life,'' <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> told about 80 relatives, friends and military personnel in a 15-minute speech. <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> and the widow of the American commander who died in the crash will travel with others in the 398th to tour the bomber group's old base in <LOCATION> Nuthamstead </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, later this year. He said they will visit a cemetery in <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> where the remains of the dead crew members are buried, then <LOCATION> Neuss </LOCATION>.

 Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> says Democratic presidential rival Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> has made `` wholesale changes in dozens and dozens of key positions,'' but <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> claims it is <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> who has reversed himself on a dozen issues of prime importance. The bickering between the two Democratic hopefuls turned up a notch on Monday with <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s campaign laying down a list of what it said were 12 major <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> position changes. `` It's hypocrisy,'' said <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s attacks. But <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> kept up his volleys, saying the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman votes one way in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and is telling the voters something different. The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator said <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s `` whole approach to the electorate is in contrast to the approach during his career in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' And <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Arlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Schardt </PERSON> took aim at the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> campaign's depiction of <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> position changes. `` It's misleading and an almost laughable list,'' <PERSON> Schardt </PERSON> said. `` It reveals their anxiety about being so deeply in debt and about seeing <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> surging past them'' in recent polls. On the politically explosive issue of abortion, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s aides said <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> voted in 1984 for legislation that would have defined a fetus as a `` person'' from the moment of conception _ a change in the law that has been key goal of the anti-abortion movement. On Sunday, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> denied voting for such an amendment. `` No, no, I did not,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press.'' `` I have never supported restrictions on the ability of the woman to make a choice in having an abortion.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s staff said the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> campaign is describing the vote incorrectly. They say it was a vote designed to deny the use of federal funds for abortion _ a longtime <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> position _ and not an attempt to write the definition of a fetus into the law in such a way that would deny women the right to choose abortions. The <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> campaign also listed four other times it said <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had voted on both sides of the abortion issue in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` I have not changed my position at all,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said Monday. `` There is no inconsistency at all.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> has been severely criticized for backing down from his strong opposition to abortion, a change that came as he was planning his bid for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination. The <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> sheet also said <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> voted for the <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON> amendment to the agriculture bill in 1985, which <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> aides said contained production controls almost identical to the Harkin-Gephardt farm bill. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> now attacks the Harkin-Gephardt bill. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said Monday that the 1985 amendment was `` the only alternative'' to the Reagan-sponsored farm bill and he said the measures are different. On Sunday, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> termed the latest bill `` the worst single idea of campaign'88.'' There are ten other issues on which the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> campaign said <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had flip-flopped. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> aides said the list misconstrued vote after vote. Here are the ten: _ Balanced budget amendment: <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> statement says <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> voted against it in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 1982 and for it in 1986 in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. _ Non-lethal Contra aid: <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> release says <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> voted against such aid in 1985, but now says he favors it. _ MX missile: <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> statement says <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> voted for the MX in 1983, but now says he is against further MX funding. _ Defense policy: <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> release says <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> voted for the nuclear freeze in 1983 and was `` a respected advocate for the liberal peace agenda.'' Now <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> campaign says <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> `` positioned himself as a defense hawk.'' _ Grain embargo against the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>: <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> release says <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> voted against ending the embargo in 1980, but not criticizes embargo. _ Oil import fee: <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> statement says <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> voted against it in 1980, 1985 and 1986, but told <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> voters in 1987 he would consider one. _ Gramm-Rudman: <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> release says <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> voted for it in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and then against legislation that would have rewritten the law to solve constitutional questions raised by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. _ Trade: <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> statement says <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> declared himself a `` free-trade purist'' in 1987, but had previously voted for a textile protection bill. _ Litmus tests: <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> release says <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> denounced litmus tests of special interest groups, but that he pledged to the National Women's Political Caucus in August 1987 he would name women to 50 percent of his presidential slots. _ Supreme Court: <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> statement says <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> quickly came out against the appointment of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> as Chief Justice, but that <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was the last senator to announce he would vote against the by-then-doomed nomination of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> to the high court.

<HEAD>TV Station Stops Falwell's Program For Unpaid Bills</HEAD>

 Two independent television stations say <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> owes them thousands of dollars from his TV ministry, but a spokesman for the evangelist says checks are in the mail. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Liff </PERSON>, general manager of WPGH-TV, said he was pulling <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>'s weekly `` Old Time Gospel Hour'' from the station's schedule because of unpaid bills `` in the neighborhood of $ 50,000. `` He's flying around in his private plane and he has n't paid us since October,'' <PERSON> Liff </PERSON> said Monday. <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> also owes an undisclosed amount of money to WPTT-TV, according to general manager <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON>. The station, which carries <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>'s daily program, temporarily dropped the show four years ago for nonpayment, <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Oma </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradner </PERSON>, who handles <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>'s television accounts for the <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pate </PERSON> advertising agency, said late Monday a check was mailed to both stations on Friday. He said he did n't know the amount of either check but said `` it was a pretty good bit.'' <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMoss </PERSON>, said the checks were delayed because `` audience support for the program in the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> area has been slow for the last few months.'' `` I can understand they're upset but I would also hope they would continue to carry the program,'' <PERSON> DeMoss </PERSON> said. `` I know they made some strong remarks. But they'll be glad to know we're flying around in the private jet a whole lot less this year than last.'' <PERSON> Liff </PERSON> said he's also bothered by the fact that such shows can be an important source of revenue to television evangelists, who must pay stations to carry their programs because they do not sell advertising on them. `` We are the vehicle that broadcasts these shows to people who send in a whole lot of money, possibly at the expense of their own well-being. That's my problem,'' he said. WPGH continued to run <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>'s show without being paid `` because we did n't have a viable alternative,'' <PERSON> Liff </PERSON> said. `` There's very little this station could run at 11 p.m. on Sunday night that's going to make us money.''

 Republican presidential contender <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> have invested the most cash in efforts to get a boost from the so-called gateway states leading into the Super Tuesday series of primaries, financial records show. These states have been somewhat overshadowed by the 20-state showdown that will occur on Super Tuesday, but the campaigns generally agree that whoever does well in the gateway states will have the look of a winner going into the critical March 8 contests. The gateway contests, occurring between now and Super Tuesday's mega-primary on March 8, are in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, the senator from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, spent more than twice as much as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and their Republican rival <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> in the gateway states, according to campaign financial statements filed over the weekend with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leads the Democrats in spending for both Super Tuesday and the gateway contests, the records show. He also had the biggest bank account at the beginning of this month, $ 4 million, while the next nearest Democrat, Sen. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, had $ 2 million. The new reports reflect spending through the end of January, while not reflecting the sizeable expenditures this month on the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> contests or the subsequent spending toward Super Tuesday and the gateways. By the end of January, the reports show, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> spent a total of $ 786,529 in the gateway contests, compared to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s $ 389,150, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s $ 373,105 and Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s $ 183,831. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s biggest spending was in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, $ 367,097, compared to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s $ 20,927, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s $ 75,391, and <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s $ 67,994. The state holds its caucuses Tuesday. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> has selected <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> as his must-win state, and had spent $ 224,234 there by the end of January, compared to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s $ 126,151, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s $ 110,775 and <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s $ 35,681 <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s political director, <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, said Monday that his candidate will make a big push in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> to come in ahead of <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> plans a TV campaign there of $ 250,000 to $ 300,000, <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the overall fund-raising leader took a conservative approach to spending in January, spending the least among <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> contenders during the month, $ 3.7 million. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> spent the most at $ 7.9 million. Among the Democrats, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had spent $ 423,606 on the gateway states. His nearest competitors were Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, $ 89,202, and Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, $ 75,462. They were followed by Sen. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, whose gateway total through January was $ 40,681. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has focused virtually all of his attention on the Super Tuesday states, particularly the 14 in the South. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> had said last week that he needed to win either <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> to continue his campaign. He has since backed off of that statement, citing an infusion of campaign contributions that can keep him alive beyond those contests. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> spent $ 66,313 in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> through January, compared to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who spent the most there among Democrats, $ 266,418. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> had spent only $ 13,705 in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> again led the field in that state, with $ 80,989.

 Campaign money is being raised at a record pace by incumbent <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members, and more of it than ever is coming from special interest groups, according to an analysis by a congressional watchdog group. The study by Common Cause, released Monday, found that the 412 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members expected to seek re-election in November collected nearly $ 55 million last year, 28 percent more than incumbents had amassed at the same time in the last two-year <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> election cycle. Of that total, $ 24.2 million came from political action committees, the fund-raising arms of special interest groups which seek to influence <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. That figure was up 44 percent over the comparable figure two years ago, <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cause </ORGANIZATION> said, and also amounted to 44 percent of the total raised by the incumbents. `` Early returns for the 1988 election are in, and they reveal a landslide victory in the House for special-interest PACs,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cause </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON>, who is leading a fight in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for campaign-finance legislation to curb the influence of PACs. The largest <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> beneficiary of PAC giving in 1987 was <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., who received $ 223,058 from the groups That represented 51 percent of <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s total receipts in 1987 of $ 436,616. Three other <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members topped the $ 200,000 mark in PAC receipts for the year: <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>, with $ 207,846; <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., $ 207,187; and <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Frost </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, $ 200,924 Of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members expected to run again, 34 raised more than $ 250,000 last year. Topping the list of total fund-raising was Rep. <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, D-Calif., with $ 729,720, and three others topped the half-million dollar level: <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> DioGuardi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, $ 670,570; <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., $ 656,894; and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> McEwen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, $ <PERSON> McEwen </PERSON> was also the top spender in 1987, with his campaign committee spending $ 629,325. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, was second on the spending list, at $ 426,121, and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was third at 404,512. For incumbents, total cash on hand in campaign chests at the end of last year averaged $ 155,528, a 45 percent increase from the level of two years earlier.

 The state hierarchy of the Assemblies of God church Monday ordered television evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> to immediately begin a two-year rehabilitation period that will limit his preaching and place him in counseling, an official said. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> supervisor <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Janway </PERSON> announced the action, which could be modified by the national organization, after more than nine hours of meetings with <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, who was accused of sexual miscounduct and admitted Sunday to unspecified sins. `` The following action has been taken by the board of the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> of the Assemblies of God concerning evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>: We accept his confession of specific incidents of a moral failure,'' <PERSON> Janway </PERSON> said. `` Based on his detailed confession and the evidence we observed of true humility and repentance, we have offered him rehabilitation, in accordance with the bylaws of the general council and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> of the Assemblies of God,'' he said. `` Brother <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> has submitted to the terms of rehabilitation,'' he said. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> made no comment as he left the meeting. He was whisked away by guards and left in a van, later flying home to <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Janway </PERSON> told reporters that <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> will be prohibited from preaching a minimum of three months, `` except in fulfillment of present commitments involving foreign governments during that period.'' He did not elaborate. Earlier, <PERSON> Janway </PERSON> had said the regional board would report its findings privately to the general council of the country's largest Pentecostal denomination, based in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. He declined to answer questions after reading his statement, saying `` No comment'' when asked if the action announced Monday would require further action from church officials in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Stenhouse </PERSON>, assistant general superintendent of the denomination, said the action will now be referred to the executive presbytery in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> to `` be approved or sent down for modification.'' A March 29 meeting is scheduled, but `` it's possible for us to meet sooner,'' he said National Assemblies of God officials had met with <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> last week. <PERSON> Janway </PERSON> said <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> would be relieved of his duties as co-pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, but he would be allowed to return to preaching after three months. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Rentz </PERSON>, co-pastor with <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> at the worship center, earlier had said he would assume duties as chief pastor of the church. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> did not describe his misconduct Sunday in his confession, which drew gasps and tears from his congregation. An overflow crowd packed his 7,500-seat family worship center after reports that church officials had been given photographs purporting to show <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> and a known prostitute going into and out of a motel room. The evangelist flew here from his headquarters in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> on Monday for the meeting with the district presbytery of the Assemblies of God. In his announcement after that meeting, <PERSON> Janway </PERSON> said <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> would be counseled and supervised weekly by three members of the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Presbytery </LOCATION> during the rehabilitation period. He will be required to submit quarterly and monthly reports to church officials, <PERSON> Janway </PERSON> said. `` Again no doubt, much speculation and rumor will find its way into the secular media, but for the church, the body of Christ, such speculation and rumor has no place,'' he said. `` We urge <PERSON> Brother </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> and his associates to resist the request of those outside the church to respond to questions. Brother <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> has been in complete cooperation with the Assemblies of God and has pledged with work within the structure of the church,'' <PERSON> Janway </PERSON> said. The photographs allegedly showing <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> with a prostitute reportedly were given to church officials by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> evangelist <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>, who had once filed a $ 90 million suit against <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, claiming <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> had unjustly accused him of numerous affairs. `` I know they exist and they're relevant,'' <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>'s attorney <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundy </PERSON> said of the photographs The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday, quoting a source who spoke to a <ORGANIZATION> Jimmy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swaggart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> board member, that <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said he did not engage in sexual intercourse with the woman but `` paid her to perform pornographic acts.'' One church official said <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> had confessed that his sexual misconduct had continued for years. `` He tried and tried and tried through prayer and fasting and everything he could do to lick it and it beat him,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, told a <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> television station on Sunday. Cole is one of 13 denomination officials that examined <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s case last week. `` He confessed to specific incidents of moral failure,'' <PERSON> Forest </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, secretary-treasurer of the Assemblies' <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>, told <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s congregation. `` In the opinion of the officers of the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>, he has shown true humility and repentance and has not tried to blame anyone else for his failure.'' The denomination's role is limited to disciplining <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, but as in the case of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, it has no control over the television ministry. Eleven months ago, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> scathingly denounced fellow Assemblies of God evangelist <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> for committing adultery, comparing him to a cancer that had to be excised. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who resigned from his <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ministry in March after admitting to an extramarital sexual encounter with church secretary <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and being defrocked by the denomination, had blamed <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> for bringing his misconduct to light. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> had worked last summer to develop an ethics code for broadcast ministries to stem a drop-off in donations caused by the sex and money scandal at the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ministry under <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s reign. With tears streaming down his face, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said Sunday he was stepping down from the pulpit `` for an undetermined, indeterminate period of time. We will leave that in the hands of the Lord.'' He said he was cooperating with the Assemblies' investigation. `` I do not plan in any way to whitewash my sin or call it a mistake,'' he said. `` I call it sin.''

<HEAD>Gephardt Keeps Up Trade Talk Despite His Amendment's Likely
Scrapping</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Democratic presidential contender Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> is still talking tough on trade, despite the fading prospects of the trade amendment that bears his name. `` I want to turn it in the other direction,'' the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman said as he opened a two-day campaign swing here. `` First, we've got to change our trade policies so other countries treat us like we treat them.'' As an example, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> pointed to the fact a car manufactured in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> can be sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at a low price, while tariffs and taxes in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> would push the cost of a mid-sized American car in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to $ 48,000. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> recently made commercials suggesting that South Korean-made Hyundais sell for $ 48,000 here unless <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> mends its ways. The commercials, coupled with a populist push, were credited with helping him win the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses two weeks ago. `` If they bring their products here and sell them with ease, I want to be able to take our products there and sell them with ease,'' he said. `` I will demand equal trade.'' He added the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not back away from such a policy. `` Why are we selling ourselves short?'' he asked. `` Why do n't we stand up for what's right? When we stand up, -LRB- foreign markets -RRB- open up.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> is the author of an amendment to a massive trade bill that would call for mandatory sanctions against countries with big trade surpluses with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> if six months of talks fail to resolve differences. But <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> conferees working on the measure, which has been languishing, have said they will soon scrap the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> amendment in order to get the measure through. One conferee, a fellow Democrat, called the provision `` bad policy.'' As a courtesy to their colleague <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, the trade bill negotiators were expected to wait until after the Super Tuesday primaries to give his provision the heave-ho. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> also repeated his calls for a national energy policy including a fee on imported oil. `` We import as much oil today as we did in 1973,'' he said. `` We do n't have a courageous leadership or energy policy. Why do n't we stand up for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> for once and have an energy policy that is good for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>?'' On the issue of defense, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> called for a central procurement system for defense purchases and said he favored the Midgetman over the MX missile.

<HEAD>Two Years Later Key Players In Marcos Ouster Are In Disgrace</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Two years ago they were heroes _ idealistic young officers whose mutiny helped spark the revolt against <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Now they are in disgrace, victims of the revolution they helped inspire. On Feb. 22, 1986, the Reform the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> RAM </ORGANIZATION>, a clique of young officers angry over corruption in the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> military, mutinied. Their action tapped a groundswell of opposition that began after the 1983 assassination of opposition leader <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, and it led to a popular revolt backed by clergy and joined by hundreds of thousands of civilians. President <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> fled the country on Feb. 26, and President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> took office. RAM leaders such as Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> `` Gringo'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> were hailed as heroes in the finest tradition of service to the nation. But on the second anniversary of what is known as the `` EDSA revolution,'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> is in detention aboard a navy ship for his role in the Aug. 28 coup attempt that left at least 53 people dead and hundreds wounded. Two other RAM members, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Robles </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> `` Red'' <PERSON> Kapunan </PERSON>, have been detained in connection with the Nov. 13, 1986, murder of leftist leader <PERSON> Rolando </PERSON> <PERSON> Olalia </PERSON>. Officials say three other RAM officers are being sought in the killing. Late Monday, on the anniversary of the mutiny, military police prevented <PERSON> Robles </PERSON> from attending a mass organized by <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>'s wife <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> to commemorate the RAM contribution to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' downfall. He was hustled away into a jeep by military police as he headed for the church with his wife. `` In a broad historical sense, the crackdown on this group illustrates the continuing cannibalism of the ` revolution' which has already gobbled up several of its leading actors,'' wrote commentator <PERSON> Amando </PERSON> <PERSON> Doronila </PERSON> in The <ORGANIZATION> Manila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION>. `` The political landscape has changed favorably in favor of giving a little more stable base for democratic government,'' he added. `` But it is not yet time to be confident that stability will endure. The revolution has not yet run its course _ it can turn on its other leaders.'' The series of military coup plots and the strong desire among most Filipinos for civilian leadership cost the RAM faction whatever favorable image it once enjoyed among the general population. But other key figures in the anti-Marcos struggle have also been eased out of positions of leadership in the political turmoil of the past two years. Chief among them were former Defense Minister <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>, the RAM patron and leader of the military mutiny, former Executive Secretary <PERSON> Joker </PERSON> <PERSON> Arroyo </PERSON>, and former <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Ongpin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>, now a senator, was fired Nov. 23, 1986, after the government said it foiled a coup plot by officers close to the longtime defense chief. <PERSON> Arroyo </PERSON>, once Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s closest adviser, was fired last September amid charges by the military that he was a communist sympathizer, a charge the former human rights lawyer vigorously denied. <PERSON> Ongpin </PERSON>, an industrialist who helped rally the business community behind Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, was fired along with <PERSON> Arroyo </PERSON> in a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> shakeup in the wake of the August coup attempt. He committed suicide three months later, and his family said he was despondent over the rancor and bitterness within the Aquino Cabinet. Filipino commentators believe the turmoil was due in large part to the lack of political consensus within a disparate coalition which shared the goal of ousting <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> but differed widely on a vision for the country's future once the longtime strongman was gone. Monday, <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> released a letter which he said he received from <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> to mark the second anniversary of the revolt against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. `` Although there is no real cause for celebration now because our aspirations in 1986 have not yet been realized, it is well worth the time to pray and remember,'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> wrote. `` I also pray that all of us still share in the elusive dream of true reconciliation, peace and a better life for our people.''

<HEAD>US Investigating Shipment To USSR Of Militarily Useful Computer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says it is `` concerned by the apparent diversion'' to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> computer system which could help determine the best targets for nuclear missiles. Officials of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration confirmed Monday that the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> were investigating the possibility that the computer supposedly destined for <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> wound up in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` We're concerned by this apparent diversion and are working with <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> authorities to determine exactly what happened in the specific case,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>. According to a report in Monday's editions of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times, a <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, is under investigation for an alleged shipment last December 21 of a computer capable of simulating nuclear explosions to an engineering college in <LOCATION> Zagreb </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslovia </LOCATION>. The newspaper said the computer was shipped to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> by way of <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> capital, and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Creed </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said government investigators had uncovered `` an elaborate scheme to divert a high-technology computer.'' He said it was the first `` diversion that we are aware of concerning <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>.'' He declined to discuss details of the case. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law prohibits export of items with possible military application to <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> bloc nations. Other high-technology goods may only be shipped to those nations with approval of the Paris-based <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for Multilateral Export Controls, or <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION>. Disclosures last year that <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> company of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> had exported high-technology submarine technology to the Soviets in violation of <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION> regulations led to the filing of criminal charges against some company officials in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and strong denunciations of the sale from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lawmakers. Though communist, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is not officially aligned with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. High-technology shipments there do not require <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION> approval. Another <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that the complete computer system was not shipped to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` There were some things that were ready to go in warehouses that were stopped,'' the official said. The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times said the computer, made by Floating Point Systems of <LOCATION> Beaverton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, can be used by military planners to gauge the impact of nuclear explosions and to help determine optimal targets for nuclear missiles. The newspaper said that Floating Point was not a target of the investigation. <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Marija </PERSON> <PERSON> Besker </PERSON>, press counselor for the <ORGANIZATION> Yugoslav </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, said `` we have asked for a clarification from <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> on this report.'' `` But in any case, we are responsible partners in technology deals,'' she said. `` Our laws on these matters are very strict.'' In 1986, the administration investigated an alleged attempt to divert large shipments of computers and other sensitive equipment to the Soviet bloc through <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> told their negotiators Monday to draft anti-cheating and other key provisions of a new arms agreement within a month so the treaty can be signed this spring. Defense Minister <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> said the Soviets will begin withdrawing shorter-range SS-12 missiles from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> late this month as a `` display of goodwill.'' The missiles must be eliminated under the intermediate-range arms pact signed in December. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> reported progress on human rights and emigration, and professed not `` the slightest doubt'' that Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will make good on his pledge to pull Soviet military forces out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. A joint statement said progress was made toward banning chemical weapons and verifying nuclear test limits set by unratified 1974 and 1976 treaties. A report by the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, however, quoted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as telling <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stand on a chemical weapons ban `` hampers the working out of an international convention.'' Addressing a news conference about arms negotiations, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said it was `` extremely important'' to accelerate work in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> if President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> are to sign the treaty at their fourth summit, planned for May or June in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. He spoke after two days of talks with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said anti-cheating measures especially were `` an extremely important thing to get nailed down'' in a pact on strategic, or long-range, nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> told his own news conference later the meetings produced headway toward agreement to cut strategic nuclear weapons, which he said `` can be accomplished'' before the summit. Both men said their <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> negotiators were instructed to work out the key elements in time for their next meeting, March 22-23 in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> left on Tuesday for <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said, where he was to brief <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies on his visit. American officials said they hoped the new instructions would speed the negotiations. `` It's not a breakthrough; it's not dramatic; it may not make a headline,'' a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said privately, but the sides now have established that `` verification is the name of the game.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators were ordered to prepare three documents dealing with: _ Inspection of the projected 30-50 percent reduction in overall numbers of long-range bombers, missiles and nuclear-armed submarines _ How the banned weapons can be eliminated or converted into other nuclear arms that would remain legal _ Agreement, in a memorandum of understanding, to exchange information about strategic weapons as another way to prevent cheating According to the secretary, negotiators will try to resolve `` some misunderstandings'' about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> program to develop a defense system in space. The Soviets contend some tests contemplated in the `` Star Wars'' program would violate the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty. <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> said at an anniversary ceremony for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> army and navy: `` The Soviet missiles and launchers that are going to be withdrawn will be sent immediately to the sites where it is planned to liquidate them after the ratification of the treaty.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> were in the audience. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s official news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> reported last week that Soviet SS-12s in Waren northwest of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> had been dismantled, put in crates and were ready for transport back to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told his news conference a series of human rights meetings was agreed upon, the first to set for March 16. Jurists, psychiatrists and other experts will attend, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, but he did not announce where it would be held. The secretary, who gave human rights `` the pride of place'' on his agenda here, said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> promised `` flexibility'' in rules that require applicants for emigration to have close relatives abroad. `` That has been straightened out, at least for the balance of this year,'' he told reporters, adding that <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> told him `` categorically'' the only barrier to emigration is past work involving state secrets. <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> officials have given such assurances before. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the sides still were `` exploring'' the point at which involvement in classified work would cease to count against an applicant. After asserting belief in <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s intentions about <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said of withdrawal: `` The question is how, and that is what the negotiations are about.'' His reference was to U.N.-sponsored talks between <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> that resume next week in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. Key issues remaining are a timetable for the pullout and whether an interim government should be in place while it occurs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> offered to begin the the withdrawal May 15 and complete it within 10 months if agreement is reached in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> by March 15. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he wants the estimated 115,000 troops out by the end of the year, and `` I think there is a very good chance of that happening.'' Soviet soldiers entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 and remained to help the Communist government fight Moslem insurgents.

 A century-old windmill once saved from demolition by donations burned to the ground in a suspicious blaze, authorities said.

The 26-foot windmill, believed built between 1860 and 1870, was set for demolition when the private property it was on was bought about a year ago, said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Juviler </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Alley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to Save the Windmill.

 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> Director Lt. Gen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Odom </PERSON> says he had decided to leave the intelligence-gathering agency even before there were questions about whether he would be allowed to extend his tenure. `` I've served my tour,'' <PERSON> Odom </PERSON> said Monday in a telephone interview with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. `` I've extended four months beyond what the normal -LRB- three-year -RRB- turnover is.

The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today that <PERSON> Odom </PERSON>, 55, asked for the resignation to be effective Aug. 1. A Soviet scholar, <PERSON> Odom </PERSON> told the newspaper he wanted to write `` a couple of books fairly quickly, and some articles.''

 Here is the text of a memo from lawyer <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> to Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> on a proposed Iraqi pipeline: MEMO TO: EMIII FROM: erw DATE: 25 SEPTEMBER 1985 PERSONAL & amp; CONFIDENTIAL _ FOR YOUR EYES, ONLY I hesitate to provide the following information to you in memorandum form. I'm constantly torn between my own feelings of privacy and the need to provide you with information in a form which will expedite communication. The following are specific items of information which B.R. -LRB- <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> -RRB- provided to me. 1. When <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronfmann </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, he was advised to transmit a message to <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> to the effect that they would be willing to allow the flow of Soviet Jews to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> only. -LRB- You may recall my memo quite awhile ago, in which I expressed to you my own frustration at the conflict between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> American Jews and the State of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> which occurred in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. At that juncture point, there was a competition and most of the Soviet Jews, especially the best trained and younger, were coming to the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. I said at that time that this provided an excellent rationale for the Soviets to restrict the immigration. -RRB- In addition, apparently <PERSON> Mitterand </PERSON> has offered the services of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> to the Soviets for the purpose of emigration. 2. B.R. has been financing private polls for quite a long time in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on behalf of labor-Peres. They demonstrate an increasing strength for labor and the high probability of elections, no later than March 1986. 3. He confirmed the arrangement with <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> to the effect that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will receive somewhere between $ 65 - $ 70 million a year for ten years out of the conclusion of the project What was also indicated to me, and which would be denied everywhere, is that a portion of those funds will go directly to Labor. For both this information, and the emigration above, the obvious rationale needs to be kept well in mind. There is a need to provide <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> with an increasing flow of Ashkenazy Jews -LRB- from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> -RRB- to help balance the influx of Sephardic-Oriental Jews who have a natural affinity and affiliation with <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>. From the standpoint of American interests, the advantage is evident. 4. B.R. indicates that <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> emphatically indicated that the release of <PERSON> Weir </PERSON> was as a result of the efforts of the State of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and no one else. He indicated that they would also arrange for the release of the remaining six. There is a feeling that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` owes'' and that the accomplishment of this project, as outlined in my memo, is appropriate. It should be emphasized that things are seen in a totality of the relationship but that in this istance, they are uncertain and a bit frustrated as to why the U.S.G. has not more directly facilitated the accomplishment of this project when it is so obviously in the interest of everyone involved. 5. There is to be a <ORGANIZATION> OPIC </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> October 6. B.R. intends to send his representative -LRB- former Minister of <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Calderon </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> _ who is now a member of his <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Directors </ORGANIZATION> and an employee -RRB- to <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> to meet with Minister <PERSON> Taki </PERSON>, the Iraqi who is in charge of their oil entity -LRB- see my previous memo -RRB-. Apparently these men know each other very well. At that time, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> intends to comunicate to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, through <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, the private banking proposal which he is prepared to put together which would provide funds to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> as indicated in my previous memorandum. 6. The prime minister is very sensitive to the letter which he sent. He wants it returned if there's not going to be some kind of appropriate response when he comes to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. That appropriate response would clearly be a meeting with the President and with <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> which would include this project. As you saw from the letter, he also includes Secretary of State <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> and I have expressed myself as to whether or not that is appropriate. In any event, they apparently find it hard to understand why <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> is not able to comunicate to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, and to S.H. the importance of this project. N.B. I have explained to them the reluctance to become involved in the promotion of a private venture. Of course, they do n't see it in that light, but rather in the total context of the geo-politics of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. 7. There was a suggestion that I call the P.M. of the middle country to see what is happening and see if I could prod him along. I indicated I did not think that was appropriate at this moment. I also told him that I had had a brief and private conversation with <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> and had invited me to meet with him in a non-discussion. The trip to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> intervened.

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Over the past three months the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> has been struggling to implement a mandated $ 33 billion reduction of the fiscal year 1989 budget approved by you last year. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was directed to absorb a significant share of this reduction, which eventually became approximately $ 12 billion. Like many others, I have serious concerns regarding the entire budget reduction process. First, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> has been required to absorb cuts at a ratio almost twice as great as non-defense programs. Second, many defense reductions themselves have been made in the wrong areas, and without clear strategic thought. I am particularly upset with the nature of the cuts as they affect the department under my authority. `` On three separate occasions, the uniformed and civilian leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> provided the secretary of defense with proposed cuts totaling the amount required to meet the budget reduction, but which also would preserve the cherished goal of your administration to rebuild our <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to a minimum level of 600 ships. In each case, the advice of this senior leadership, concurred in by the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, was ignored. I can only conclude that the decision to reduce the level of our fleet to a point that it may never reach the 600-ship goal was motivated by other than military and strategic reasoning. During the four years I have served in your administration, I have repeatedly expressed my gratitude at your decision to rebuild the greatest <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in the world. Since I became secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> last year, I have stated just as frequently my belief that the force levels of our sea services remain minimal and must not be reduced. Even in the current budget environment, such force levels could have been maintained. Since recommendations to that effect were rejected by your secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION>, I am unable to support him personally, or to defend this amended budget during budget deliberations. Consequently, I find it necessary to resign from my position as secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. Thank you for the opportunity to have served our country during four of our nation's most critical and productive years. Respectfully yours, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>.

 In <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s best-selling novel `` Fields of Fire,'' a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War lieutenant ponders the dignity of men engaged in battle, and remarks `` it was the fight, not the cause that mattered.'' For <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, who resigned Monday after only 10 months as secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, there was always a fight or controversy, from his criticism of the service academies' admission of women in 1979 to his lashing out at <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, as he did on his final day on the job. `` This building -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- needs to be led,'' the 42-year-old <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> told reporters as he announced his departure. `` It needs leadership. It needs some vision. I'm saying that if I had a piece of advice to give to Secretary <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, it would be to spend a lot more time with the top leaders in this building.'' Furor has dogged <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> almost from the day he was sworn in as <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary on April 9, 1987. Five days after the ceremony, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> reversed a decision of his predecessor, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON>, and ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> would no longer make special accomodations for officers who wanted to play professional sports. <PERSON> Ensign </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> McCallum </PERSON>'s weekend career with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raiders </ORGANIZATION> thus ended and 7-foot-1 Midshipman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s eventual start in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basketball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> was delayed. In the same month, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> reversed a <LOCATION> Lehman </LOCATION> decision. to dismiss a board of admirals and rejected its promotion recommendations. L: ehman charged the board had improperly tried to promote nuclear submariners at the expense of aviation and surface warfare. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> took over the post of overseeing about 584,000 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> personnel and approximately 199,000 Marines amid a sea of problems, including sex scandals that had rocked the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, debate over the size of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and the role of Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> in the Iran-Contra affair. North was all too familiar to <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>. During their student days at the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Naval Academy, they fought for the brigade boxing championship. North won. A native of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> served in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> as the assistant secretary for reserve affairs on May 3, 1984. He was about to quit that job when then <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> made an offer he could n't resist _ the job as secretary of the navy. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> had served previsously on the Republican staff of the the Committee on Veterans Affairs of the House of Representatives. A 1968 graduate of the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> served with the <ORGANIZATION> 5th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> as rifle platoon leader and company commander, earning the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, the Silver Star, two Bronze Star medals for valor and two Purple Hearts. After the war, he left the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> and earned a law degree from the <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where he won the <PERSON> Horan </PERSON> competition for excellence in legal writing. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> once said, `` In my mind, I am a writer. In my heart, I am a soldier, and I always will be.'' <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> wrote three novels, including `` Fields of Fire,'' `` A Sense of Honor,'' and `` A Country Such As This,'' and a non-fiction book on military strategy, `` <LOCATION> Micronesia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> Strategy: A Blueprint for the 1980s.'' But an article for Washingtonian Magazine, `` Women Ca n't Fight,'' was his most controversial piece of writing, haunting him during his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation hearings for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s top job In the article, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> wrote that women are ruining the military academies by poisoning their ability to train men for combat. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> reiterated his opposition to committing women to combat during the hearings, but said he had accepted the change in the academies. In fact last June, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to allow female technicians aboard submarines for sea trials to test new equipment. In announcing the decision, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said the policy `` will reinforce the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s equal employment opportunity objectives of full integration of women into the civilian work force.''

 The dollar dropped in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> trading today and stock prices advanced for the ninth straight day. After opening at 129.27 yen, the dollar fell by midday to 128.65 and closed the day at 128.50, down 1.45 yen from Monday ` s close of 129.95. The dollar's fall was attributed to overnight setbacks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and strong selling pressure from foreign banks, dealers said. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, share prices closed higher at the end of Tuesday's session, led by large-capital issues such as steels and heavy industrials.

 State and local government workers received annual pay raises last year averaging 4.9 percent under collective bargaining contracts with public employee unions, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The pay increases were below the average 5.7 percent raises received by he same employees in 1986. But the workers still fared better last year than federal employees who got a 3 percent pay increase and private sector workers whose wages rose an average 3.3 percent, the department said Monday. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> noted that union contracts in the public and private sectors differ significantly. State and local governments, for example, tend to have a higher proportion of professional and white-collar workers. Union contracts in the private sector, on the other hand, often include lump-sum bonuses and cost-of-living adjustments excluded from the wage calculations and usually absent in the public sector. The figures showed that local government workers with wage increases averaging 5.3 percent outpaced state employees workers with an average 4.3 percent raise.

 Slum dwellers gathered possessions from condemned homes and rescue workers searched mud and rubble for victims of four days of floods and mudslides in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> that have killed at least 75 people. Civil defense spokewoman <PERSON> Sonia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadid </PERSON> said Monday that many poor people, who perch homes on the steep hillsides that jut up through this city of 5.6 million, were refusing to obey orders to abandon their shacks. `` They prefer to risk their lives than abandon their worldly goods,'' she said. Officials warned that torrential rains that let up Monday had loosened boulders and earth and said they expected more mudslides. `` Get out while there's still time,'' Mayor <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Saturnino </PERSON> <PERSON> Braga </PERSON> told slum dwellers as civil defense officials condemned whole hillside communities. Flash floods and mudslides have punished <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION> state since Feb. 2, killing at least 268 people and leaving more than 13,000 homeless. Rains devastated the nearby mountain resort of <LOCATION> Petropolis </LOCATION> during the first 10 days, briefly let up for <ORGANIZATION> Carnival </ORGANIZATION>, then returned late Friday to plague <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> said an <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> cold front over <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> dumped 5.1 inches of rain on Saturday alone. Normal rainfall for the month is 5.5 inches. Roads turned into raging rivers that tossed cars and carried away shanties, rubbish and stones. The rains washed out city streets, power lines, knocked down large trees and filled homes with mud. In the wealthy <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Teresa </LOCATION> hillside district, a massive mudslide tumbled onto a three-story hospital wing, killing at least 11 elderly patients and staff. More victims were expected to be pulled from the thick mud. In the working-class <LOCATION> Abolicao </LOCATION> district, firefighters continued their search for at least one more resident of a three-story building of six apartments built on a hillside that fell face forward late Sunday. Officials said 12 bodies were pulled from the concrete and twisted metal, while 16 dwellers were pulled out alive. Three television networks broadcast appeals for donations of food, clothes, medicines and mattresses to aid the nearly 9,500 city residents rendered homeless by the inundation. The homeless were being housed in schools, churches and public buildings that have been converted into shelters. Ms. <PERSON> Hadid </PERSON>, the civil defense spokeswoman, said the death toll of 75 included only bodies that had reached the morgue. `` The final total certainly will be higher,'' she said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, stressing that it opposes euthanasia, says First Amendment rights should outweigh an order that it identify the author of a mercy-killing essay. Citing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution and a state free-press law, the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> filed a motion Monday in <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to quash a subpoena from the state's attorney's office seeking the author's name The essay, titled `` It's Over, <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON>,'' was written by a resident physician who described injecting a fatal dose of morphine into a 20-year-old woman dying of ovarian cancer. It was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association's Jan. 8 edition. `` <ORGANIZATION> JAMA </ORGANIZATION>'s confidential sources are protected by the First Amendment and by the Illinois Reporters Privilege Act,'' <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> general counsel <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> wrote in a statement accompanying the motion. `` As described in our motion, the debate and controversy which the publication has generated is exactly what the First Amendment is all about. `` The <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> supports the privilege asserted by Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON>,'' the journal's editor-in-chief, `` to protect <ORGANIZATION> JAMA </ORGANIZATION>'s confidential sources, not withstanding that the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> opposes the practice of euthanasia and that <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> believes the action described in the essay in unethical,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> wrote `` Physicians and their organizations also have an ethical duty, however, embodied in the Hippocratic oath, to teach education and inform their fellow physicians,'' he wrote. `` It is to fulfill this latter obligation that the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> publishes <ORGANIZATION> JAMA </ORGANIZATION> and gives it editorial independence.'' Attorney <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> <PERSON> Minow </PERSON>, a former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> who is helping <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> represent the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>, said he did not know whether the essay's author was aware of the controversy. <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> has said he published the essay to spark debate over the issue of mercy killing. `` I expected a major reaction, but I did n't realize the extent to which the country was ready for an extraordinary response,'' <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said. `` We have clearly touched many raw nerves, and many people have been thinking about many of the diverse issues involved.'' He has said he believes the essay describes an actual event. But on Monday, he said `` the account does have enough vagueness to welcome critical analysis as to whether it happened, or happened in this way.'' Officials in the state's attorney's office have repeatedly declined to discuss the matter, as is routine during a continuing investigation. `` We're not confirming or denying that we're even looking into this,'' spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said Monday. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said a subpoena was served a week ago today.

<TEXT>
 The creators of a `` minicow'' produced near this northern town through cross-breeding and genetic engineering claim the smaller species can revolutionize cattle and milk production in the Third World. The 27 animals grazing on a ranch at nearby Tanleon are the product of 18 years and six generations of genetic manipulation. The smaller versions of the ox-like Brazilian zebu or Brahma species stand 3 feet and weigh 300 pounds. The experimenters began with a small pair of zebu that weighed more than a ton each and stood nearly 5 feet tall. `` Each generation has become about eight inches shorter than the one before it,'' says <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castrillon </PERSON>, the local rancher who has conducted the minicow experiment since its start. `` We have created a genetic work that produces almost the same quantity of milk as a normal cow, occupies much less space and uses fewer resources,'' he told a visitor. People working on the project believe the mincows will enable many densely populated, land-poor countries to start or upgrade their cattle industries. Ten minicows can graze on less than three acres of land, the area one normal cow generally requires. Those 10 minicows produce 2,970 pounds of meat, about 330 pounds more than the one big cow would. Horses and other animals have been reduced in size in other parts of the world, <PERSON> Castrillon </PERSON> said. But, he said, `` what surprised us was that the minicows are producing three of four liters -LRB- about one gallon -RRB- of milk a day, compared to the six liters -LRB- about 1.5 gallons -RRB- that a normal cow produces.'' <PERSON> Castrillon </PERSON>, whose ranch is in the fertile `` <LOCATION> Huasteca </LOCATION>'' region of north central <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, first proposed the idea to <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Berruecos </PERSON>, a geneticist at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Autonomous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION>, at a <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> conference. The rancher said he suggested doing the opposite of what animal breeders traditionally do: instead of producing bigger and heavier specimens, why not make them smaller, on the model of the bonsai trees in Japanese gardens? `` Unfortunately we have the theory and the prejudice that the bigger things are the better,'' <PERSON> Berruecos </PERSON> said in an interview in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` We want to make everything bigger, but the world is n't growing. Our project may seem like science fiction, but we are close to a world that perhaps will have to adopt these -LRB- types of -RRB- measures.'' To achieve the smaller species, experimenters selected prospective breeding candidates with small heads and cross-bred to achieve smaller offspring. In the laboratory, <PERSON> Berruecos </PERSON> works to weaken and eventually eliminate altogether large-growth genes in the herd's semen. <PERSON> Berruecos </PERSON>, who holds a doctorate from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>, claims that `` in terms of quality, our experience shows no difference in the milk or the meat.'' Field specialists from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are watching the experiments with interest. In fact, <PERSON> Castrillon </PERSON> said one American offered $ 1 million to take over the research, an offer he said he rejected. <PERSON> Castrillon </PERSON>'s ranch is home to 15 adult minicows and a dozen offspring. Another three are under care of the veterinary faculty at the national university. `` The minicows are gentle, but also very strong. They come close to you and strongly nudge your legs,'' said <PERSON> Anabella </PERSON> <PERSON> Castrillon </PERSON>, the rancher's wife. The researchers' next step? `` We're planning to cross the tiny zebus with the <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> type, which is small and the best milk producer,'' <PERSON> Castrillon </PERSON> said. He said he will continue cross-breeding until he produces the tiniest possible species with maximum productive efficiency. `` We're thinking that this species would be about 2 feet tall.''

<HEAD>Religious Broadcasters Fear Another Blow From Swaggart's Problems</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Religious broadcasters who lost financial support following last year's scandals and controversy face another potentially hard blow from the Rev. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s confession of sexual misconduct. `` My feeling is that there will be more damage, and the credibility of those of us in Christian broadcasting will be hurt a little bit more,'' <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday. `` This is not what we are about, and we have spent an inordinate amount of time dealing with these issues,'' said <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, who operates religious station WCFC-TV in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, among the nation's most widely watched television preachers, stepped down from his pulpit Sunday after confessing he had sinned against <PERSON> God </PERSON> and his family. Officials with his church, the Assemblies of God, said he had admitted to a long history of sexual problems and would be prohibited from preaching for a minimum of three months while he undergoes rehabilitation. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMoss </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Rev. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, judged the damage to television ministries to be survivable. `` I look at the example of a <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> moral failure _ that did not ruin the Democratic party or other <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidates, but it did ruin <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> DeMoss </PERSON> said. It did n't work that way a year ago. Some of the big ministries, including <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s, bled from the wounds inflicted by <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s adultery and high living in the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ministry, and Oral <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>' do-or-die appeal for $ 8 million. In the aftermath, no one sounded more cynical and disillusioned than <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>. `` You can stay more holy a lot of times watching ` <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Vice' than watching so-called Christian television,'' he said in one of his rousing sermons a year ago. `` A lot of people saw <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> as a pacesetter for doing what needed to be done in the church, so in this case it is shocking,'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said. The Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Robison </PERSON>, a TV evangelist who is seen on about 150 stations around the country, said the fear of criticism from <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> and other preachers may have led <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> to hide his own problem, rather than address it. `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> told me himself, he said, ` I wanted help, but I was so afraid of what would be said,''' <PERSON> Robison </PERSON> said early today on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Nightline.'' At <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION>, whose operations include the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> declined to speculate on the impact from <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s problems. Last year, however, he said contributions to <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> dropped 32.5 percent from April to October, and have remained flat. When <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> cut nearly 500 employees last summer, founder <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> blamed the controversies surrounding <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, had said that God might `` call me home'' if he did n't raise $ 8 million by the end of March, the month of <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s confession and resignation from <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION>'s fiscal year started April 1. `` We had to take the whole hit of that, plus the change in the talent mix for the 700 Club, plus the drop in oil prices ... plus the recent October stock market plunge,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said Monday. `` All four of those factors hit us all at once.'' The change in the talent mix involved <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s departure from the broadcast to seek the Republican presidential nomination, and the resignation of co-host <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinchlow </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> cut 145 more employees in November, leaving a workforce of 1,174, though it has also managed to expand its television programming and launch a radio service, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. <PERSON> DeMoss </PERSON> said contributions to <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>'s ministry had rebounded, but on Monday, WPGH-TV in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> announced it was dropping <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>'s program because he was $ 50,000 in arrears. <PERSON> Oma </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradner </PERSON>, who handles <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>'s television accounts, said late Monday a check was mailed on Friday. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> had a larger audience _ 1,720,000 households per week last November _ than any other video evangelist, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Arbitron </ORGANIZATION> rating service. The <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> put <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s audience at 860,000 households, second to <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuller </PERSON>'s audience of 1,189,000 for the `` Hour of Power,'' but <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> was seen on the most stations, <ORGANIZATION> Arbitron </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s audience had been 2,161,000 households last February, before the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> controversies. Between February and November, <ORGANIZATION> Arbitron </ORGANIZATION> said, <PERSON> Schuller </PERSON>'s audience dropped from 1.7 million households to 1.4 million, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>' from 1.15 million to 900,000, and <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>'s `` Old Time Gospel Hour'' from 616,000 to 495,000. Those figures are for broadcast audience only; most programs reach additional viewers on cable television. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s weekly broadcast would remain on his station at least until he sees what Assemblies of God leaders decide to do.

 House prosecutors for Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s impeachment trial have submitted a list of 41 potential witnesses, including the governor and his brother, <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> But <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s attorney <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> wrote a letter Monday saying he does not want to provide a witness list or to turn over any documentation yet.

The governor's lawyer has indicated that he may go to court in an effort to get the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> trial delayed until after the criminal trial on charges of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan. That trial was delayed on Monday until March 22. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> impeached <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> on Feb. 5 and accused him of hiding the $ 350,000 loan, misusing $ 80,000 from the governor's protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership, and trying to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat.

 Smoke-free workplaces are becoming more common as employers listen to their workers' health concerns, according to a survey. `` The injurious effects of passive smoking have been well-publicized, and people object to working in that kind of environment,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindquist </PERSON>, author of the 42nd annual Northwestern University Lindquist-Endicott Report. `` It seems to me that organizations are really trying to bend over to be accomodating to the non-smoker. There also were more firms spending money to help their employees stop smoking,'' <PERSON> Lindquist </PERSON> said Monday. His survey of 226 large and mid-sized companies found 70 percent restrict or are preparing to limit smoking in the workplace. On-the-job restrictions included permitting smoking only in designated areas, segregating workers into smoking and non-smoking areas, and equipping smokers with smokeless ashtrays. `` I was really surprised at the extent to which this had surfaced as a personnel issue,'' said <PERSON> Lindquist </PERSON> said. `` Today, smoking is pretty passe.'' <PERSON> Lindquist </PERSON> said it was the first year he had asked companies about smoking policies in the survey, which began in 1945 and is used by thousands of corporations to establish starting salaries for college graduates and review personnel trends. The 1988 questionnaire drew responses from a cross-section of major industrial and geographic sectors. <PERSON> Lindquist </PERSON> declined to identify any of the companies. In addition to the smoking regulations, the survey found: _ 38 percent of companies conduct pre-employment testing for drug use and 8 percent said they would begin such testing in the next year. _ 2.2 percent plan to begin pre-employment testing for exposure to the AIDS virus by the end of the year. _ 1 percent said they will begin pre-employment genetic testing to screen for possible diseases. _ 66 percent said they provide guaranteed reinstatement to employees who take parental leave after having a child, and 20 percent provide payroll services that allow employees to have money deducted from paychecks that is designated to pay for day care and is tax-free. <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a Chicago-based maker of acoustical ceiling tile and thermal insulation, drew national headlines a year ago when it warned its 1,300 workers to quit smoking _ at work and at home _ or face possible firing. The survey found only one company that had completely banned on-the-job smoking, but several prohibited smoking in the private offices of corporate executives, said <PERSON> Lindquist </PERSON>, Northwestern's director of placement Although 70 percent restricted smoking or were planning to do so, just 34 percent said they discussed that policy with job applicants during interviews, he said. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Merryman </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based lobbying group for the industry, said he could n't comment on the survey's findings without details about the types, locations and identities of the companies surveyed But he said the 70 percent finding `` is substantially higher than anything I've seen recently.'' For example, <PERSON> Merryman </PERSON> said, he had seen a recent scientific, random-sample survey of businesses nationwide that found 36 percent with policies on smoking.

 The sex scandals surrounding two prominent Assemblies of God ministers should not taint the more than 30,000 others in the church, of whom only a tiny number are ever disciplined, an official says. The evangelical church, which counts more than 16 million adherents worldwide and operates four colleges, is investigating the misconduct of its most popular television preacher, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>. On Monday, a day after <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> temporarily stepped down from his pulpit, church officials said he had admitted to a long history of sexual misconduct and would be prohibited from preaching for a minimum of three months while he undergoes rehabilitation. Another prominent television evangelist, the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, lost his Assemblies of God credentials last year amid charges of sexual misconduct. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> was said to have been active in uncovering that scandal and <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> accused him of plotting to take over <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>. `` Those are the only two in our whole denomination that have that kind of recognition,'' church spokeswoman <PERSON> Juleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON> said Monday. `` So people may feel that this is indicative of the Assemblies of God denomination, and that is not true. `` We have over 30,000 credentialed ministers in the Assemblies of God in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. At any given time, any given year, fewer than one-half of 1 percent are ever called into discipline.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON> said 12 areas of misconduct, ranging from doctrinal aberrations to moral failure, call for disciplinary action. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s suspension and two-year rehabilitation program must be approved by the church's Executive Presbytery in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, according to the church's by-laws, she said. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> appeared before his congregation in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, on Sunday to ask forgiveness from his family and church for an act he did not describe publicly. He said he would not return to his pulpit until the church investigation was completed.

<HEAD>Statement By Church Council Outlines Rehabilitation Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here is the text of a statement Monday night by <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Janway </PERSON>, district superintendent of the Assemblies of God, about the discipline recommended for evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>: We accept his confession of specific incidents of a moral failure. Based on this detailed confession and the evidence we observed of true humility and repentance, we have offered him rehabilitation in accordance with the bylaws of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> of the Assemblies of God. Brother <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> has submitted to the terms of rehabilitation as follows: 1. Brother <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> will begin a two-year rehabilitation period effective immediately. 2. Brother <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> will be required to refrain from preaching for a minimum of three months, except in fulfillment of present commitments involving foreign governments during that period. 3. During the time of rehabilitation, <PERSON> Brother </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> will be relieved of his duties as co-pastor of Family Worship Center, retaining the right to preach in the Family Worship Center after the period described in paragraph 2. 4. Brother <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> will receive counsel and supervision in weekly conferences with three members of the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Presbytery </LOCATION> during the period of rehabilitation. 5. Brother <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> will submit quarterly written reports to the district superintendent and monthly written reports to his sectional presbyter. Again, no doubt much speculation and rumor will find its way into the secular media. But, for the church, the body of Christ, such speculation and rumor has no place. We urge <PERSON> Brother </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> and his associates to resist the request of those outside the church to respond to questions. Brother <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> has been in complete cooperation with the Assemblies of God and has pledged to work within the structure of the church.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s rejection of a suit challenging what a <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> fundamentalist group calls godless textbooks will enable schools to get on with teaching children, an education official says. `` We've been relieved of a lot of pressure, pressure that's been on our shoulders since 1983,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Hawkins </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> school superintendent, said Monday. The lawsuit was filed that year by seven born-again <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> families, who objected on religious grounds to the list of required reading textbooks for grades 1-8. The books included passages in `` The Wizard of Oz'' and `` Cinderella,'' works by science fiction writer <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Asimov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> and anthropologist <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Mead </PERSON>. After a trial, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> ruled in 1986 that the families' religious freedom had been violated, awarded them $ 50,000 in damages and allowed their children to avoid the reading classes. But the 6th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> reversed that ruling and threw out the families' lawsuit. On Monday, the high court dismissed the families' appeal of that decision. `` At this time we have no alternative other than to accept the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling,'' said <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON>, one of the plaintiffs. Her husband, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON>, said the high court's action left fundamentalists across the country persecuted. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> <PERSON> Meade </PERSON>, another plaintiff, said: `` There are a lot of poor Christian parents who ca n't send their children to religious schools. To me that's a sad day for religious freedom in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' The president of the organization that financed the lawsuit called the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> action `` the most coercive ruling in the history of religious liberty litigation.'' `` We are confident that this dreadful ruling will eventually be overturned,'' said <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> LaHaye </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Concerned </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, in a statement issued in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> State Attorney General W.J. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cody </PERSON> praised the court action, saying, `` Any alternative disposition would have been the cause of chaos in the school system.'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said the protracted case did not particularly disturb the county's 6,800 public school students `` but as far as administrative personnel, school board members and even some teachers, it was very disruptive.'' He said making copies of records and testifying in court took time that could have been better used in teaching. The seven children involved in the lawsuit have long since transferred from to private schools, he said, adding that about 4,700 children in grades 1-8 were affected by the lawsuit. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, legal counsel for the state <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said the case never interfered with the state's selection of approved textbooks or otherwise changed operation of the department. `` The one issue that could have caused turmoil was ... whether there would be other parents who would seek to ` opt out' of reading programs in other schools,'' he said. `` None did.''

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military commander today charged <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> with destroying a civilian airliner to wreck the 1988 Olympic Games and accused communist officials of being `` criminals.'' Rear Admiral <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pendley </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> traded accusations and taunts with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> military representatives over the destruction of the plane. The two sides also accused each other of fomenting tension and preparing for war. `` I want you to tell those who are responsible for killing 115 innocent civilians that their objective, to discourage the community of nations from coming to the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Olympics, will not be met,'' <PERSON> Pendley </PERSON> said. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ho </PERSON>, the chief North Korean delegate, said the communist country had nothing to do with the attack. He charged that South Korean military authorities destroyed the plane as part of a scheme to retain power and to discredit the north. `` You are stirring up confrontation and leading the situation on the peninsula to the brink of war,'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> warned. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and other nations have charged that <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was behind the Nov. 29 bombing of a <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 over the <LOCATION> Andaman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> with the loss of all 115 people on board. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has denied it had anything to do with the attack. The wreckage of the plane was never found. The charges were made at the first meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armistice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> since the loss of the plane. The panel polices the cease-fire that ended the Korean War between north and south in 1953. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> delegation presented a videotape of a televised confession made last month in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hui </PERSON> who said she was a North Korean agent and that she destroyed the plane with a bomb as part of attempts to disrupt the Olympic Games that start in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> in September. Ms. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> rode on an early leg of the <ORGANIZATION> KAL </ORGANIZATION> flight and she and a male companion took poison when they were detained in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>. The man later died. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> and other North Korean and Chinese officials did not watch the tape and studiously stared at the ceiling or out of windows. <PERSON> Pendley </PERSON> said the confession was damning evidence that the north could not refute. `` You thought you had committed the perfect crime, but, like all criminals, you made a mistake,'' he said. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has been demanding to co-host the Olympic Games. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have rejected the demand. The <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> delegation replied with a rambling accusation charging that the South Korean government bombed the plane to frighten people into voting for the government in the Dec. 16 elections. <PERSON> Pendley </PERSON> rejected the North Korean accusations and repeated a demand that those responsible for the attack be punished and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> apologize for the incident. `` You should honestly admit this terrible act,'' he said. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> called the <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armistice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> meeting to demand the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> abandon plans for annual `` Team Spirit'' military exercises involving 200,000 men next month. It was the first <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armistice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> meeting since October. The North Korean delegates charged the exercises were preparations for an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nuclear attack and warned that the divided peninsula was being pushed toward war. `` You have nuclear war plans worked out,'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> charged. <PERSON> Pendley </PERSON> dismissed the North Korean accusations and said the exercises were lawful military activities intended to guarantee the safety of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. He said the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> had no intention of starting a war and posed no threat to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> or peace in the region. `` Team Spirit exercises will continue as long as the threat of aggression exists,'' he said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintains 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and heads the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, which represents the 16 nations that fought under <ORGANIZATION> UN </ORGANIZATION> auspices against <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> during the Korean War.

<TEXT>
 A man who fought City Hall to keep his seven-tiered tree house in his back yard can continue to use the structure as long as he makes some safety improvements, city officials say. `` I feel just fine with all of this,'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said after officials announced the outcome Monday. `` My kids feel fine that they can play in their tree house.'' <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> officials had objected to the tree house last May, saying it was unsafe and exposed the city to possible lawsuits. The dispute was taken to <LOCATION> Hennepin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION>, where an agreement was reached during a hearing in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> on Feb. 5. Judge <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> approved the compromise on Feb. 8, ruling that <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> can continue to use the structure for his children and a few friends as long as the safety improvements are made. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, 38, gained national publicity during his fight over the tree house and for a pair of 10-day jail sentences he served in November 1987 and in January for housing code violations at <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> apartment buildings he owns. The city said the agreement states that only the five <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> children, who range from age 4 to 18, and up to four other people can use the tree house at any one time. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> may not use the tree house as a business office anymore or hold any more open houses, such as one last year to solicit support in his fight with the city, the agreement said. The agreement requires <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> by June to provide the tree house ladder with safety cages and hand grips approved by a structural engineer. The structure must be inspected for safety every year and after unusually severe weather, such as winds in excess of 40 mph, heavy snowstorms and ice storms, the city said.

 <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> leaned on the table, staring at the chess board. He scratched his head, studied some more and accepted a draw. Eleven-year-old <PERSON> Josh </PERSON> <PERSON> Waitzkin </PERSON> smiled and shook the world champion's hand. This memory would last. `` Well done,'' wrote <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> as he autographed the boy's score sheet, which <PERSON> Josh </PERSON> will frame. It was a heady day for all concerned Monday as <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>, the 24-year-old Soviet hero, spent his first full day in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. And 59 even younger chess buffs got a chance to face the champ in a simultaneous exhibition in a <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> elementary school gymnasium. `` I was surprised at how long I stayed in _ 42 moves is a lot against the world champion,'' said <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuldiner </PERSON>, a freckled 10-year-old who was checkmated two hours. <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>, dapper in a gray-and-tan sweater, tan slacks and green scarf, arrived at the inner-city school smiling and joking, taking time to embrace curious students and pose for pictures. Asked how he expected to do against the children _ a routine exhibition for any grandmaster _ he laughed. `` It is not a serious competition, it is a joke,'' he said in accented English. `` It's a special exhibition for children. ... `` I will be happy if I am upset. If I am upset, they will be every happy, this is the main goal of the ` simul,' to make people happy.'' His opponents managed two draws. When <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> left, he resembled an American sports hero, working his way through a knot of admirers, signing autographs, posing for more pictures, shaking hands and ducking into a limousine. `` It's a great day for chess,'' said the champion. `` This is the beginning of the promotion of chess in the U.S.A.'' <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> said such exhibitions to spark children's interest in the game are `` a very important tradition'' in chess. `` I think it is the duty of the world champion,'' he said. `` If we get a lot of boys and girls into chess, we can hope that in the nearest future we will find a new wave of talent.'' He'll spend five days in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, playing two more exhibitions and meeting Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> on Thursday. `` I have just seen the city from the window,'' he said. `` I'll try to find some time to see something amazing. He spent Sunday evening at the <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, where he played 24 games of speed chess, winning all but one, which he drew. `` He played blitz chess,'' said club president <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellizzi </PERSON>. `` Offhand, not serious games, with some very strong players. I saw two brilliant combinations. This is <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>, this is <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>.'' Or, as 14-year-old K.K. <PERSON> Karanja </PERSON> said, `` it's like playing <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> or <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> one-on-one.'' <PERSON> Karanja </PERSON>, however, a former national elementary school champion, managed one of the two draws allowed by <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> on Monday. In most of the games, <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> moved instantly, working his way around the large square of tables. At times _ against <PERSON> Waitzkin </PERSON>, for instance _ he had to stop and think. `` I was pretty confident the whole way. I played a few inaccuracies,'' said <PERSON> Waitzkin </PERSON>, a student at <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s exclusive <ORGANIZATION> Dalton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Classes of students were led through the gym for a glimpse of <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>'s opponents ranged in age from 7 to 15, and came from such disadvantaged neighborhoods as the south <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, as well as more affluent areas of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>.

 The Ventura Freeway's dubious claim to fame as the world's busiest piece of road is not only dubious _ it's false, say transportation officials And some smog-choked motorists are unhappy about it. `` How did this happen? I appreciated its reputation even as I was caught in its snarls,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gediman </PERSON>, 26. `` It was worthwhile just sitting there because I was sort of participating in a global event.'' The stretch of freeway, also known as Route 101, through the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> may never have been the busiest, despite a listing that says so in the Guinness Book of World Records, <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> officials admitted Monday. That's because counting monitors on two other freeway stretches were out of commission for nearly five years and human guesses calculating traffic flow there were much too low, said <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an associate transportation engineer. Aficionados of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' fabled congestion should not despair, however. The busiest portion of freeway in the world has been determined to be the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Freeway </LOCATION> not far away, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. Coming in second is the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Freeway </LOCATION>. With the monitors fixed, new calculations show an average of 315,000 cars traveled on one stretch of the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Freeway </LOCATION> every day during 1987, while 300,000 cars a day were logged on a portion of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Freeway </LOCATION>, compared with only 277,000 on the Ventura. `` Any time you get over 250,000 cars per day, what's the difference?'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> asked.

 The nation's mainstream Shiite Moslem militia captured the three gunmen who kidnapped a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> officer in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> last week, security sources said today. The sources said the three gunmen are among dozens of suspects the Amal militia rounded up while searching for Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> but that the man who masterminded the U.N observer's abduction remained at large The gunmen, who were not identified, could not give their leader's whereabouts or say where <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was being held, said the sources, who spoke on condition of not being further identified. Reporters in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> last week reported that the Amal militia had detained more than 40 suspects, but this was the first indication that the three gunmen were among those held. The same sources said today that at least two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers were killed and several wounded when their armored patrol was ambushed by Arab guerrillas in the southern Lebanese village of <LOCATION> Braachit </LOCATION> at sundown Monday. It was not clear whether the ambush and kidnapping were related. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, was kidnapped south of the ancient port of Tyre on Wednesday. The security sources said the three gunmen were captured in a dragnet in the two days following the abduction. `` Among the detainees are the three gunmen who seized Col. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> and forced him into the first getaway car,'' one source said. Another three suspects who were being held monitored <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' his movements before the abduction, the same source said The source provided the information when asked for confirmation of an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> report that the three kidnappers had been captured. The gunmen were being held by <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> in Tyre and had been interrogated, but they were unable to provide useful information because their leader had kept them in the dark, the source said. The security source played down the significance of the gunmen's detention, saying the unidentified person who masterminded the kidnapping already had slipped out of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> `` The operation was a masterpiece from a professional standpoint,'' the source said. `` The mastermind used five identical brown <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> cars plus two additional getaway cars, a white <ORGANIZATION> Peugeot </ORGANIZATION> and a red Mercedes, in the abduction. The squad in each car did not know who was in the other car.'' The Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, a pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem group, released a videotape Monday in which <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> recited its demands for his release, including an Israeli pullout from a border zone in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The organization charged that <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> spy. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials denied the claim. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> heads a 76-man <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer group drawn from 16 nations that monitors border violations of a 1949 armistice signed by <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The group was attached to the 5,800-strong <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1978, when the nine-nation force was deployed to keep peace on the <LOCATION> Lebanon-Israel </LOCATION> border. <PERSON> Timur </PERSON> <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON>, the force spokesman, said the search continued for <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> today in the Tyre region, 50 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON> said 20 officers of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' observer group have been withdrawn to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> posts along the Israeli border. The kidnapping increased friction between Shiite forces vying for dominance in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. It pitted the moderate Amal, which is backed by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and is trying to rescue <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, against the extremist <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, which is loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and has declared support for the kidnappers, calling <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> a `` filthy American.'' <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is believed to be an umbrella for groups holding most of the 25 foreigners missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>'s spokesmen say a total of 42 fundamentalists have been rounded up in the Tyre region since <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' abduction. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> claims more than 150 fundamentalists were arrested by the Amal militia. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> is the ninth American missing after being kidnapped in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since March 1985. The other foreign hostages are four Frenchmen, three Britons, two West Germans, a Swede, a Norwegian, an Italian, an Irishman, an Indian and two unidentified men.

<HEAD>Soviets Promise `Flexibility' on 1988 Emigration, Shultz Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Shultz, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has promised to be more flexible in granting emigration visas to its citizens, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said after conducting two days of talks with Kremlin officials. However, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the matter of emigration was not open to negotiation. Soviet officials traditionally define emigration policy as an internal matter. To improve relations with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, however, they may have agreed privately to a more lenient look at applications. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said at a news conference Monday that his meetings with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> produced `` helpful clarifications'' on human rights. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> described humanitarian concerns _ divided families, <PERSON> Jews </PERSON> refused permission to emigrate, and free expression and practice of religion _ as the most important subject on his agenda. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, in contrast, said the meetings focused on `` the pivot of Soviet-U.S. relations'': prospects for concluding a treaty by late spring that would reduce the strategic nuclear weapons of both nations by 50 percent. He said human rights questions `` are being resolved by us more forcefully than before,'' and characterized discussion of emigration and personal freedoms as a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> initiative the American delegation welcomed. Last year 8,011 Soviet Jews were allowed to emigrate _ eight times the number granted exit visas the previous year. Jewish emigration activists in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> claim fewer visas have been issued since the December summit in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> between <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Jewish emigration reached a peak of about 51,000 in 1979, but dropped off as U.S.-Soviet relations worsened. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told reporters, `` We got some helpful clarifications, particularly on emigration policy, where we were assured there would be flexibility on applications requiring potential immigrants to have first-degree relatives abroad.'' Emigration regulations that took effect in January 1987 allow Soviets to seek reunification only with spouses, siblings and parents. Refuseniks, those denied permission to leave, complain that the new laws make it more difficult for those seeking to join grandparents, cousins and other relatives. The secretary said: `` There had been some misunderstanding about this and that has been straightened out, at least for the balance of this year. `` I'm glad that Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> confirmed quite categorically that the only barrier to emigration is past work involving state secrets.'' Soviets who have performed work considered of vital national importance, or that makes the worker privy to classified information, are routinely denied exit visas. According to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, his assistant secretary of state for humanitarian affairs, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schifter </PERSON>, had encouraging meetings with Soviet counterparts, including representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secretariat </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the visa-issuing office. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> held a news conference later and was asked whether the promised `` flexibility'' meant the year-old regulations would be revised, or the understanding was an informal one between the two governments. He responded: `` As far as the internal legislation of our country is concerned, we are not discussing these matters with the secretary of state.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> acknowledged `` reassessments'' were in progress on emigration and other policies Western officials define as humanitarian concerns, but declined further comment.

 A pit bull terrier unhappy with the smell coming from shipping crates full of Oriental statues led <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> officials to up to $ 1.8 billion worth of heroin at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, authorities said. `` It was the largest inland port seizure of heroin in <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> history,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said Monday after authorities announced the arrest of six people on drug charges. <PERSON> Spike </PERSON>, a pit bull terrier trained to locate drugs by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, sniffed suspiciously at the seven shipping crates destined for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, on <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 5, said his handler, customs officer <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> alerted superiors, and the statues were uncrated and put through X-ray machines and other scans.

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> plans to hold hearings regarding allegations that <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s top military officers have been smuggling cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to a published report.

<TEXT>
 An unemployed handyman visiting his old neighborhood was chased by a furious, crack-crazed mob and fatally shot after he was accused of being an undercover narcotics agent, police said. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, 30, was shot as he fled from the jeering crowd, according to a published report Monday. `` These people were so afraid that he was there to take their dope away that they killed him on the spot,'' police Inspector <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION>. `` They killed him because he was a stranger. It was n't his neighborhood anymore,'' <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> said. Foster once lived in the Hunters Point district but left the city in 1978 to move to <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, authorities said. He returned to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> only a few weeks before his death. Just after midnight Jan. 22, Foster got off a bus in his old neighborhood, where he was going to visit his sister, and found himself in the crowd of about 20 men and women. Some of them, police said, were high on crack cocaine, a potent and dangerous form of the drug. The same crowd had just fought police and forced officers to retreat under a barrage of rocks and bottles, investigators said. `` They were full of crack, and at least one of them had a gun,'' said <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>' partner, Inspector <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON>. `` Foster stepped right into it.'' When <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> began walking toward his sister's apartment, people in the crowd `` asked him if he was a cop,'' said <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>. `` He told them ` no' and kept walking. Then they asked him if he was from <LOCATION> Sunnydale </LOCATION> -LRB- the turf of a rival gang -RRB-, but when he said ` no,' someone in the crowd said he was lying. Then, they began to chase him,'' he said. Foster ran down the block and had nearly reached the corner when someone in the crowd fired a pistol at least four times, police said. Foster was hit once in the back and was pronounced dead at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. His killer has not been found, authorities said. `` The home he came back to was not the same one he left,'' <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> said. `` Crack cocaine had claimed his friends. As near as we can tell, he never touched the stuff, but in the end, it got him, too.''

<TEXT>
 The government's plan to have President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> address a ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s annexation by <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is becoming a major point of dispute. German troops marched into the country nearly 50 years ago, officially linking this Alpine nation with <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s Third Reich. <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> did not become independent again until 1955. Austrians are marking the annexation _ called the Anschluss in German _ as a time of reflection on a troubled period when throngs cheered <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>, Jews were harassed and resistance fighters executed. Austrian television and radio, along with many of the country's newspapers, are giving much attention to the March 11 commemoration The issue is especially sensitive because of the widely held opinion in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> that the country was a `` victim'' of the Third Reich. Now, with <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> under fire for his role as a first lieutenant in the German army in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION> during World War II, it is increasingly uncertain what the bickering coalition government will do on the March 11 anniversary. Many Austrian Socialists have made it clear they are against the ceremony during which the 69-year-old <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> is scheduled to deliver a speech. `` I have misgivings about this event,'' <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinowatz </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief and former chancellor, told reporters at a news conference Monday after a meeting of the party's leadership suggested that <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> should step down. The Socialists, senior partner in the government, adopted a resolution saying a report on <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s wartime record released earlier this month has `` badly shaken the president's moral authority at home and abroad.'' `` It has become obvious that ... Waldheim ... can not realize the most important aims he has set for himself, that is to promote domestic peace in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and to increase <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s prestige in the world,'' the resolution said. The leadership at the meeting, which included Chancellor <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON>, stopped short of asking for <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s resignation. The report on <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s wartime record presented no evidence that would clearly back allegations that he committed wartime atrocities, but it left open the question of whether he was guilty of any crime. The report, written by an international panel of historians, said he was `` in close proximity'' to some Nazi atrocities in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION>, knew they were going on and made no attempt ot prevent them. It also said <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> concealed his wartime past and tried to make it seem harmless once he could no longer hide it. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> has denied any wrongdoing. Instead of a commemoration ceremony, <PERSON> Sinowatz </PERSON> called for reflection of `` what happened on March 11, 1938, and what must be done so that such a thing never happens again.'' But Deputy Chancellor <PERSON> Alois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mock </PERSON>, a leader of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the junior member in the coalition government, rejected the idea of scrapping the ceremony and the <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> speech in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Hofburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION>. `` That's a suggestion that will never be accepted by the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Mock, <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s most vigilant public defender, at a separate news conference Monday where he spoke on behalf of the party. <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Koenig </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, urged a suspension of the political debate until after the nation commemorates the anniversary. `` I think that after the ceremonies on March 11, there must be a discussion on how to achieve greater cooperation ... among the federal president, the government and the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Koenig </PERSON> said on behalf of the party. Newspapers are giving the dispute prominent play: `` With increasing frequency, there are suggestions that the government should simply call off the planned commemoration ceremonies for March 11,'' the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presse </ORGANIZATION> said in its lead story Monday. A day earlier, Economics Minister <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Graf </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member, became the latest of several politicians to make such a suggestion. He told a roundtable TV discussion that he had made the suggestion `` out of concern about further polarization.'' `` On Account of <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, the 1938 Commemorations are on Shaky Ground,'' the socialist AZ tabloid of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> said in a front-page headling on Monday. The Socialists and the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> made plans for the <LOCATION> Hofburg </LOCATION> ceremony before the historians' report on <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s wartime past was issued. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was the conservative candidate in the presidential election. He became president with 53.6 percent of the votes in a June 8, 1986 runoff. His term is scheduled to end in 1992. In <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> the president is head of state, a largerly ceremonial position. <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> runs the government.

 Guerrillas using rocket-propelled grenades ambushed an Israeli armored patrol in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, killing two soldiers and wounding several others, security sources said today. The sources, speaking on condition they not be identified further, said the patrol of one tank and an armored personnel carrier was ambushed near the village of <LOCATION> Braachit </LOCATION> at sundown Monday. `` Both vehicles were raked with rocket-propelled grenades that set off a chain of ammunition explosions in the tank,'' said one source. `` No one could have escaped alive from the burning tank.'' The source said there were several other serious casualties in addition to the two fatalities in the ambush, but no specific figures were available. The source said the guerrillas were either Shiite Moslem fundamentalists or pro-Syrian leftists. Both groups operate in that area. The source said there was not yet enough information available to be more specific. The Israeli army had no immediate comment on the reported attack. Braachit is five miles west of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s border in an area where an Israeli `` security zone'' overlaps with the area of operations of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION>.

 <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> and rival opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> met today to discuss merging their two parties in time for the parliamentary elections, but they only agreed to discuss the issue again. The surprise, two-hour private meeting was proposed by <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> after he emerged today from two weeks of near seclusion and told reporters a merger would ensure an opposition victory in the balloting expected be held in April. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, immediately agreed to the meeting, which was held at a <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> hotel. `` We will do our best to make the opposition merger successful at any cost,'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> said afterward. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> said he was not as optimistic. No specific date was set for another meeting. Repeated efforts to reunite the two parties have failed and several rounds of talks in recent weeks have not produced any progress. Neither party indicated today that the situation had changed. On Feb. 8, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> resigned as president of the <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, purportedly to help reunite the opposition before the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> elections. The meeting was the two Kims' first since Oct. 29, when they split in disagreement over which of them should run as the opposition candidate in the Dec. 16 presidential elections. Each insisted on running, giving government party candidate <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> victory despite <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s failure to win a plurality. After the defeat, the two Kims came under strong pressure to retire from politics. Many people accused them of putting personal ambition ahead of their avowed campaign goals of ending military rule. When he quit as president of his party, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> said he had expected the rival opposition groups could agree on a merger. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> today said he believed that `` the merger of the opposition bloc is the only way to crush the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s plot to perpetuate its rule and revive democracy in this country. So, it must be achieved with the people's power.'' He said the new Cabinet formed by <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, who is to take office Thursday, is merely an extension of that of outgoing President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>. The new Cabinet includes several key holdovers from <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s administration. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> said he had a `` great deal of doubt about <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s implementing democratic reforms. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, a former general like <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, has pledged to an end to the long tradition of authoritarianism in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The governing and opposition parties, which have been squabbling over the number of lawmakers to be elected from each district, have failed to rewrite the election law and to set an exact date for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> election.

<TEXT>
 A former police officer convicted of torturing a 17-year-old boy with a 50,000-volt stun gun was sentenced to two years in prison by a judge who called his action `` a gross betrayal of public trust.'' Former Huntington Park Police Officer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lustig </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 32, was convicted in December of one count of felony assault under color of authority because of the methods used during questioning of <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>. Another former officer, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, 27, was found guilty of aiding and abetting in the crime. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> on Monday sentenced <PERSON> Lustig </PERSON> to two years in state prison and <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> to six months in county jail as a condition of three years' probation. `` In our society, a suspect in police custody has the right to be free from torture,'' <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> said. `` These acts constituted a gross betrayal of the public trust.'' `` It's an embarrassment to everyone in the community, this type of behavior,'' said Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Koller </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, who attended the hearing with his parents, said of the sentencing: `` I think it's fair. It's the law.'' He has filed a $ 10 million federal lawsuit claiming his civil rights were violated during the Nov. 30, 1986, incident. In December, jurors convicted the two former officers of using a 50,000-volt electric stun gun similar to a cattle prod to torture <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, who had been arrested for questioning about stereo components he was carrying as he walked along a street in <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburb. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> testified during the trial that <PERSON> Lustig </PERSON> used the stun gun to burn his thighs through his clothing several times during interrogation. <PERSON> Lustig </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, said his client's actions `` were not criminally motivated'' and he has endured enough punishment through the public humiliation he has had to withstand. <PERSON> Lustig </PERSON> had a `` misplaced belief that the ends justify the means in a criminal investigation,'' <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said. The attorney said he did not know whether he would file an <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadden </PERSON>, said he would appeal, and the judge agreed to stay <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>'s sentence pending the outcome, setting bail at $ 3,000.

 Conspiracy charges against a woman whose boyfriend parachuted to his death with 77 pounds of cocaine strapped to his body were dropped at the request of the prosecution. The motion to dismiss the charges against <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, was filed Friday by Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dedrick </PERSON> and approved without comment Monday by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dedrick </PERSON> declined to meet with a reporter or return telephone calls Monday. His motion to dismiss the charges came a week after he lost a battle to use against Ms. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> statements she made to a government undercover agent. The trial of Ms. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, a paralegal, on charges of conspiring with former <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> narcotics officer <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> II to import cocaine and to distribute the drug had been set to begin March 1. <PERSON> Dedrick </PERSON>'s motion asked that the charges be dismissed without prejudice, which allows him to seek another indictment. `` <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> was very happy over that, as you might imagine,'' her attorney, <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillard </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, said of the dismissal of charges. `` Hopefully, that will be the end of it.'' <PERSON> Dedrick </PERSON>'s motion did not specify why he wanted the charges dismissed, and <PERSON> Dillard </PERSON> said he would not care to speculate, but it seemed likely that the ruling disallowing Ms. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>'s statements was a direct cause. Those statements were suppressed, meaning they could not be used as evidence against her, on Feb. 12 by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murrian </PERSON>. <PERSON> Murrian </PERSON> ruled the statements `` were made in a situation so inherently coercive that they must be considered as involuntary and compelled'' because the undercover agent posed as a representative of violent Colombian drug dealers who wanted either their cocaine or their $ 12 million. <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>'s body was found on a <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION> driveway the morning of Sept. 11, 1985. He carried bags with 77 pounds of cocaine in them, and federal authorities have linked him to some 200 pounds of the drug found in duffel bags scattered across northern <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. A few days after <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>'s death, <PERSON> Kieran </PERSON> <PERSON> Kobell </PERSON>, a special agent with the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, visited Ms. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kobell </PERSON>, using an alias, and a government informant now listed as a fugitive took Ms. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> on a car ride during which, <PERSON> Kobell </PERSON> said, she revealed an intimate knowledge of the cocaine-smuggling operation and promised the deal would go through even if she had to kill somebody. During testimony in the suppression hearing, <PERSON> Kobell </PERSON> said he did not force Ms. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> to say anything during the car ride. However, <PERSON> Murrian </PERSON> also noted that <PERSON> Kobell </PERSON> threatened both Ms. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> and her attorney in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Partin </PERSON>, in a telephone call to the lawyer the next day, according to <PERSON> Partin </PERSON>'s testimony at the suppression hearing.

<TEXT>
 Nine police officers taken hostage during a violent clash with separatist rebels were freed today, and members of the dominant conservative party demanded that the separatist faction be outlawed on this French-ruled island. About 100 protesters battled French gendarmes at a hospital construction site on the east coast city of <LOCATION> Poindimie </LOCATION>, holding nine officers for about 13 hours before releasing them. Officials said 17 officers were injured during the fracas. Authorities who spoke on condition of anonymity said all the protesters involved escaped arrest. The Gendarmerie, a police force under the French military, said in a statement that at least 20 people were injured by sticks or stones in the battle and four police cars set on fire. The Rally for <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> in the Republic, a local party with close links to French Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s Rally for the Republic party, adopted a resolution today calling on Overseas Territories Minister <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> to dissolve the separatist <ORGANIZATION> Kanak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. Dissolution would make the party illegal. The resolution also called for party leaders responsible for the clash to be expelled from the island. <PERSON> Yewene </PERSON> <PERSON> Yewene </PERSON>, a separatist leader, said the resolution showed `` a logic of intolerance, a policy of contempt and a desire to humiliate the Kanak people.'' <PERSON> Yewene </PERSON> said the protesters did not object to the building of a hospital, but not at the site chosen, which he said was vital to the local <LOCATION> Tieti </LOCATION> tribe. The Kanak group supports independence for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>, a territory of 145,000 people about 1,100 miles east of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. In a referendum last September, a majority voted against independence. The Kanak front boycotted the election, saying immigrants who arrived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> in the past three years should not have been eligible to vote. Kanaks make up 42.6 percent of the population and Europeans 37.1 percent. Other nationalities make up the rest. Regional elections, which the separatists say they will boycott, are scheduled for March.

 Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> is asking the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to investigate charges that the agency provided personal data to Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> about <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. In a letter to <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said he had received reports that the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> had provided similar information on other senators to officials in other foreign countries. The <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> said maintenance of files on members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would be `` illegal and improper.'' The transfer of such information to another government would `` call into question the integrity'' of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence institutions, <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> wrote. The letter, a copy of which was made available to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, was sent to <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> following testimony by <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> associate turned critic of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s defense chief <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON>, testifying before a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on Feb. 9, said the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> passed to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> data about <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., and two of their aides The senators have been among <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s strongest critics on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, citing allegations of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s involvement in drug At the time of <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON>'s testimony, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> said it `` categorically denies'' his allegations. A <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, had no comment Monday on <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>' letter except to say that communications from members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are confidential but are taken seriously and responded to. <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON>'s testimony reinforced the notion that the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> had maintained close ties with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> despite strong evidence dating back several years that he was involved in drug trafficking activities. Two federal grand juries have indicted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on drug related charges. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> has said it was `` unconscionable that the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> knew about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s drug trafficking activities and continued to work with him for such a long time, but it is even worse to think that the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> would provide information about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s leading American critics to the general himself.'' <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON> spent Monday at <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> with prosecutors investigating the Iran-Contra affair. Although no details were provided, <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON> presumably was questioned about his testimony that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> agreed to provide training for Nicaraguan Contras after receiving a request from former White House aide Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> in 1985. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, in a separate letter to <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON>, asked if the agency had ever passed on data about members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or their staffs to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and whether it had engaged in wiretaps or surveillance on him or members of his staff. In his letter to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> asked whether the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> had maintained information on members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or their staffs and whether such information was ever passed on to any official of a foreign government, specifically the Panamanian Defense Forces. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> indicated he was skeptical about the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s denial, contending that it made an inquiry afterward to <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> field offices and to the heads of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agencies involved in national security issues as to whether the denial was accurate. Ms. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> said she was unable to comment on that allegation. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> not to rely on <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> files because the information alleged to have been passed on may have gone through a `` back channel'' without files being maintained. `` It is imperative that an internal investigation be conducted and all employees in contact with <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> government or military officials be questioned,'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> wrote.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> today without a firm timetable for a Soviet pullout from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence sources said the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is taking initial steps to leave. Soviet troops are retreating to defensive positions and dependents are being withdrawn, a solid sign the soldiers will not be far behind, a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. In addition, soldiers in the 115,000-man Soviet force are not being replaced when they complete their tours of duty, said the official, who briefed reporters on <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s flight to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Monday at the end of two days of talks in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that he did not have `` the slightest doubt'' the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> would depart. And after briefing <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> today, he reaffirmed his expectation the Soviets would quit <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. But he evidently did not get a specific timetable from Soviet Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> or Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. The garrisoning of Soviet troops and departure of dependents is `` solid evidence'' the eight-year military intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> will soon end, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. On Feb. 8, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> offered to begin the pullout May 15 if <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> reach a settlement by March 15 in negotiations due to resume in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> next week. He said the withdrawal could be achieved within 10 months. The Soviets have, however, accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of obstructing a settlement by insisting an interim coalition government be created in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to prevent the protracted civil strife <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> says would otherwise ensue. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has said such a government could facilitate the troop withdrawal and return of about 3 million refugees from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. But another senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> does not endorse <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s position. Referring to the anticipated withdrawal, the official told reporters: `` We would n't want to miss the bus. We've been trying to get the Soviets out for years. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> would not make the composition of the government it leaves behind a condition of withdrawal. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> stopped at <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> today to brief the Western allies, who were especially interested in the steps taken on arms control. From Brusssels, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was flying back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for a 26-hour respite before heading for the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> try to push Arabs and Israelis into negotiations. `` I do n't think many people give me much chance,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said with a smile. But, he added, `` Even if the chances are small, it's worthwhile trying. Also today, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, to brief <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact foreign ministers, the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. On Monday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators were directed to prepare within a month three draft agreements for a treaty to reduce long-range, or strategic, nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 50 percent. Such missiles have a range of more than 3,400 miles. The drafts will deal with verifying compliance with the cutbacks, disposing the weapons, and exchange of information. They are to be ready for the next Shultz-Shevardnadze meeting, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on March 22-23. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> that the two sides were still far apart on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Strategic Defense Initiative. `` I think we moved it a little bit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, maybe imperceptibly,'' he said of the disagreement over the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> program to develop a space-based defense against ballistic missiles. On human rights, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> persuaded the Soviets to drop for the rest of the year, at least, a requirement that Jews who want to emigrate have a close relative living abroad. A senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who demanded anonymity, said about 90 percent of Jews who have applied for exit visas do not have close relatives in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In the past several months, the official said, the Soviets for the first time provided the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with figures on applications waiting to be processed. On Feb. 1, he said, there were 1,042 on file. Soviets who have performed work considered by the government to be of vital national importance or that involved classified information are routinely denied exit visas. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told a news conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Monday that he gave a `` good mark'' to the two-day talks with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, that they had moved the two sides closer to a strategic arms agreement and a spring summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. No specific date for a fourth summit between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was agreed to, but <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> told reporters Monday that both sides want the summit in late May or early June. Defense Minister <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> said Monday the Soviets will begin withdrawing shorter-range SS-12 missiles from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> late this month as a `` display of good will.'' The missiles must be eliminated under the intermediate-range arms pact signed in December. Such missiles have a range of about 300 to 3,000 miles.

Nineteen people were undergoing treatment at the <ORGANIZATION> Pirogov </ORGANIZATION> emergency aid institute in <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> repoted, adding two of them were in `` severe'' condition.

<TEXT>
 The cost of living the high life in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> rose last year at more than twice the rate of the Consumer Price Index, with Beluga caviar showing the most increase, according to a champagne producer's survey. Whereas the CPI rose 4.4 percent last year, the life of luxury in the nation's most expensive big city went up 9 percent, according to the `` Moet Index.'' The survey has been compiled since 1983 by <PERSON> Moet </PERSON> and Chandon Champagne. Largest increases included: 14.7 percent for 30 grams of Beluga caviar, up from $ 29 in 1986 to $ 33.25 last year; 11.7 percent for a wash, cut and blow dry at a top hair salon, from $ 60 to $ 67; and 10 percent for a day's maid service, from $ 80 to $ 88. Luxuries with lower price hikes included: 3 percent for a round trip <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-Paris </ORGANIZATION> flight on the Concorde, up from $ 4,296 to $ 4,424; 4.8 percent for a full-length mink coat, from $ 15,750 to $ 16,500; and 5.3 percent for a limousine rental, from $ 38 an hour to $ 40 an hour. It was the fourth consecutive year the Moet index exceeded the CPI. In 1986, the index rose 6.1 percent, while the CPI rose only 1.9 percent.

 CBS plans to launch a late-night talk show with `` Wheel of Fortune'' host <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Sajak </PERSON> next season that would compete with <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Tonight Show Starring <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>.'' Meanwhile in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday it is launching `` Later with <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Costas </PERSON>'' in August, a half-hour talk show that will follow `` Late Night with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>.'' The <PERSON> Sajak </PERSON> show means cancellation of the network's late-night lineup of action shows and music, said a source at <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>. The shows are expected to remain on the air until at least September, said the source, who is close to the productions and spoke on condition of anonymity. They include the original series `` Adderly,'' `` Night Heat,'' `` Diamonds'' and `` Top of the Pops'' and reruns of `` Hunter.'' `` At least 20 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> affiliates are not carrying the late-night shows,'' the source said. `` CBS is turning to <PERSON> Sajak </PERSON> in hopes of finding a format all its affiliates will stay with.'' <PERSON> Sajak </PERSON> is host of `` Wheel of Fortune,'' the most successful syndicated show ever. CBS Entertainment President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> LeMasters </PERSON> said recently he wanted the network to increase its late-night visibility with a talk show and confirmed that the network was talking with <PERSON> Sajak </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sajak </PERSON> also discussed the possibility of a CBS talk show recently when he was a guest on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Late Night.'' The Costas show would be a half-hour addition to <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s schedule, following `` Late Night.'' Costas is a sportscaster with <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, but his show would feature interviews with people `` from all walks of life,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said. The show will originate from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, except in the summer when it will be based in Costas' hometown of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sajak </PERSON>, host of both the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> daytime version and syndicated nighttime version of `` Wheel of Fortune,'' is expected to leave the daytime show sometime this year, though he will stay with the nighttime show, said <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorce </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for King World, which distributes `` Wheel'' for syndication.

<TEXT>
 A 16-year-old boy has been arrested in the deaths of his parents, whose bodies were found buried in a shallow grave in the family's back yard, authorities said. A neighbor told police that the boy's father had recently shown him a drawing by his son depicting a man with an ax in his head. The boy reportedly told his father, `` That's what I feel like doing to you.'' The bodies of <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Overhand </PERSON> were discovered about midnight Sunday by police who went to the residence to check out confidential information they had received. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Overhand </PERSON>, 16, the couple's only child, was being held at the <ORGANIZATION> Juvenile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Bernalillo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said A second 16-year-old youth, whose name was withheld, also was taken into custody. No charges have been brought against the two. The Overhands, who were believed to be in their mid-30s to 40s, were killed between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. Thursday, probably while they slept, said Sheriff's Capt. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Houston </PERSON>. An autopsy indicated <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Overhand </PERSON> was shot with a .38 - caliber handgun, <PERSON> Houston </PERSON> An autopsy had not been completed on Mrs. Overhand Monday night, but <PERSON> Houston </PERSON> said she also appeared to have been shot. Four handguns were seized as evidence, but authorities would not say where they were found or to whom they belonged. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, a neighbor, said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Overhand </PERSON> told friends his parents were in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for the weekend attending his grandfather's funeral. Sheriff's department spokeswoman <PERSON> Ronni </PERSON> <PERSON> Crago </PERSON> said police received information that `` something of a suspicious nature'' had happened at the Overhand home in a subdivision on <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> Police obtained a search warrant and found the bodies, she said. C.D. <PERSON> Youngblood </PERSON>, who lives next door to the Overhands, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Overhand </PERSON> spoke to him often about problems he was having with <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. Overhand, <PERSON> Youngblood </PERSON> said, recently told him of finding a drawing in the garbage depicting a man with an ax in his head. When <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Overhand </PERSON> confronted his son with the drawing, the younger Overhand said, `` That's what I feel like doing to you,'' <PERSON> Youngblood </PERSON> recalled. Mitchell Overhand, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said, spent the weekend with friends and had attended a party Friday night at an <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> hotel. He said the boy also had invited a number of friends to his home over the weekend. <PERSON> Youngblood </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Overhand </PERSON> told him his son hated him so much, `` he would n't be surprised if he tried to kill him.''

<TEXT>
 A member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said today that the resignation of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> will force <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to take a closer look at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget and the future size of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think what his resignation will do will cause us to look at our commitments,'' Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, said on `` CBS This Morning.'' `` Can we, in fact, afford to keep the commitment that we've made without spending the money necessary to put out a fleet to do it?'' The senator later added that <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s decision `` may spur very critical analysis of exactly where we're going with the defense budget.'' <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, in announcing his resignation Monday, said he quit because <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> made budget decisions that mean the target of a 600-ship <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> will never be met. `` The resignation ... may be right for him but a bit premature for us,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. `` After all, Secretary <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> has to come before <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, present the budget. `` We might disagree. We might agree with Secretary <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> that perhaps the allocation of the cuts should not have come out of shipbuilding, perhaps they should come out of some other service or some other way of achieving those cuts,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. In 1981, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> promised to build the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to a total of 600 deployable ships from the 450 the service had at that time. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> was given large increases for shipbuilding as part of the record military spending buildup in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first term. Although overall defense spending has slowed sharply during the last three years, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> shipbuilding continued to grow, although more slowly. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials had said they would meet the target by next fall, but <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> ordered the service to mothball 16 aging frigates, leaving it with 580 ships. The <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary ordered the cuts as part of a package of $ 33 billion worth of reductions <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> had to find under an agreement reached by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to cut federal spending. Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., said Monday that <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s decision `` has obviously launched an important new stage of the debate about <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> priorities and the size and type of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> we need Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., said, `` I never believed that there was anything magic about the number 600. While <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> ordered 16 older ships cut, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s budget includes money for 17 new ships. Among them are one missile-firing submarine, two more 688-class attack subs, the first of a new class of `` Seawolf'' attack subs, and three destroyers. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> declined to respond Monday to <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s criticism, but he noted last week that he had to make `` tough choices'' in cutting the budget.

<HEAD>China's Economy Grows, But Rising Prices Hurt Many</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economy grew by a robust 9.4 percent in 1987, but rising prices caused by high consumer demand lowered living standards for one out of five city dwellers, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> said today. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s gross national product for the year was $ 295 billion, ranking it seventh in the world. The report said industrial output was up 16.5 percent, while agriculture output increased 4.7 percent. The bureau, in an annual report, said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 200 million urban dwellers made an average of $ 248 last year, up 10.6 percent before inflation. Its 800 million peasants averaged $ 125 each, up 5.3 percent. But <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhongqi </PERSON>, director of the bureau's comprehensive statistics department, also said at a news conference that a nationwide survey showed 21 percent of urban households had less to spend last year because of an 8.8 percent rise in the cost of living index. He said retail prices rose 7.3 percent nationwide, compared to about 6 percent rise in 1986. In the cities, however, inflation hit 9.1 percent. He said the main factor was the inability of the nation's producers, particularly of food and consumer goods, to meet the growing demands of a more affluent society Meat, poultry and egg prices climbed 16.5 percent, and fresh vegetables and aquatic products rose about 17 percent. Pork and sugar were rationed for the first time in decades in many cities because farmers, discouraged by rising prices for raw materials, cut back production. Wage earners who received no salary raises and retirees on fixed incomes suffered the most from the price spiral, he said. <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> said the government was trying to overcome supply-demand imbalances by promoting production of non-staple commodities, controlling excessive investment that has led to an overheated economy and subsidizing some prices where consumers and producers are particularly hard hit. He said 10 percent of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s urban residents were economically distressed, defined as having an annual income of less than $ 108. In rural areas, 8.2 percent, or about 60 million people, were under the poverty line of $ 54 a year. <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> said poor people in the countryside fell from 80 million in 1986, but he gave no comparative figures for the urban poor. <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> said unemployment hovered around 3 percent in 1987. He said underemployment _ millions of workers in factories and offices with little or nothing to do _ was an even more serious problem. The Chinese government has acknowledged that inflation, unemployment and income disparities are all problems that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will have to live with as it adjusts from a rigid central planning system to a state-controlled but increasingly decentralized market economy. Among the strong points were the nation's foreign trade, with exports rising 27.8 percent to $ 39.5 billion. The trade deficit fell from $ 12 billion in 1986 to $ 3.7 billion last year. It said new foreign investment in 1987 totalled $ 7.57 billion, up 4.3 percent, of which $ 5.33 billion was from borrowing and $ 2.4 billion from direct investment.

 `` The Vampire,'' a painting by Norwegian artist <PERSON> Edvard </PERSON> <PERSON> Munch </PERSON> that was insured for $ 2.3 million, was stolen today, the <ORGANIZATION> Munch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> reported.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> citrus growers have filed suit in federal court to prevent <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> from enforcing its emergency quarantine of the fruit. The suit called the Feb. 11 quarantine unconstitutional and invalid. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON> said he had ordered the 30-day quarantine on fruits and plants to protect <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' $ 65 million-a-year citrus industry from the canker which had infected some <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> citrus groves.

 <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> received an honorary knighthood from Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> today, the highest royal honor <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has bestowed on an American. The brief, private ceremony at Buckingham Palace did n't mean the former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense secretary would become Sir <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON>. That accolade is reserved for the queen's own subjects. But it was <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s way of saying thanks to an exceptionally good friend. Asked why he got the knighthood, <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> modestly replied: `` I have n't the faintest idea.'' But the announcement Feb. 1 cited his `` outstanding and invaluable contribution'' to Anglo-American defense cooperation, and his `` unfailing support and assistance'' during the 1982 Falkland Islands War between <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. The 70-year-old <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, who counts <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> among his heroes, did not have to kneel before the queen as a commoner and be tapped on both shoulders with a sword, as is the custom for British subjects. `` Her Majesty was nice enough just to present it to me.'' he said, adding: `` I'm very honored, very pleased, and still very astonished.'' He received a red ribbon with the badge of the Order of the British Empire, and a separate silver star signifying the title <ORGANIZATION> Knight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> _ the highest order of chivalry for a foreigner. It means he can now call himself <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> GBE. <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, wearing a gray suit, was accompanied by his wife, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>, and Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, who had recommended him for the honor. The 25-minute ceremony was held without reporters or photographers present in the small, blue-walled Queen's Audience Room where the 61-year-old monarch often receives official visitors. `` She was very gracious as always, and very generous in her remarks,'' <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> told reporters afterward. He politely avoided mentioning what they discussed. He carried his new insignia in a blue presentation box which he opened for photographers just before driving away to a luncheon hosted by <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> II. When <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>'s award was announced, reporters asked him whether he was ready to be called `` Sir Cap.'' He replied: `` Good God, no. Our constitution has some harsh words about titles. But I really am flattered.'' Asked after the ceremony whether he was now more of an Anglophile, he replied: `` well, it's hard to be not.'' <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> retired Nov. 5 after nearly seven years as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s defense chief. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> provided critical intelligence and logistical support to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> during its 74-day campaign to oust <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s invasion force from the British-ruled <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> islands <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> insisted Monday that his role was `` a comparatively modest, small one.'' Buckingham Palace said only a very few of the 55 other Americans who have received honorary knighthoods were made GBEs. The most famous Americans who have received honorary knighthoods were made Knights of the British Empire or KBEs, a lower order of chivalry. They include former Secretary of State Dean <PERSON> Rusk </PERSON>, industrialist <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, philanthropists <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellon </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Getty </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, actors <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairbanks </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Poitier </PERSON>, former Sen. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulbright </PERSON>, D-Ark., and food magnate <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> II American-born violinist <PERSON> Yehudi </PERSON> <PERSON> Menuhin </PERSON> also received an honorary KBE, but his award was changed to a full knighthood after he gained dual British-U.S. citizenship in 1985, and he is now known as `` Sir <PERSON> Yehudi </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> has longstanding links with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and has visited often, finding strong support from Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s military buildup at home and his drive to modernize <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and keep it unified. The Anglo-American relationship, he said, is `` critically important'' to the Western alliance. <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> gave up an invitation to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last November to make his debut as a British television commentator on the treaty eliminating medium - and shorter-range nuclear missiles, which he helped secure _ and had some candid assessments of the Soviet leadership Last month, he was appointed a distinguished visiting professor at <ORGANIZATION> Edinburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where he will spend four weeks this summer participating in a special project investigating the interplay among technology, communications and the humanities. <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> often cites <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>, especially the late prime minister's early warnings in the 1930s that <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> must rearm in response to the growing military threat from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> says he sees `` some rather deadly parallels'' today, and warned Monday that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> must remain strong `` to deal with increasing Soviet threats.''

<HEAD>Cuba To Release More Political Prisoners, U.S. Officials Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Cuban government plans to release a significant number of political prisoners in an effort to block a formal <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> investigation of human rights in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say. <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> will `` release thousands of political prisoners mixed in with common prisoners'' to persuade member nations to vote down the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> proposal for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> investigation, said <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Valladares </PERSON>, chief of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. A spokesman for a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> delegation in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> was quoted today by the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lauderdale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sentinel </ORGANIZATION> as saying a major announcement would be made in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> on Wednesday, but he would not elaborate. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official who closely follows <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> affairs said the `` thousands'' suggested by <PERSON> Valladares </PERSON>, who spent 22 years in <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> prisons, may be overly optimistic, but a good chance exists the Cubans will free enough prisoners to make the action appear significant. `` Even if it is for cosmetic purposes, we love it,'' said the official, who asked not to be identified. `` We're talking about human lives here. Even if a release is done cynically, people are still out of prison.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> placed a similar resolution before the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s annual session last year. It failed by one vote on a procedural motion 19 to 18, with five nations abstaining. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> again expects a close vote. Although the resolution does not condemn <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s human rights record, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> investigation of human rights practices on the communist island would be politically embarrassing to <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. Estimates of Cuban political prisoners range from as few as 500 to as many as 10,000. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> himself has acknowledged holding 1,000 to 2,000 such prisoners.

 Republican presidential hopeful <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said today that charges of <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s sexual misconduct had been known for a few months, but somebody planned the scandal to embarrass him before the Super Tuesday elections. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, a television evangelist accused of sexual misconduct, was ordered Monday by the hierarchy of his church in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, to limit his preaching and enter counseling. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who bristles at the label of former television evangelist, said today that evidence showing that <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> had been involved with prostitutes had `` lied dormant since last October.'' It `` stretches the imagination and stretches credulity'' that it came two weeks `` before the most important primary in the nation,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate said during a news conference in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. A round of primaries and caucuses will be held Super Tuesday, March 8, in 20 states. `` Nothing happens to people by accident,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said in an interview Monday with the <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, Independent-Mail. `` It is kind of funny this came up two weeks before the most important primaries in the nation. People probably wonder what went on. `` I think somebody had something to do with it,'' said <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. `` Somebody else planned all these things, I am afraid.'' Asked again today whether he had any evidence to show that the scandal broke just before Super Tuesday, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> replied: `` I have no knowledge. It's certainly a coincidence.'' On Monday, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> offered no proof of his contention, and declined to say to whom he was referring. However, in the same interview he accused the campaign of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of `` dirty politics'' and `` trickery'' directed at him. A <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign official, asked about the remarks, said <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had apparently adopted a new campaign strategy of `` making bizarre statements in order to make news.'' `` To suggest that we had something to do with -LRB- the Swaggart affair -RRB- borders on the outlandish,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s deputy Southern political director, in a telephone interview from his home in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> repeated his charge today that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign plans `` dirty tricks'' in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, saying he was told that the vice president's campaign plans to run some television ads `` dealing with religious bigotry in the few days before the -LRB- <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> primary -RRB- elections.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign ad director <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogich </PERSON> said today the only ad running in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> is a biographical commercial. Two weeks ago, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> scolded <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> anchor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON>, who interviewed him live on the night of the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, for referring to him as a former television evangelist. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who founded the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> and for years hosted its flagship program `` The 700 Club,'' says he wants to be described as a former religious broadcaster, or a television businessman. Earlier Monday, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had said <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s troubles were `` unfortunate,'' but had nothing to do with him. He said the <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> case will have `` no more effect on me than <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'' had on other candidates, referring to <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s problems following reports of his relationship with a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> model. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> dropped out of the presidential race in May but rejoined it in December. `` It -LRB- the Swaggart controversy -RRB- will not affect me because it has nothing whatsoever to do with me,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Anderson </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. `` But I want to tell people to ask <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> what he thinks about all this. `` I have been told of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s dirty tricks and I expect to see them in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` His campaign will use every kind of dirty trick against me because this state is important and I have a lot of support and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> knows that.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> holds its primary March 5, three days before 20 states, mainly in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, hold primaries and caucuses.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> today denied it had conducted a political investigation of anti-Reagan activists, saying it had information that members of the targeted group planned or discussed disrupting the 1984 Republican convention and shutting down a public utility. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s executive assistant director, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Revell </PERSON>, came before a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel to defend the probe of the Committee In Solidarity with the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION>. The probe was ended without any charges being filed. The group has said it was investigated because it opposes President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Central America policies. Documents previously released in the March 1985-June 1985 probe show that <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and informants sent to spy on <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> collected so much information on peaceful protest activities that bureau headquarters was worried that the investigation had gone too far. The documents, released under the Freedom of Information Act, have shown that while the investigation was targeted at <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION>, the files eventually included information on hundreds of other individuals and groups, ranging from <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> nuns to union leaders who opposed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> policies. In defending the probe, <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that in addition to possible violence, <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> was involved in circulating forged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> documents and had strong ties to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> communist party. `` Some have insinuated that this investigation was politically motivated as many individuals associated with <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> were opposed to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policies in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> said. `` Nothing could be further from the truth. `` We did find indications that some <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> members were at least discussing and planning violence. Our investigtions uncovered one <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> member who was tasked to determine response times of emergency services in a major <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> city; another <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> member stated he had developed a system to shut down a public utility in a major midwestern city; as well as plans to violently disrupt the 1984 Republican convention.'' The bureau initiated the investigation under foreign intelligence and counter-intelligence guidelines, designed to protect the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> against crimes such as espionage and terrorism, in which foreign powers or groups are involved. These guidelines allow the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to focus more on politically oriented groups and their missions than on specific crimes that are planned or carried out. Because of this wider latitude, some lawmakers and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> warn that it is easy to cross the line and investigate free speech and peaceful assembly. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> said the investigation in this case `` was predicated on information received from several sources that certain leaders and key members of <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> were involved in covertly furnishing funds and materials to a foreign terrorist organization.'' The group was identified as the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>, the group fighting a war against the U.S.-backed government of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, chief legislative counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said the investigation should have started under the most strict guidelines, those for general criminal investigations. These investigations can only begin `` when facts or circumstances reasonably indicate that a federal crime has been, is being, or will be committed.'' If the crime has already been committed, the probe focuses on who committed the act and on securing evidence. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is given greater leeway for a domestic `` intelligence'' investigation, which can focus on groups in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> trying `` to further political or social goals through activities that involve criminal violence.'' The bureau did not place the <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> investigation under either the intelligence or general guidelines, but under the foreign intelligence and counter-intelligence rules that involve participation by foreign entities. These rules remain largely classified, but officials familiar with them say they provide the widest latitude among the different sets of guidelines. On July 26, 1984 _ some 16 months after the investigation began _ <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> headquarters sent 32 field offices a message that suggested some of them were going beyond the guidelines. `` Some offices have reported information recently regarding political statements and political lobbying by <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> affiliates,'' it said. `` Supervisors in recipient offices must carefully monitor this and related investigations and asset operations within your respective divisions to ensure appropriate direction, targeting and reporting.'' But messages from the field showed that bureaus were still confused. In August 1984 the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> office told headquarters, `` the field is still not sure of how much seemingly legitimate political activity can be monitored.'' And prior to the July directive, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> headquarters received messages like this one from <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>: `` The bureau is requested to furnish <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> with guidelines regarding investigation of captioned matter, vis-a-vis religious organizations _ specifically the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>.'' Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION>, said he does not fault the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> for starting the investigation under foreign intelligence guidelines, but for `` a management problem'' in not shutting it down much sooner `` We want it narrow, and stopped when criminal conduct is not found,'' he said in an interview. `` The <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> investigation went on for years and there was no criminal conduct. Somebody should have blown the whistle.'' <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>, said the field offices became `` a vacuum cleaner for collection of First Amendment activity.'' `` They never began to narrow it,'' he said. `` They ended up sweeping up the First Amendment activity and broadly targeting <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> all over the country.''

<TEXT>
 The Afghan guerrilla alliance today announced a plan to form a coalition Cabinet that would replace the communist government of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and ensure the withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, meanwhile, reported a bomb went off in the Soviet Embassy compound, indicating the guerrillas are intensifying their attacks in the capital. The seven-party <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> announced the plan in a statement telexed from the Pakistani border city of <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>. It stipulates that <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> would have a 28-member Cabinet to replace <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The statement said the government would be made up of 14 ministers from among the guerrilla leadership, seven representatives from among the 3 million Afghan refugees in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and `` seven Moslems presently living in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>.'' Earlier, guerrilla leaders said these `` Moslems'' would include non-communists in the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> administration who have not committed serious offenses `` against the people'' during the eight-year war. The proposal, which would allow the guerrillas to control the Afghan government, was not expected to be accepted by the Soviets or the current administration in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Diplomatic sources said today that Moslem guerrillas have stepped up attacks in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, where Communist officials and Soviet advisers reportedly are preparing to leave. Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said at least 18 explosions were heard during the past week in the Afghan capital, including one in the Soviet Embassy compound and one near <LOCATION> Radio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. One source said a bomb inside the Soviet compound Feb. 19 caused some injuries, but there were no further details. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> announced early this month that the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> could begin pulling its 115,000 troops out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by May 15 if <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> sign a U.N.-sponsored accord by mid-March. A new round of indirect talks between <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> is scheduled for March 2 at <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> insists an accord should be linked to an agreed plan on formation of a transitional government. <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> and the guerrillas are pushing this point because they fear an outbreak of fighting between various Afghan groups and the communists if no government is in power. The Soviets, however, disagree, charging that such an insistance on setting up an interim government is obstructing Soviet plans to withdraw. Guerrilla leaders have rejected any power-sharing with the current <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> officials and today's statement from <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION> backed up that position. The statement said a Shoora-ali or supreme council would also be formed to oversee the Cabinet. It would consist of the leaders of the seven-party alliance and would provide `` joint leadership during the interim period.'' The insurgents said the `` broad-based transitional government will represent all sections of the Afghan nation.'' The alliance said there would be a consultative council of 75 members consisting of two members from each of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s 28 provinces and 19 members from among Moslem religious scholars, intellectuals and technocrats. The council would frame the interim laws to administer the country until an elected constituent assembly writes a constitution. The country would adopt the name, the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, `` wherein the Koran ... will be supreme,'' the statement added.

<TEXT>
 A police crackdown on street gangs has been applauded by some black leaders tired of the violence that claimed 300 lives last year, but the arrest of an off-duty black officer also raises the question of harassment. Black and Hispanic leaders accused police of largely ignoring the gang violence until a woman bystander was killed Jan. 30 in street-gang crossfire in an upscale neighborhood. But two weeks after the shooting, an off-duty black policeman from a blue-collar suburb was arrested by <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police as he stood on a street corner in the same neighborhood, accompanied by six black youths. The officer said his group was conducting an informal `` sting'' operation to investigate alleged harassment by city police. Both the arrest and the killing of 27-year-old <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Toshima </PERSON> occurred in <LOCATION> Westwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, a theater and restaurant district that soaring housing prices have turned into a relatively wealthy neighborhood. Authorities say there were more than 300 gang-related murders in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in 1987 and the rate is increasing. But gang violence usually is confined to the predominantly black and Hispanic southside neighborhoods of the nation's second-largest city where turf battles between drug dealers have led to drive-by shootings. Five people were killed and five others were injured in gang shootings last weekend even as police staged a crackdown. Deputy Chief <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Levant </PERSON>, newly appointed as the city's anti-gang czar, said the more than 50 arrests were part of a strategy to prevent murders by taking gang members out of circulation. Children playing in parks and a 67-year-old woman sitting in a wheelchair have been killed when gang hitmen missed their targets. `` And that's not the way it should be. We should be able to live normally,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which says it represents thousands of black families. City Councilman <PERSON> Nate </PERSON> <PERSON> Holden </PERSON>, who is black and represents a largely black district, said the yearning for more police protection crosses racial lines. `` I've had white people complain about the gangs. They all just want to feel secure in their community and their homes,'' he said. At the same time, the sting by Sgt. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Hawthorne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> called into question the racial sensitivity of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police. `` None of those kids did anything except stand on that corner and be black _ and that was enough,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who was released on his recognizance after being arrested on a misdemeanor charge of resisting an officer. The police department defended the arrest of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and frisking of the others, saying the group, dressed like gang members, was blocking the sidewalk and refused to move. The question of police harassment is among the issues being considered as the city moves ahead with a plan to hire 150 more officers, increasing the force to its largest strength ever, 7,500 officers. Police Chief <PERSON> Darryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> on Monday declined to say anything about how he will deploy his forces until after a March 8 hearing of the city's advisory <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, as he approved the new hiring last week, said the additional forces would help `` return this city to a drug-free, gang-free atmosphere.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON>, a criminologist and former <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> member, said more police officers is not the answer. `` It would n't solve the problem It would for a few days or for a few weeks. Then you get complaints of overpolicing and harassing,'' he said. `` Historically, there's a resentment to an excessive show of force,'' said <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Capune </PERSON>, professor of criminology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>. `` It has a racist overtone, you know, there seems to be more crime because there's more officers. It becomes a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy.'' But <PERSON> Holden </PERSON> replied: `` These guys can sit in some classroom and think what it's supposed to be like. But they have n't seen the real world. I resent them. Let them come into the black community and see what it's like.'' Hundreds of southside residents demonstrated at police headquarters after extra officers were deployed in <LOCATION> Westwood </LOCATION> this month, primarily at the request of merchants who were afraid their business would be hurt by news of the gang shooting. Minority activists later publicized a study by the independent <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> that appeared to show police responded more slowly to crimes in poor areas. The police department on Friday released a letter from the principal author of the report stating that it had been widely misinterpreted. The letter said the study concluded the department takes too long to respond to emergencies, but that geographical differences are not significant.

 A British soldier ordered jailed for life for killing a <ORGANIZATION> Belfast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> has been freed and returned to his regiment after serving only three years in prison, the army said today. The disclosure came amid Anglo-Irish tensions following the killing of a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> man on Sunday by a British soldier and the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> government's decision to conduct its own investigation of the slaying, which occurred in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The announcement that the convicted killer, Pvt. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thain </PERSON>, was back in uniform, although not in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, provoked sharp reactions from leaders of the province's <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> minority. At the same time, leaders of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> majority were angered by <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>'s announcement that it will probe Sunday's killing <PERSON> Thain </PERSON> was jailed for the fatal shooting of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, road manager of the pop group <LOCATION> Bananarama </LOCATION>, on Aug. 9, 1983. <PERSON> Thain </PERSON> claimed in court that he fired because riots were going on and he believed <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> was about to pull a gun on him. But the judge found him `` deliberately untruthful'' and said he did not believe <PERSON> Thain </PERSON> truly feared <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> was about to shoot at him. <PERSON> Thain </PERSON> was the first soldier sentenced to life imprisonment for actions in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. An army statement said <PERSON> Thain </PERSON> was then 18 and `` while the army in no way condones his action, we consider the incident to have been a tragic error of judgment made by a young man in very difficult circumstances.'' The Home Office said <PERSON> Thain </PERSON> was released on a life license, a form of parole whereby he can be reimprisoned `` should his behavior give rise to concern.'' It said he was freed after a review by the state parole board. <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the legal political wing of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Thain </PERSON>'s release showed there was no justice in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The victim's father, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, said: `` I'm very, very shocked and distressed I ca n't believe this has happened.'' Meanwhile, the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> government sent Deputy Police Commissioner <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowley </PERSON> to <PERSON> Monaghan </PERSON>, on the border with <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, to launch an investigation into Sunday's shooting of 23-year-old <PERSON> Aidan </PERSON> <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON>. <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON> was killed by a bullet from an army observation tower at a checkpoint near <LOCATION> Aughnacloy </LOCATION>, half a mile from the frontier in <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tyrone </LOCATION>. Relatives said he was walking to a weekly Gaelic football game and had passed through the checkpoint when he was shot. <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON> was a <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> supporter, and his former parish priest said he was harassed whenever he passed through the checkpoint. Press Association, the British news agency, said the soldier who fired at <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON> told his interrogators it was an accident. The soldier is in military custody. The Irish move was seen as a calculated slight to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, since its police force in the province was conducting an inquiry. British authorities stressed that the Irish investigation would be confined to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s side of the border.

<TEXT>
 A judge has ordered a quick trial of a lawsuit that could affect whether an 11-year-old boy with leukemia lives or dies. The suit was filed by the boy's father, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacina </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, to regain health insurance coverage he contends was mistakenly canceled. Doctors say the boy, <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON>, needs a bone marrow transplant by March 15 to survive more than a few months. But the <ORGANIZATION> Fred </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutchinson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> hospital that could treat the boy, requires patients to have insurance coverage or $ 100,000 in hand before it will perform the procedure, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Edmonds </PERSON>. Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Judge <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. Character declined Monday to decide the case without a jury, but set a jury trial date for Monday so a verdict could be issued in time for <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> to get the treatment. `` We've definitely advanced this case more than a year,'' Character said. `` They -LRB- the Lacinas -RRB- came in and indicated the condition of the young man had become more critical. ... Hopefully it can be resolved in a timely fashion.'' <PERSON> Lacina </PERSON> says chemotherapy no longer is an effective treatment for his son. In the lawsuit, filed in 1986, <PERSON> Lacina </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Nationwide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> terminated his health insurance without notifying him. A nine-year agent for Nationwide, <PERSON> Lacina </PERSON> lost his job in 1983 because of company cutbacks. Attorneys for both sides agree that he paid to continue his policy after he lost his job. <PERSON> Lacina </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeppe </PERSON>, told Character that <PERSON> Lacina </PERSON> did n't receive a copy of his policy, a notice that his premium was due, or a termination notice in late 1983. He asked the judge to rule in <PERSON> Lacina </PERSON>'s favor without a jury trial. <PERSON> Jeppe </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lacina </PERSON> is applying for Medicaid while he awaits a decision on the case. Meanwhile, a fund for the boy has been established at a bank, he said. Nationwide's attorney, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, told Character that the company mailed <PERSON> Lacina </PERSON> the documents in question. A jury should decide whether <PERSON> Lacina </PERSON> received them, he said. `` The facts of this case are indeed tragic. A little boy through no fault of his own may be denied care,'' <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said. `` The long and the short of it is whether Mr. <PERSON> Lacina </PERSON> is telling the truth when he says he did n't receive either of those letters or that policy.'' <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said Nationwide will prove at the trial that <PERSON> Lacina </PERSON>'s behavior was inconsistent for a man who thought he had health insurance coverage <PERSON> Lacina </PERSON> ran up large hospital bills for his son and filed for bankruptcy, <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said. `` The lawsuit was n't filed until the summer of 1986,'' <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said. `` What was Mr. <PERSON> Lacina </PERSON> doing between 1983 and 1986 with these hospital bills if he had coverage?'' <PERSON> Jeppe </PERSON> declined to discuss the case aside from the comments he made in court.

 <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> has written to city councilors seeking approval of an experimental sterile needle exchange for drug addicts in hopes of curbing the spread of AIDS. <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said addicts, their sex partners and their babies `` are the fastest growing group of AIDS victims,'' and that conventional anti-drug measures `` do not go far enough in the short term'' to curb the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON>, the city's director of clinical and community health services, was prepared to outline the proposed program at a closed meeting this morning at City Hall, according to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>. He recently toured several <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> cities to examine needle distribution programs. Addicts could enter the program on their own or by referral, <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> is seeking approval by the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> of a home rule petition to the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, the newspaper said. The move would bypass any applicable state laws against possession of hypodermic syringes by drug addicts or against dispensing such equipment to drug addicts. Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has opposed any needle exchange program, as had state Public Health Commissioner <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Prothrow-Stith </PERSON>. The Globe quoted <PERSON> Prothrow-Stith </PERSON> as suggesting Monday night that if the state wanted to consider `` something really radical,'' it could supply addicts not only with sterile needles but also with heroin. But <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stobierski </PERSON> said today the comment `` was in no way a policy recommendation or proposal,'' but was made by the commissioner in explaining why she believed the needle exchange proposal was `` very, very wrong.'' In a statement today, <PERSON> Prothrow-Stith </PERSON> said the department remains opposed to a needle exchange for IV drug users'' and that the state should continue to concentrate on drug treatment and rehabilitation programs. A proposal by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to supply a small number of addicts with clean needles on an experimental basis awaits formal approval from the state health commissioner, Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON>, who had opposed the idea but said last month that he would approve it. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> wants to supply 200 to 400 addicts with syringes. The recipients would have to turn in used needles to get fresh ones. The needles would be tested for AIDS and to ensure that they were n't shared. Although the test period would last a year, the city's health commissioner, Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, has said he expected solid indications of success or failure within six months. AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be able to provide military help to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies despite the new U.S.-Soviet treaty banning medium-range nuclear weapons from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiator for the pact told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee today. `` If it is not prohibited by the treaty, we can do it,'' <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON> was testifying about the effect of article 14, a provision which says that neither side shall do anything, now or in the future, to undercut the pact. Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, R-Ind., told <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON> that `` I'm concerned about article 14'' because it might limit future <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations The provision is a standard clause added to other treaties which simply restates the intention of both nations to abide by the pact, <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON> said. The treaty spells out in great detail what each side can not do and anything is permitted if it is not prohibited, said <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON>. For example, said <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON>, the treaty does n't ban the transfer of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technology to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations such as <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to develop ground-launched cruise missiles. Those <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missiles will be banned by the treaty but the British could go ahead and build their own, he said. <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators resisted Soviet efforts to block <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> help for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. `` We knew their goal was to find a way to put a brake on <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> activities,'' he said. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> pledged today that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will do its part to ensure that the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance remains strong, saying in an address broadcast to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that `` our destiny is coupled with yours.'' In the address, which came a week before a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit meeting, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> reaffirmed the alliance agreement that an attack on any member nation is an attack against all of them. `` Simply put, an attack on <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> is the same as an attack on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON>'s testimony was part of a detailed examination of the pact, a line-by-line scrutiny which legislators said was necessary to avoid possible conflicts with future administrations over the treaty's meaning. `` It is very regrettable that we have to go through this,'' <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., said Monday to <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and other Democrats noted that the scrutiny arises from congressional distrust of the executive branch, a skepticism born of the fight over the meaning of an earlier treaty. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> noted the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had delivered 31 volumes of records about how U.S.-Soviet negotiators reached the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces pact signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Committee staffers spent 300 hours reviewing only three volumes of records that preceded the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said. The Armed Services panel is one of three <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committees examining the INF treaty. Ratification by the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is expected but the votes will be delayed until after <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>'s committee finishes it close examination, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> told his colleagues Monday. Ratification would require a two-thirds vote. The distrust arose from a dispute between the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration over the meaning of the ABM pact, particularly how it would affect <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Star Wars missile-defense research program. The existing `` narrow'' interpretation of the ABM pact would ban some tests of the Strategic Defense Initiative, as Star Wars is formally known. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has asserted that his administration has the right to unilaterally move to a `` broad'' view of the pact that would permit SDI tests. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> led a congressional fight to block the move to a `` broad'' view of the ABM pact and promised to delay the INF ratification until the administration promised that current testimony on the INF pact was `` authoritative.'' Administration officials had argued that the 1973 executive branch testimony on the ABM pact was n't `` authoritative.'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> told <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON> that committee staff members had drawn up 135 questions, many of them technical, about possible ambiguities in the treaty. Two other Democrats on the committee supported <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>'s decision to scrutinize the INF pact. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said, `` I'm sorry there was a reinterpretation of the ABM treaty that made this necessary.'' Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, D-Neb., said, `` It's sad we have to go through the exercise we're going through here. Meantime, Dr. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Teller </PERSON>, the physicist who is considered the father of both SDI and the hydrogen bomb, supported the treaty in testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Teller noted that he deeply distrusts the Soviets and said, `` my personal approach -LRB- to the treaty -RRB- is careful, doubtful, yet positive.'' Teller termed the fights over the meaning of the treaty `` senseless debates.''

 <LOCATION> NEW </LOCATION> <LOCATION> YORK </LOCATION> _ A 70-year-old man reputed to be the underboss of the Gambino crime family has been sentenced to 15 years in prison and fined $ 820,000 for a racketeering conviction. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> said Monday he sentenced <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Armone </PERSON> to prison despite his age because he was convinced the defendant was a high-ranking member of the crime family. <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> also cited <PERSON> Armone </PERSON>'s lengthy criminal record, which he said began when the defendant was 15 years old. Armone, of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, was convicted Dec. 22 of racketeering conspiracy involving extortion, bribery and illegal interstate travel to commit bribery. He was jailed after his conviction when he refused to renounce any organized crime ties, a condition for his release from detention. He had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years for the most serious charge, racketeering. One of the bribery charges accused Armone and a co-defendant, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON>, of plotting to give a $ 20,000 bribe so that <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON>'s son would be transferred from a state prison to a federal prison, where presumably he would receive better treatment. The plot was unsuccessful. <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON>, 76, the reputed former consigliere of the <PERSON> Gambino </PERSON> family, was sentenced earlier this month to 10 years in prison and fined $ 300,000 for his racketeering conviction. <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> stayed the sentence pending appeal. Two other co-defendants were also sentenced Monday. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Vitta </PERSON>, 49, of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, a reputed Gambino soldier, was given a 10-year prison sentence and fined $ 250,000. <PERSON> Vitta </PERSON> was convicted of racketeering conspiracy, loansharking and other charges. <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Migliorisi </PERSON>, 49, of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, was sentenced to three years in jail and fined $ 25,000 for his extortion and obstruction of justice conviction. The four defendants were among 16 people with alleged ties to the <PERSON> Gambino </PERSON> family who were indicted in June 1986. Of the 16 defendants, 11 have now been convicted or have pleaded guilty, two were acquitted, charges against one defendant were dismissed, another defendant is missing and believed dead, and one is awaiting trial. Armone faces additional federal charges of extortion and racketeering in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, where he and 12 other people with alleged ties to the <PERSON> Gambino </PERSON> family were named last month in a 22-count indictment.

<HEAD>Court Rules on Criminal Suspect's Rights in California Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A criminal suspect's rights are not violated when a witness who is unable to identify the suspect in court testifies about an earlier identification of the accused, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today. The justices, voting 6-2, ordered the reinstatement of the conviction of a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> prison inmate in the beating of a prison guard who suffered memory loss because of the attack. Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>, in his opinion for the court, said a defendant's right to cross-examine his accusers is not violated by admission of a prior, out-of-court identification statement from a witness who is unable to explain in court the basis for the identification. <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> said defense lawyers have ample power to attack the credibility of such witnesses when they take the stand. `` The weapons available to impugn the witness's statement when memory loss is asserted will of course not always achieve success,'' <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> said. `` But successful cross-examination is not the constitutional guarantee.'' The decision is a victory for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, which urged the court to reinstate the federal conviction of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> for assault with intent to murder <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, a guard at a federal prison in <LOCATION> Lompoc </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, a prisoner there at the time of the attack, was sentenced to an additional 20 years for the assault The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> overturned <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>' assault conviction on grounds he was denied the right to cross-examine Foster effectively. Foster was attacked on April 12, 1982, with a metal pipe. He suffered numerous injuries to his head, face, arms and hands. On May 5, 1982, shortly before he was released from a hospital, <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> told an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent that <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> had attacked him. Foster also picked <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>' photograph from several mug shots. But at the trial, <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said he was unable to recall who assaulted him or whether he actually saw his assailant. He did testify that he remembered identifying <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> when questioned in the hospital by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent but said he no longer remembered why he said <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> was the assailant. The 9th Circuit court said Foster may have been influenced by visitors who spoke with him during his hospital stay. Three inmates testified that <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> was the attacker. There also was evidence that <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> attended a meeting the day before the assault of the <ORGANIZATION> Moorish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, a prison religious group that discussed attacking Foster. In a dissenting opinion today, Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said the high court ruling `` reduces the right of confrontation to a purely procedural protection, and a markedly hollow one at that.'' He was joined by Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who became a member of the court Thursday, did not take part in the decision. The case is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, 86-877.

<HEAD>Man `Cures' Mental Illness By Shooting Self in Brain</HEAD>

Weekly and the British Journal of Psychiatry are two different

<TEXT>
 A young mentally ill man egged into a suicide attempt by his mother apparently cured his phobia of germs and obsession for handwashing by shooting himself in the head, doctors said. The .22 - caliber slug destroyed the section of the brain responsible for his disabling obsessive-compulsive behavior without causing any other brain damage to the man, a straight-A student, his doctor The afflicted man tried to kill himself five years ago, when he was 19, said psychiatrist <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Solyom </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Shaughnessy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Victims of the disorder typically have an inexplicable compulsion to repeat activities over and over. The man, identified only as <PERSON> George </PERSON> in a report in Physician's Weekly and the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatry </ORGANIZATION>, washed his hands hundreds of times a day and took frequent showers, <PERSON> Solyom </PERSON> said The behavior forced him to drop out of school and quit his job. <PERSON> Solyom </PERSON> treated <PERSON> George </PERSON> for more than a year before he attempted suicide. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> was also very depressed and told his mother that his life was so wretched that he would rather die,'' <PERSON> Solyom </PERSON> said. `` Parents of obsessive-compulsives, particularly mothers, often have cruel streaks,'' he said. `` She said, ` So look <PERSON> George </PERSON>, if your life is so wretched, just go and shoot yourself.' So <PERSON> George </PERSON> went to the basement, stuck a .22 - caliber rifle in his mouth and pulled the trigger The bullet lodged in the left front lobe of the brain. Surgeons removed it, but could not get out all the fragments. `` When he was transferred to our hospital three weeks later, he had hardly any compulsions left,'' <PERSON> Solyom </PERSON> said. After brain surgery to remove the bullet he showed no signs of his former obsession, the doctor said. He returned to school, got a new job and is now in his second year of college, having retained the same IQ as he had before the illness struck, <PERSON> Solyom </PERSON> said. Monday's edition of Physician's Weekly wryly described the failed suicide attempt as `` successful radical surgery.'' The story was also reported in today's editions of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times. `` The idea that a man could blow out part of his frontal lobe and have his pathological symptoms cured is quite remarkable, but it is not beyond belief,'' said psychiatrist <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballantine </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` What made the case so very interesting was that we had measured IQ and done a lot of other tests before the suicide attempt,'' <PERSON> Solyom </PERSON> said. `` Afterward, we compared results and he had not lost anything. We used very sensitive tests to measure brain damage and could find none.'' New research indicates that as much as 3 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population displays some obsessive-compulsive behavior, according to psychiatrist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenike </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Conventional psychotherapy is useless in such victims, <PERSON> Jenike </PERSON> said. The disorder is most effectively treated with a combination of antidepressant drugs and behavioral therapy. As a last resort, neurosurgeons will occasionally remove part of the left front lobe of the brain, where the obsessive behavior is thought to originate. The operation is probably performed between 10 and 30 times per year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ballantine </ORGANIZATION> said, with mixed results.

<TEXT>
 Time is running out for long-term illegal aliens to apply for amnesty under a yearlong program, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> warned. The deadline for applications under the legalization program is May 4, and <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said Monday there probably wo n't be an extension. `` We have 73 days, and that's plenty of time for anybody who is eligible to get their application in,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said at a news conference at a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> neighborhood INS office. He refused to discuss topics other than immigration. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 allows aliens who have lived continuously in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since 1981 or before to apply for residency with the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` My hope in being here today is to dramatize both the importance of the process, the desire of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to confer legalization on everybody who is eligible, and to urge everyone in the category to apply as soon as possible,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, who oversees the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> as the nation's top domestic law enforcement official, refused to comment on Israeli Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' recent assertion that he wrote the attorney general in 1985 about a controversial <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> oil pipeline project. `` I'm here to talk about immigration today, and that's the only topic that's appropriate,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said. Immigration officials have made `` tremendous strides'' in handling amnesty applications from nearly 1.3 million people nationwide, said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, who called the program one of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s key activities. The attorney general handed temporary residency cards to eight aliens who now must wait 18 months before completing the legalization process.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today limited the job protection for government workers fired for lacking security clearances. By a 5-3 vote, the justices agreed with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration that the <ORGANIZATION> Merit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> lacks authority to decide whether the denial of security clearance is justified. Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, writing for the court, said, `` It should be obvious that no one has a right to a security clearance.'' He said judgments about who should receive clearance `` must be made by those with the necessary expertise in protecting classified information'' and he said the board lacks that expertise. The court ruled against <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Egan </PERSON>, who was hired in 1981 as a laborer at the Trident Naval Refit Facility in <LOCATION> Bremerton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, on the condition he subsequently receive a security clearance. The facility is used to test and repair Trident submarines. All jobs at the facility require security clerance. When he was denied the clearance because of two past criminal convictions, <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> was fired in 1983. <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> challenged the firing in an appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> Merit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which was created by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 to protect federal civilian employees from unfair disciplinary treatement. The board concluded that it lacked the authority to review <PERSON> Egan </PERSON>'s case. But a federal appeals court here overturned the board's decision and sent <PERSON> Egan </PERSON>'s case back to the board for further study. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration argued that the appeals court ruling threatened the government's ability to protect national security. Dissenting today were Justices <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>. White, writing for the three, said the government's interest in protecting its secrets would not be jeopardized by granting <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> a hearing before the review board. `` The majority's decision frustrated ... congressional intent by denying any meaningful hearing to employees such as -LRB- <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> -RRB- who are discharged on national security grounds,'' he said. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who joined the high court Thursday, did not take part in today's decision. In other action, the court: _ Ruled that a criminal suspect's rights are not violated when a witness who is unable to identify the suspect in court testifies about an earlier identification of the accused. The justices, voting 6-2, ordered the reinstatement of the conviction of a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> prison inmate in the beating of a prison guard who suffered memory loss because of the attack. _ Ruled unanimously that businesses may not be sued in federal court for refusing to contribute to multi-employer union pension funds after a collective bargaining agreement expires. In an 8-0 ruling, the court rejected <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration arguments that barring lawsuits in such cases could undermine the solvency of the multi-employer pension plans. The security case is <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Egan </PERSON>, 86-1552.

<HEAD>Marine Corps Charges Two Women with `Indecent Acts'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> has charged two women officers with `` fraternization and indecent acts'' with other female troops at the training base here, a spokesman said. Maj. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> McLean </PERSON>, public affairs officer at the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Parris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, said a sergeant and a captain in the Fourth Recruit Training Battalion were charged Friday with violations of several articles under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. He said charges against other women are being considered. `` An Article 32 hearing, which is similar to a grand jury hearing, has been scheduled for next week,'' <PERSON> McLean </PERSON> said. `` The purpose of this hearing is to inquire into the allegations and charges and recommend disposition.'' The spokesman said the hearing could result in a recommendation for court-martial, administrative action or a recommendation that the charges be dropped. Charged were Capt. <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gretch </PERSON>, administrative officer for the battalion, who has been in the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> since 1981, and Sgt. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kile </PERSON>, a former drill instructor who has been in the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> since 1983, <PERSON> McLean </PERSON> said. Earlier this month, the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s ban on homosexual soldiers unconstitutional. But <PERSON> McLean </PERSON> said the charges are not affected by the ruling. `` They are not being charged with lesbianism, but with indecent acts,'' he said. Capt. <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Schilling </PERSON>, a public information officer for <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said Monday the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>' policy on homosexuality is the same as that of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>. The uniform code states that homosexuality is `` incompatible with military service,'' and that certain overt acts are prohibited. The Marines do not knowingly enlist people who are homosexual, and the type of action they take against <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> who are found to be homosexual is left up to the commanding officer, said Lt. Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shotwell </PERSON>. It can range from an administrative discharge, under honorable conditions, to court-martial, which can include a military prison sentence. Three women who said they were being investigated told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> newspaper of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> had planned to court-martial or discharge as many as 10 women who train female recruits. None of the women interviewed by The State were charged Friday. The women, who spoke to the newspaper on the condition they not be identified, said they and others have been accused of homosexuality, sodomy and fraternization but have not yet been formally charged. They said they are not homosexual. <LOCATION> Parris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> is one of two boot camps in the country where recruits are sent for an 11-week basic training program, and the only one to which women are sent. Of the 200,000 Marines, roughly 10,000 are women, officials said.

 A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> law aimed at forcing some large private clubs to admit women and racial minorities as members violates `` the fundamental right of our citizens ... to choose who their friends will be,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was told today. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON>, a lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clubs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the city's method _ not its objective _ was based on `` a fundamentally incorrect analysis of the freedom to associate.'' The court's decision, expected by July, could carry an impact well beyond <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s borders. At least five other major cities have similar ordinances. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimroth </PERSON>, chief lawyer for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, argued that <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON>'s clients have fabricated a constitutional case. `` It's their burden to show there are real clubs out there that would get hurt, and they have n't,'' <PERSON> Zimroth </PERSON> said. Both <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zimroth </PERSON> had their arguments repeatedly interrupted with questions from the justices, including Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who joined the court last Thursday and only recently resigned from a men-only club. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> appeared particularly interested in the fact that the city law exempts some clubs, such as the American Legion and the Protective Order of Elks. Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, who also recently resigned from a male-only club, did not ask a question during the 60-minute session. At one point, Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> suggested that the city law may be a valid attempt to battle bias, pointedly telling <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON>, `` You want to torpedo it.'' The city law exempts `` distinctly private organizations'' from its anti-bias requirements. But it deprives non-religious groups of that designation if they have more than 400 members, provide regular meal service and regularly receive payment of member dues from non-members such as employers. Similar ordinances were enacted recently in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s highest court upheld the law, rejecting arguments that it unconstitutionally creates an irrefutable presumption that such organizations are not truly private. In previous rulings, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has ruled that states, through their public accommodations laws, may force the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jaycees </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Rotary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> to admit women as members. In ruling unanimously in the Rotary case last May, the justices suggested that numerous other male-only or female-only private organizations may have to comply with laws requiring equal access to public accommodations. After assessing May's ruling, <ORGANIZATION> Kiwanis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> voted to end its men-only tradition and allow its 8,200 clubs worldwide to admit women. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> is composed of about 125 private clubs and associations. Many of its groups are male-only or are organized along national origin or other ethnic lines. Its challenge of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> law has been supported in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> by, among others, the Benevolent and <ORGANIZATION> Protective </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elks </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Loyal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moose </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Improved </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Men </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Managers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. The city law was defended by, among others, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governments </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Counties </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, the court's newest justice, was criticized during his recent <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation hearings for his past membership in exclusive private clubs. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> quit <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s all-male, all-white Olympic Club, after he was mentioned as a possible <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> nominee.

 A 26-year-old pipe fitter was arrested in connection with a series of 19 sexual attacks in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> area blamed on a `` bolder-than-most'' rapist, police said. <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Quarles </PERSON> was arrested Monday at a motel staked out by police, said Officer <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Monahan </PERSON> of the suburban <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Quarles </PERSON> was questioned by investigators at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> police headquarters for several hours and booked into the county jail, said <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> police spokeswoman <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Zweig </PERSON>. The series of rapes and burglaries began 14 months ago. The attacker was dubbed `` bolder-than-most'' because of the audacity of his demands and because he frequently attacked women when they were with a boyfriend or husband. <PERSON> Quarles </PERSON> was charged in the investigation of two rapes and six robberies and burglaries, <PERSON> Zweig </PERSON> said. The investigation is continuing and more charges may be filed, she said. <PERSON> Quarles </PERSON> was arrested about 5 a.m. Monday after a police detective spotted him peeking in windows and checking doors of the motel, police said, adding that a 13-inch kitchen knife was found hidden under his shirt. The arrest came an hour after a man forced his way into a room at a motel in east <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> where two elderly women were sleeping and robbed the women but did not assault them. At least 16 of the sexual assaults occurred in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, half of them at small motels.

<HEAD>Site Selection For Atom Smasher Delayed Until Late This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Selection of the site to house the planned $ 4.4 billion `` super collider'' atom smasher has been delayed from July until late in the year, Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today. `` I would guess a preferred site would be selected in November or December,'' <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He was answering a question on whether the site would be chosen before or after the committee acts on the department's request for $ 363 million in construction funds for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. `` I do n't see us making the decision'' before the committee must act, <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said. But he said there was little risk in appropriating the money before site selection since `` there is nothing new in the technology.'' Outside the hearing room, spokesman <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Keif </PERSON> said `` they need more time,'' but the department still hoped to hold to its original schedule of confirming the selection in January 1989. The eagerly sought scientific installation would probe the secrets of matter by whirling beams of protons into each other at an energy 20 times what is available with current machines. The most powerful current machine is the accelerator at <LOCATION> Batavia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> not far from the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> district of subcommittee chairman Rep. <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>, D-Ill. <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> to comment on a newspaper report of a study from a local group claiming that locating the new machine next to the <LOCATION> Batavia </LOCATION> installation would save the government $ 3.3 billion over the years through savings on components, buildings, computer programs and other facilities But <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said he was unfamiliar with the study. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> remain in the competition to house the collider.

 Federal agents have given city police officials the names of 18 <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> officers, including that of a former assistant police chief, in the latest move in an ongoing investigation of corruption in the department. Since 1985, about 75 <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> officers have been arrested, suspended or fired for a variety of misdeeds, from homicide to cocaine possession to prostitution and drunken driving. Police Chief <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON> has predicted that as many as 100 officers, nearly 10 percent of the force, could be involved in some level of corruption. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bared </PERSON>, whose name was on the list <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents gave to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> police internal security detectives Monday, is the highest-ranking person whose conduct is under scrutiny. `` In 26 years in the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, I never did anything illegal,'' he said Monday night. `` I can tell you that _ 100 percent. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Bared </PERSON> did not do anything wrong, be it civilly, criminally, ethically or whatever.'' None of the 18 has been relieved of duty, police said Monday. Bared, 49, resigned in 1986. Although police and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> have refused to discuss specific allegations, The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported that unidentified sources said they all involve drugs.

 Former TV evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> is borrowing heavily going into the critical Super Tuesday primaries, taking out a massive $ 5.5 million loan for his presidential campaign, financial reports show. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> ended January with $ 5.5 million in the bank, but his campaign had $ 6 million in debts as he far outspent any other candidate on the Super Tuesday contests involving 20 states on March 8. Rival GOP contenders <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, on the other hand, remained in good shape. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the overall fund-raising leader, ended January with $ 9.2 million in cash on hand and $ 811,029 in obligations, while <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had $ 4.2 million and $ 654,269 in bills to pay, their latest financial statements show. Neither had any loans outstanding, but the other <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> contender, Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, took out $ 750,000 in loans to get through the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> contests this month. Among Democratic candidates, money leader <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had the most cash available, $ 4 million. Besides his loan, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> reported contributions of $ 1.3 million during January. His report also listed as receipts the $ 6.5 million in federal matching funds that he applied for but had said he might not use. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had said he was philosophically opposed to the public financing system and his staff said he would only use matching funds if he needed to stay competitive. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s campaign did not return calls Monday night to answer questions about the loan, by far the biggest borrowing of any campaign for the 1988 election. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> paid off a short-term loan of $ 1.5 million that his attorney has said was secured with his matching funds, hisreport showed. The latest financial reports were due at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday, but <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s was not filed until late Monday. It showed that the new loan was taken out in January from <LOCATION> Sovran </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, at an interest rate of prime plus 1 percent and was due to be repaid on Feb. 28. The sizable expenditures on this month's <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> contests and subsequent spending toward Super Tuesday are not reflected in the new reports, which cover the period through Jan. 31. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> has spent more than any other candidate against the overall spending ceiling which is set by election law at $ 27 million for the primary season. He reported spending $ 17.6 million against the cap. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, conversely, while raising more money than any other candidate, has been watching his budget and has spent the least of any <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> contender against the cap. He reported spending $ 10.7 million against the ceiling, compared with <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s $ 12.8 million and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s $ 13.5 million. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> also spent the most of any campaign in a single state _ $ 1 million in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, compared with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s $ 335,743 and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s $ 81,645 Wealthy campaigns must keep from spending too much early in the campaign, because they could leave themselves unable to spend money on later contests without going over the limit. On the Democratic side, none of the candidates approached the cap, with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spending the most at $ 7.8 million. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor also had the biggest Democratic bank account at the beginning of this month, $ 4 million with $ 511,789 in bills to pay, while the next nearest Democrat, Sen. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, had $ 2 million with $ 84,248 in obligations. Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., borrowed $ 523,674 in January and ended the month with a $ 691,069 debt and only $ 401,176 in the bank He raised $ 534,259 in contributions for the month, $ 1.9 million in matching funds, and $ 523,674 in loans. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., entered February with $ 820,260 in debts and $ 172,477 in cash on hand He collected $ 212,702 in contributions and $ 1.9 million in matching funds during January. Aides for both <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> have said that fund-raising picked up this month and that they have whittled down their debts. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had ignored <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> to concentrate on the Super Tuesday states, but he raised very little money during the time the other candidates were campaigning hard in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. He collected only $ 180,746 in contributions during January, in addition to the $ 1.8 million in matching funds he got, his report showed. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> raised $ 804,839 in contributions and got $ 3.5 million matching funds. Democratic contender <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> reported raising $ 610,036 in donations, plus $ 598,021 in matching funds during January, ending the month with $ 509,978 in cash on hand and $ 354,881 in obligations. Former <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> ended the month with $ 615,547 in cash on hand and $ 24,484 in debts after collecting $ 70,303 in contributions and $ 937,325 in matching funds. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> continued a hand-to-mouth campaign, ending January with a debt of $ 1.3 million after raising $ 1 million for the month. However, his political director, <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, said the debt would be wiped out when <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s federal mathching funds come in this month. He insisted the campaign is not in financial trouble, saying a heavy mail solicitation program and fund-raising events are reaping about $ 400,000 a week. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> raised $ 1.2 million in contributions for January and got $ 5.6 in matching funds, while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> collected $ 767,892 privately and got $ 6.4 million in matching funds. Most candidates got very large matching fund payments in January because that was the first months the money was released, and the sums were based on the candidates' fund raising for all preceding months. Candidates can get matching funds from the federal Treasury for each contribution of $ 250 or less that they raise in private funds. The matching fund is supported by the $ 1 checkoff on individual income tax returns.

<HEAD>Court Rules Mississippi Owns Thousands of Acres of Land Near Coast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, rejecting claims by private landowners, ruled today that the state of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> owns thousands of acres of oil - and gas-rich land near the state's <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> By a 5-3 vote, the justices said states may claim title to land beneath waters subject to the tie's influence _ and not only land under navigable waters. The ebb and flow of the tide, not navigability, determines the state's ownership, said Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> for the court. `` States have interests in lands beneath tidal waters which have nothing to do with navigation,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. Those interests range from protecting fishing to setting aside submerged land for reclamation for urban expansion, he said. `` It would be odd to acknowledge such diverse uses of public trust tidelands and then suggest that the sole measure of the expanse of such lands is the navigability of the waters over them,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. The court rejected an appeal by private landowners and companies that included <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> and a partnership called <PERSON> Cinque </PERSON> <PERSON> Bambini </PERSON>. They challenged the state's claim to some 2,400 acres of undeveloped property in <LOCATION> Hancock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, Miss. The <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in 1986 that the state has control over the land based on a grant from the federal government when <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> became a state in 1817. The private landowners and companies based their claims on Spanish land grants of 1813. The state leased 600 acres of the land to <ORGANIZATION> Saga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in 1977 for oil and gas exploration. The <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> court said the state's title extends to all land subject to tidal influence, inland to the mean high water mark. The lands in question underly non-navigable bayous and streams several miles north of the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. They are influenced by the tide since they are affected by the ebb and flow of an adjacent navigable river that flows into the gulf. Dissenting today were Justices <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, writing for the three, said today's ruling will break `` a chain of title that reaches back more than 150 years'' and `` will disrupt the settled expectations of landowners not only in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> but every coastal state.'' Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who joined the court on Thursday, did not take part in the decision. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> vs. <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, 86-870.

 People magazine paid <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> <PERSON> Exner </PERSON> $ 50,000 for interviews in which she claimed to have served as a courier and contact for President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> mobster, the author of the article says. <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said Monday that she and <PERSON> Exner </PERSON>, who claims to have arranged at least 10 meetings between <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and Mafia boss <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Giancana </PERSON> in the early 1960s, split a fee of `` about $ 100,000.'' Parts of <PERSON> Exner </PERSON>'s story were questioned today by <PERSON> Giancana </PERSON>'s daughter <PERSON> Antoinette </PERSON>, the author of `` Mafia Princess. Ms. <PERSON> Giancana </PERSON> said on `` CBS This Morning'' that she never met <PERSON> Exner </PERSON> but knew that she was her father's girlfriend. And she said that her father wanted to help in the alleged assassination plot against <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. But she said that as far as she knew, her father never spoke to <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> during his time in the White House. `` He always told us about people he'd been with and met,'' she told the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> in an interview. `` But not once did he say anything about meeeting <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. I'm sure Dad would have said something.'' Moreover, `` my father had an utter contempt for the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedys </ORGANIZATION>. Why would he ever want to meet with <LOCATION> JFK </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION> or anywhere else?'' she said on the CBS program. Ms. <PERSON> Giancana </PERSON> said her father did not need <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s help, but that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> needed <PERSON> Giancana </PERSON>'s help in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> while he was running for president. She told <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> it was possible that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Exner </PERSON> to go to <PERSON> Giancana </PERSON> and ask for help, `` but how, probably, I really do n't know. Questioning <PERSON> Exner </PERSON>'s account that <PERSON> Giancana </PERSON> gave her a note to deliver to <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Giancana </PERSON> said her father did not put things in writing. `` The man had at least a little class. He never put anything in writing where they could bring it up or show it from the day he had written it.'' <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said she first arranged to talk to <PERSON> Exner </PERSON> about <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Giancana </PERSON> in 1983, but plans fell through after <PERSON> Exner </PERSON> demanded at the last minute to be paid. `` I told her, ` I do n't pay for interviews. Do n't you just want to be honest and tell the truth?''' <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> recalled. `` But I did n't get the story because I would n't pay This time, People did it.'' <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said payment was justified now because <PERSON> Exner </PERSON> has terminal cancer and `` the story is a little piece of history.'' <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, publicity manager at People, said the magazine had no comment on the fee. Columnist <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> reported in her column in today's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> that she put <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Exner </PERSON> together. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said she did not pursue <PERSON> Exner </PERSON>'s story herself because `` for <PERSON> Exner </PERSON>'s sake, I could n't afford to. `` She is suffering from terminal cancer, she needs the money to live out her days and pay medical bills, and only a magazine like People can pay the big bucks needed to offer up such a story.'' In a 1975 appearance before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> intelligence committee, <PERSON> Exner </PERSON> said she had an 18-month affair with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> before and after he entered the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and that she later had an affair with <PERSON> Giancana </PERSON>. But she said she knew of no ties between the two, and that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> never knew of her friendship with <PERSON> Giancana </PERSON>, which predated her affair with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. In an interview Monday on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America,'' <PERSON> Exner </PERSON> said she changed her story because `` things have changed dramatically for me. I've had two bouts with cancer and I've just had my lung removed and I've been given a fairly short length of time -LRB- to live. -RRB- And I was being very uncomfortable with not being able to tell the truth.'' In 1975, `` I was afraid for my life so I was afraid to tell the truth,'' she said. `` My husband and I made a very coscious decision not to tell the story.'' <PERSON> Exner </PERSON> said she witnessed one of the Giancana-Kennedy meetings, and that she carried envelopes on many occasions between <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Giancana </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Roselli </PERSON>, <PERSON> Giancana </PERSON>'s lieutenant in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. She said <PERSON> Giancana </PERSON> once told her he had met <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> in the White House. <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> apparently wanted mob assistance to win the presidency in 1960, and later to eliminate <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. <PERSON> Giancana </PERSON> was murdered in 1975, <PERSON> Roselli </PERSON> a year later. <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Exner </PERSON> produced airplane tickets, hotel bills and appointment books from 1960 through 1962 to support her story. White House telephone logs show she had more than 70 conversations with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, spokesman for Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., said, `` There has been no comment and there probably will not be a comment'' from the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> family <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Blakey </PERSON>, a professor of law at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Notre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dame </ORGANIZATION> and an expert on organized crime, said he found <PERSON> Exner </PERSON>'s story `` incredible.'' `` The president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> dealing directly with a mobster and no one knowing around him knowing about it?'' he asked. <PERSON> Blakey </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyer who worked for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee that investigated <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s assassination, said congressional investigators in the 1970s verified <PERSON> Exner </PERSON>'s reports of her affair with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. But, he said, `` my judgment was that she gave all the information she had at that time.''

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> stands behind Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> in the face of disclosure of a memo to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> about payments to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials `` which would be denied everywhere,'' the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said today. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was questioned by reporters about the memo, which was disclosed on Monday. Lawyers for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said the memo gave no reason to conclude that the attorney general knew of any plans to bribe <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials. `` <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has been a friend and adviser -LRB- of the president -RRB- for years and years going back to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` `` He knows him to be a man of integrity and he stands behind him.'' The memo from longtime <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> friend <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> described a plan to funnel a portion of some $ 650 million - $ 700 million from an Iraqi pipeline project to the Israeli Labor Party of then-Prime Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> The Wallach-Meese memo is the focal point of a criminal investigation of the attorney general. At issue is whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> knew of a possibly improper payment plan involving the Israeli political party and, if so, why he did nothing about it. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> turned aside most questions about the case, saying it was inappropriate to comment while it was under investigation by the independent counsel. Asked whether <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wanted <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to remain as attorney general, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` Absolutely. He's a good man who does good work.'' `` The president has full confidence in the attorney general and we do n't have any comment on the documents or the case,'' the spokesman said. Swiss oilman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> was a partner in the proposed pipeline and <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was his lawyer. Backers of the project were seeking assurances that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would not bomb the $ 1 billion pipeline, which was to run through <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s Sept. 25, 1985, memo to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> had confirmed with <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> that `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will receive somewhere between $ 65 - $ 70 million a year for ten years out of the conclusion of this project. `` What was also indicated to me, and which would be denied everywhere, is that a portion of those funds will go directly to Labor,'' said the two-page memo which <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> marked `` personal & amp; confidential _ for your eyes, only.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s lawyers released the memo Monday, along with a handwritten note from <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> in which the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leader said of the pipeline project: `` I would go a long way to help it out. But then discretion is demanded on our part.'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said today that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> never opposed laying an Iraqi pipeline through <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, `` So why would anyone need to use bribes?'' The foreign minister told reporters as he toured a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city that `` no new documents were published that cause me concern and I have nothing to say.'' But he added, `` We all agree that we favor the laying of the pipeline. So why would anyone need to use bribes? Nobody said he -LRB- <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> -RRB- gave the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> anything or proposed anything to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, who had initially denied that he had written a letter to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney general, said Sunday that he used the highly unusual diplomatic channel of going through <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` because I was approached by people who told me that the attorney general will deal with it.'' In his letter to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said `` I have asked my friend <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> -RRB- and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> -RRB- to let you know the whole story and I shall depend on your judgment about the best way to handle this matter.'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> denies he was offered a bribe or anything of value in connection with the pipeline project. Independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, who has been investigating the attorney general since last May 11, is trying to determine whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. That law prohibits <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens from bribing foreign officials and gives the attorney general responsibility for enforcing the ban. In releasing the memo, one of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s lawyers, <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON>, said in a lengthy statement that `` no one can fairly infer that Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> or anyone else reading the document should have understood that there was a ` bribe' or ` payoff' scheme to obtain the Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s support for the pipeline project.'' `` The words ` which would be denied everywhere' did not imply illegality of any kind,'' <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> added. `` The fact that <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> intended to provide large amounts of financial support to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, or that through some other governmental arrangement the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would be receiving indirectly some of the project's proceeds, could cause political embarrassment in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and was obviously not a matter to be publicized,'' the statement said. `` Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> frequently used colorful phrases suggesting intrigue and secrecy in his memoranda, even on subjects that were patently innocuous.'' <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> said `` the most reasonable inference'' is that `` <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>, who had been a substantial financial supporter of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, would be sharing the large amounts of money he would receive as a result of the ` oil lifter rights' he held with the government of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and with the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' The oil lifter rights placed <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> in control of the actual production and sale of the oil. In return, <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> was to make available to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> substantial amounts of the oil generated from the pipeline. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> eventually backed out of the pipeline project and it was not built. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has said he does n't recall reading the reference in the <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> memo to payments to <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' political party. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> declined to comment on the newly released documents at a news conference Monday in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, where he was attending a meeting of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s lawyers said they decided to release the material because `` speculation in the media ... has so greatly exceeded reasonable bounds that the usual policy of confidentiality gives the public a misleading impression.'' The documents reveal that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was urging <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to take an active role in the project. In a second Wallach-Meese memo released Monday, <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> hinted that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> might speak to Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> about the project and that the involvement of then-National Security Adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> was needed. `` I know it goes without saying that a discussion of this subject with the President would be most desired, and I would think most effective,'' said <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s lawyers said the attorney general `` took none of the initiatives suggested by Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>.'' In a note to <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> dated Oct. 7, 1985, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> referred <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> to <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, saying <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had removed himself from the matter because he had worked for <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which was planning to build the project.

<HEAD>Court Limits Interior Authority to Allocate Water in Missouri
River Reservoirs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in a victory for three midwestern states, today limited the secretary of the interior's authority to allocate water stored in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> reservoirs The justices ruled unanimously that the <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> secretary exceeded his authority when in 1982 he approved a contract authorizing <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> ETSI </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to take water from <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oahe </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> for a coal slurry pipeline project. The court, in an opinion written by Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, said the 8th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> was correct when in 1986 it ruled that the secretary lacks the power to allocate for industrial use water stored in the river basin reservoirs. The reservoirs are not reclamation projects as defined by a 1944 federal flood control law giving the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> power to regulate reclamation and irrigation projects, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. Agreeing with the 8th Circuit court, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> was given primary authority over flood control and navigation under the 1944 act. Federal officials had to get permission from the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> before removing water from <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oahe </LOCATION> in 1982, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. The decision is a victory for officials in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, three states in the lower <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>. Those states had blocked the now-scraped pipeline project. As envisioned by the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ETSI </ORGANIZATION> would have moved Lake Oahe water to <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, where it would have been mixed with locally mined coal. The slurry then would have been piped for use in coal-fired steam generating power plants in the Southeast. Three states in the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> _ opposed the 8th Circuit court's ruling and had supported the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and <ORGANIZATION> ETSI </ORGANIZATION>. The upper basin states said the appeals court ruling deprived them of using water within their boundaries. When the case was aired before the justices last November, one lawyer portrayed it as a dispute `` between upper and lower basin states.'' The case is <ORGANIZATION> ETSI </ORGANIZATION> Pipeline Project vs. <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, 86-939 and 86-941.

<HEAD>Spring Car-Selling Push Starting: How to Cope</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Inserts new penultimate graf to explain that sticker named

 Spring is right around the corner and that can only mean one thing: car dealers putting on an extra push for sales. Well, OK, there are other signs of spring, among them the arrival of the first seed catalog, followed by robins and other birds to munch the seeds. But sales by auto dealerships are right up there. The average new car costs more than $ 12,000 and is generally the second most costly purchase made by Americans. And when that much money is involved, some time and effort is called for to get the most for the money. As with most things, be prepared. Car salesmen have a lot more practice at selling than most people do at buying, and allowing them to push you into a hasty decision can be a costly error. Think in advance about what kind of car you want and how much you can afford to pay, and make a trip to a library to check books and magazines on new car features and prices. Shopping around is important to get prices from various dealers, and make notes of the base cost they cite and the extra costs for options plus any dealer charges and other costs. If the car you want is n't available consider ordering one. It may take longer, but you can avoid paying for a lot of options you do n't want. And insist on negotiating on the price. Check with <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION>, for car prices. For a charge, <ORGANIZATION> CU </ORGANIZATION> will provide a printout on any type of auto, citing the dealer's actual cost for the car and options. Knowing this information can give you a real negotiating edge. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has put together a new car buying guide for shoppers, which includes a handy worksheet for shoppers to compare prices and options they want. Copies of the `` New Car Buying Guide'' are available at no charge from the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Branch </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, 6th Street and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ave. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, 20580. A variety of auto-related booklets are also available from the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pueblo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, 81009. These include `` Buying a Used Car,' item 440T, 50 cents; `` A Consumer's Guide to Vehicle Leasing,'' item 441T, 50 cents, and `` Cost of Owning and Operating Autos and Vans,'' item 442T, 50 cents. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION>'s new car guide includes a helpful list of price terms that you should know when negotiating. These include: Invoice Price: The manufacturer's initial charge to the dealer. This is usually higher than the dealer's final cost because dealers often receive rebates, allowances, discounts and incentive awards. The invoice price always includes freight -LRB- also known as destination and delivery -RRB-. If you are buying a car based on the invoice price, be sure freight is not added to the sales contract. Base Price: The cost of the car without options, but including the standard equipment, factory warranty and freight. Monroney Sticker Price: This is the price on the label attached to the car window and is required by law. It shows the base price, the manufacturers installed options with the manufacturer suggested retail price, the manufacturer's transportation charge and the fuel economy. This label may not be removed by anyone other than the buyer. The Monroney Sticker Price was named for the late Sen. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroney </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., who sponsored the legislation requiring it Dealer Sticker Price: Usually on a supplemental sticker, this is the <ORGANIZATION> Monroney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sticker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Price </ORGANIZATION> plus the suggested retail price of dealer-installed options, additional dealer markup, additional dealer profit, dealer preparation and undercoating.

<HEAD>39 Percent of IRS Answers In Error: GAO</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> auditors said today a very preliminary survey indicates taxpayers are getting correct responses only 61 percent of the time when they telephone tax questions to the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. However, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, which conducted the survey, acknowledged that it is so incomplete that the results may not be valid. <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that a much more thorough check, by the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> itself, has found telephone `` assistors'' are giving the correct answer 74.8 percent of the time. `` We are obviously not satisfied with answering three out of four questions correctly at this time,'' <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> said. `` We are not, however, totally surprised by our figures. ... The large number of tax law changes this year was bound to challenge our assistors despite our training and planning efforts.'' The commissioner noted that it is not just <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> employees who are having trouble finding all the correct answers. He cited a survey of 50 tax professionals who came up with 50 different answers when asked by Money magazine to calculate the taxes owed by a hypothetical family. <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> noted that the 74.8-percent accuracy rate by <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> telephone answerers this year compares with a 79-percent mark in a <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> survey last year, before most provisions of the landmark 1986 tax overhaul had taken effect. <PERSON> Jennie </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stathis </PERSON>, associate director of the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, an investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, told the subcommittee that `` under the circumstances, we believe <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> did a good job in trying to prepare its employees and the taxpaying public for the 1988 filing season.'' She said auditors found that 84 percent of taxpayers who visited <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> walk-in facilities for help with their tax returns were satisfied with the assistance and that 74 percent received help within 15 minutes. However, Ms. <PERSON> Stathis </PERSON> said, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> found `` the need for <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> to improve the accuracy of telephone assistor responses to assure that returns are completed accurately and processed timely. She ackowledged that the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, in checking the accuracy of <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> telephone assistors, had made only 224 calls over six days, and said the results were so preliminary that they could not be projected as an accurate sampling. Those calls produced correct responses 61 percent of the time, although 4 percent were not complete. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> survey is continuing, as is the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>' own effort to check how its employees are doing. In contrast, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> finding of 74.8 percent accuracy is based on more than 5,000 calls.

 A drifter shot two plainclothes policemen with one of their guns in a struggle on a downtown street, then took refuge in an office building where he held six hostages before surrendering, police said. Police Officer <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorrell </PERSON>, 33, was shot in the head and was in serious condition today after surgery at <ORGANIZATION> Brooke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, hospital spokesman staff Sgt. King <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> said. Officer <PERSON> Onofre </PERSON> <PERSON> Serna </PERSON>, 26, suffered a graze to the chest area and was in stable condition at <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> said. The suspect, identified as <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 28, was charged with two counts of attempted capital murder and was in <LOCATION> Bexar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> in lieu of $ 1 million bond, said police spokesman Sgt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Buske </PERSON>. After the scuffle Monday night with the policemen, the gunman ran into a nearby office building and took the hostages, <PERSON> Buske </PERSON> said. `` The officers stopped the individual ... and a struggle ensued. One of the officers lost his weapon. -LRB- The suspect -RRB- picked up the weapon and several shots were fired,'' <PERSON> Buske </PERSON> said. Police Chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said the man made no demands when he took the hostages. <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said he did n't know immediately why the officers stopped him. The gunman fled into the Travis Park Plaza building, took two people hostage on one floor, released them, and then took three other people hostage on the third floor. The three escaped when the gunman walked into another area to take a sixth hostage, <PERSON> Buske </PERSON> said. The gunman surrendered to police shortly before 10 p.m., about an hour after he released the last hostage, following talks with police negotiators, said <PERSON> Buske </PERSON>. `` He seemed disoriented at first, despondent, that he had gotten framed,'' hostage <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Renaud </PERSON> said today. `` He said he was n't there to hurt us He said he just needed a place to hide out for the night.'' The man was described as a street person by City Manager <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>. `` My understanding is he -LRB- the gunman -RRB- had some mental problems and it's your typical downtown problem that we've been faced with,'' <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gorrell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Serna </PERSON> were part of a downtown foot patrol aimed at deterring street crime; <PERSON> Buske </PERSON> described the patrol as effective in combating downtown muggings. Last month, a mentally ill homeless man shot and killed a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police officer in a downtown parking lot. The killing touched off a wave of public support for police when <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> blamed some <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members for creating an atmosphere that led to the shooting by criticizing police.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The House Foreign Affairs Committee today approved a resolution of support for <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON>'s upcoming elections, but only after lawmakers expressed reservations about the country's human rights record. On a voice vote, the panel approved a resolution noting <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts since 1979 to establish a constitutional system that institutionalizes an electoral process, and recognizing the large turnout in 1984 for the election of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, despite threats of violence. The resolution, sent to the full House for a vote, `` expresses confidence that the people of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> will reject efforts to disrupt the election'' scheduled for March 20 to select national legislators and local officials. Past elections have been plagued by threats of disruption and warnings to voters not to participate made by the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which is waging a guerrilla war against the <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> government.

 A federal judge ruled today that a confession by a suspected Lebanese Shiite terrorist that he had led the 1985 hijacking of a Jordanian airliner was illegally obtained by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, who sharply criticized the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s interrogation, suppressed the oral and written confessions that <PERSON> Fawaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> made to federal agents following his Sept. 13, 1987, arrest in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> after he was lured aboard an FBI-chartered yacht off <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>, a former member of the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia, is scheduled to stand trial March 22 on charges he had led the June 11, 1985, hijacking of a Royal Jordanian airliner from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The plane was flown to several points in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> and destroyed by explosives the next day after passengers and crew were taken off the jetliner. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> ruled that fractures <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> suffered on both wrists when he was slammed to the deck of the yacht by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents, plus seasickness, made it impossible for him to waive rationally his rights against self-incrimination. The judge also noted that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> deliberately kept <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ammunition ship for four days during which he underwent `` relentless interrogation.'' `` The defendant's will was overborne by the interrogation and his capacity for self-determination was critically impaired,'' the judge said. The judge sharply criticized the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> for taking four days to transport <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> from the yacht where he was seized to an aircraft carrier from which he was flown to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for arraignment before a federal magistrate. `` The slow voyage across the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> appeared to serve only the government's purposes _ ample time to educe a confession. This was a clear abuse of the obligation to bring the defendant before a judiciali officer immediately following his arrest,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> said the agency had no immediate comment on <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s decision. Federal prosecutors have other evidence against <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>, including a videotape of him reading a statement to reporters before the plane was blown up at the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport. Two Americans who were aboard the plane when it was stormed by five gunmen carrying AK-47 assault rifles have identified <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> as leader of the hijackers. In addition, the prosecutors will be able to use the testimony of <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamdan </PERSON>, a friend of <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> who lured him to the FBI-chartered yacht off <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> on the pretext of completing a drug deal. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> found that <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> `` was in an extremely weakened physical condition at the very time when he was explained his rights. In an uncertain physical condition, in an oppressive environment, and subject to relentless interrogation, <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> lacked the will necessary to voluntarily waive his rights.'' The judge noted that `` the government had deliberately scheduled four days for the voyage across the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>; four days which <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> would be subjected to constant questioning by agents.'' While ruling the confession was illegally obtained, <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> dismissed a defense motion that <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>'s arrest was illegal.

 A white supremacist group considered dumping enough cyanide to kill 440,000 people into the water supplies of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, to create civil unrest, the group's former leader testified. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>, a key prosecution witnesses in the trial of 10 men accused of plotting the violent overthrow of the government, said one of the defendants, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Miles </PERSON>, gave him a 30-gallon barrel of cyanide and declared: `` The ones who would be killed would not really matter. It would be a good cleansing.'' <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> also testified that in 1983, members of a white supremacist group he led had participated in a murder, robberies and attempts to blow up utility facilities. <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> is serving 20 years for racketeering and weapons violations committed when he led the Arkansas-based religious-military group, called the Covenant, the Sword and the Arm of the Lord. He was arrested in 1985 after a four-day standoff. <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>, 47, said Monday he agreed to cooperate with prosecutors after the government agreed to relocate and give new identities to the two women he considers to be his wives and to his nine children. Miles and nine others are charged with conspiracy to overthrow the government by force. The government alleges that they and four others on trial, including <ORGANIZATION> Aryan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, espouse white supremacist goals or belong to white supremacist groups. Those four, and one of the accused conspirators, are charged with plotting to kill a federal judge and an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent. Two are also accused of interstate transportation of stolen money. All the defendants face maximum sentences of 20 years in prison and $ 20,000 fines on each charge if convicted. Returning to the witness stand today, <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Snell </PERSON>, a member of his group, murdered <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stumpp </PERSON> on Nov. 11, 1983, in the robbery of a pawn shop that <PERSON> Stumpp </PERSON> operated in <LOCATION> Texarkana </LOCATION>, Ark. `` This is what they were doing at that time,'' <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> said, referring to occasional forays involving robberies and attempts to disrupt utilities. <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> said he asked <PERSON> Snell </PERSON> later why <PERSON> Snell </PERSON> had killed <PERSON> Stumpp </PERSON>. `` He said that he was an evil man, he was a Jew, and that he just needed to die,'' <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> testified. <PERSON> Snell </PERSON>, one of the defendants in the case, is on death row in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> for the murder of <PERSON> Stumpp </PERSON>, and is serving a sentence of life without parole for the 1984 slaying of state Trooper <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> said the robberies were undertaken because of an agreement made in 1983 at <LOCATION> Hayden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, by himself and leaders of other white-supremacist groups to take action designed to bring down the government so that an all-white state could be established in the nation's <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>. In his testimony Monday, <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> described how defendants <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> and his son <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> solicited the group's help to find and kill <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Waters </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Special Agent <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Knox </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> Fayetteville </LOCATION>. He said the Wades wanted to avenge the slaying of a fugitive tax protester, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahl </PERSON>, who was killed along with an <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> sheriff in a 1983 shootout with federal authorities at a house on land owned by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. <PERSON> Knox </PERSON> helped prosecute people who harbored <PERSON> Kahl </PERSON>, and Waters presided over the trial. <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> urged that local officials involved in <PERSON> Kahl </PERSON>'s death `` be hanged publicly from the lamp post there in <LOCATION> Smithville </LOCATION>.'' The idea, <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> said, was to make an example of them so that other officials would not take similar actions. <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Miles </PERSON>, 63, of <LOCATION> Cohoctah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, gave him the barrel of cyanide after <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> participated in a survivalist conference in <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, in 1981. <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> said he also received some chemicals to make explosives and rocket propellant. He said he was wary of transporting it, but <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> told him, `` You might need it sometime. It will kill a lot of people.'' The government says the cyanide was enough to kill 440,000 people. <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> testified that he, <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> and defendants <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, 69, of <LOCATION> Hayden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, discussed in 1983 using the cyanide to poison the water supplies of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, in an attempt to create public unrest and show the government was powerless.

 <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> has deemed Barbra Streisand nuts. Not exactly. But as Dr. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> in the movie, `` Nuts,'' <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> portrays a psychiatrist who is truly convinced that <PERSON> Claudia </PERSON> <PERSON> Draper </PERSON>, a former call girl accused of murder, is insane and therefore must be locked away. Streisand, as <PERSON> Draper </PERSON>, believes otherwise. `` As a heavy I am not well liked in the movie,'' <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> said. `` But I approached the character with the conviction that he is a professional and he made this diagnosis based on years of experience. The more this girl rants and raves, the more I am convinced of my diagnosis.'' The consummate professional, <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> has brought to the screen more than 40 years of acting experience. `` You know, originally I prepared for a teaching career, but due to several circumstances I missed the exam,'' he said. `` So I decided to do what I most wanted to do and that was to act.'' He began his career with a scholarship to the Neighborhood Playhouse in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and made his first appearance in the Equity Library production of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' `` This Property Is Condemned.'' This became an important turning point in <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s life, for the only other performer in the show happened to be the actress, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who later became his wife. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> made his Broadway debut in 1945 in `` Skydrift'' a short-lived production. But soon thereafter, he was cast in the Broadway production of `` Mister Roberts,'' which starred <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> and ran for two years. He then went on to receive a Tony award for <ORGANIZATION> Tennesse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION>' `` The Rose Tattoo. `` It's a shame that shows have become so expensive here in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, because we would have less problems if everybody were able to go to the theater _ rich, poor, black, white, minorities _ everbody,'' he said. `` Theater is not a luxury but a necessity, for theater helps people understand the human condition.'' This belief in the power of theater to reach out to people has led <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> through many plays in his long career, including `` Camino Real,'' `` <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> VIII </PERSON>,'' `` <PERSON> Antony </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cleopatra </PERSON>,'' `` Waltz of the <ORGANIZATION> Toreadors </ORGANIZATION>,'' `` Luv'' and `` The Teahouse of the August Moon.'' <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s movie career began with <PERSON> Elia </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazan </PERSON>'s debut as a director in `` Baby Doll'' in 1956, for which he won <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s highest film acting honor `` I used to sneer at the screen,'' <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> said, `` then I realized how hard it is. `` A movie has many layers _ the director wields the baton and I play the instrument. Although it's a lot of hard work, I have fun and that's important. `` Let me tell you this,'' he continued. `` The most important things in life are the right partner and your work. If you find a lifelong partner and you love your work, you are a most fortunate person.'' The 72-year-old <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> has indeed been fortunate. He and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> have raised two daughters and a son. He has also appeared in aproximately 50 motion pictures since `` Baby Doll.'' He is most recognized for his role in the spaghetti Western, `` The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.'' `` People all over the world still come up to me on the streets and mention that movie with <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON>,'' he said. His other films include `` The Magnificent Seven,'' `` The Misfits,'' `` How the West Was Won,'' `` Cinderella Liberty,'' `` The Deep'' and `` Tough Guys.'' His most recent TV appearances include `` The Executioner's Song'' and an <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> movie, `` The Impossible Spy. Even though he's busy with films and television _ he's also a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trucks </ORGANIZATION> _ he still manages to keep one foot in the theater. `` I am like a farmer who rotates his crops, I always allocate a certain period of my time to go back to my roots _ the theater.''

 President <PERSON> Yoweri </PERSON> <PERSON> Museveni </PERSON> reshuffled his Cabinet for the second time since coming to power in 1986 and created three new posts for deputy prime ministers, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Uganda </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday.

 The week's campaign marked something of a break between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s intensive leadoff primary a week ago and the highly visible Southern contests ahead. But for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, it marked an opportunity to demonstrate strength on the heels of his <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> loss, and he taunted the vice president for not competing. `` I do n't know where <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is,'' he said in <LOCATION> Duluth </LOCATION>. `` We're going to send him a map of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> so at least he gets a little idea where it is.'' But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s aides wanted no part of two states so close to <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, where the vice president finished a humbling third in caucuses two weeks ago. Instead the vice president spent his time in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, which votes on March 5, and in several Super Tuesday states. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> enjoyed the support of Sen. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON> and Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mickelson </PERSON> and was a prohibitive favorite in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. He looked for a boost from <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, as well, but sounded less confident of a victory there. Party officials said <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> was tailor-made for a <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> surprise, noting his earlier success in organizational contests such as <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, where he finished a surprising second, and in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, which he won. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> also was well known in the state because his one-time television program was viewed widely. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, his candidacy on the ropes after a weak third place finish in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, purchased television advertising at the last minute in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. His aides conceded in advance that <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> looked like a lost cause because of <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s presumed strength. Among the Democrats, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary winner <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> dreamed of a two-state sweep Midwestern sweep that would clearly establish him as a candidate with national appeal. His rivals said he spent a fortune organizing <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, leaving <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> in his wake. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> was another story _ and a heated one. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, anxious for a victory, aired television commercials attacking the governor. The <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman also won the endorsement of Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON>, and rushed a commercial onto the air trumpeting the news. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> responded with a late radio advertisement responding to the attacks and pointing out that <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> accepts political action committee campaign funds. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> also invested in television advertising in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> to redeem his earlier declaration that he needed to demonstrate strength outside the South. Despite his initial statement that he needed a win this week to stay in the race, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> changed course and vowed to fight for the `` heart and soul'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> until the convention. His aides conceded no victories were likely in either <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made little effort in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, but worked hard in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> in hopes of matching his double-digit showing in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses next door. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said in advance he would stay in the race no matter where he finished.

 British travelers will no longer need a visa to visit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> next year, officials of both countries said Tuesday. The decision soothes a long-standing British irritation, since <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> does not require <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visitors to have similar visas. Officials said the change is part of a pilot program to drop visa requirements for eight countries, beginning with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. They would not identify the other six. `` There are a number of technical issues to be settled but we hope the new arrangement can come into force at the turn of the year,'' said a spokesman for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy official said less than 2 percent of British and Japanese visitors cause problems on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visits, such as abusing the length of stay. When the program is implemented, British travelers will be required to have only a valid passport and a return ticket and can stay in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for a maximum of 90 days. They will still be required to apply for a visa to work or live in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, that last year the embassy issued 690,000 non-immigrant visas to Britons. He said the number of British visitors was even higher because some traveled on multiple-entry visas. This year, the embassy expects to process 900,000 such visas, he said.

 A four-day sickout by 110 <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> firefighters ended today when the firefighters returned to work after being threatened with contempt of court. But 35 of the firefighters were cited with contempt anyway by <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Americo </PERSON> <PERSON> Campanella </PERSON> because they did not show up in court Monday to explain why they were absent over the weekend. <PERSON> Campanella </PERSON> said there was no evidence that the firefighters had not acted in concert to stay off the job in violation of a back-to-work order issued Saturday by another judge. He said he would decide on penalties at a later time. The city had asked for the contempt citations even though the sickout was over in order to prevent something similar from happening in the future, said city labor attorney <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Ragosta </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. State law prohibits public safety employees from striking `` Everything's back to normal,'' Fire Chief <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moise </PERSON> said today. Eighty-seven firefighters who reported for duty Friday evening were kept on the job during the sickout over a contract dispute. No major fires occurred in the city during the four-day period. On Monday, <PERSON> Campanella </PERSON> postponed a hearing after <PERSON> Ragosta </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firefighters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, indicated that relatively few members of the union had been notified of the temporary restraining order issued by another <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge at the city's request Saturday. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> testified he was only able to reach about half the 50 firefighters scheduled to work Sunday. <PERSON> Ragosta </PERSON> said the city served notices of the restraining order on 129 firefighters. Another 36 were notified of Monday's contempt hearing. The union represents 450 of the city's total uniformed force of 479. The dispute apparently concerns language in a contract ratified by firefighters in December that the city has yet to sign. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> asserts the city is trying to renege on a provision that calls for an officer to be placed in charge of each rescue unit. Union members also complain that promises to replace worn-out or damaged equipment like boots, helmets and firecoats have not been fulfilled. All but one of the 51 firefighters scheduled to report for work at 8 a.m. Saturday called in sick, <PERSON> Moise </PERSON> testified Monday. Sixty others called in sick for the shift that was supposed to begin at 6 a.m. Sunday, <PERSON> Moise </PERSON> said.

 Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is as stubborn as a mule and ca n't govern the state, former Sen. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> said today as he became honorary chairman man of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>' Republican gubernatorial bid. <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>, who backed <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, a fellow Republican, during the 1986 campaign, said at a news conference today that the endorsement was a mistake. `` He screwed up too much ... He turned out wrong,'' <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> told reporters. `` You look back over all the governors that we've had in this state,'' said the senator, who has been considered the patriarch of the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> GOP. `` We'' ve had some darn good ones and we've had some mediocre ones, but it took us a long time to get a really bad one.'' Nonetheless, <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> will be difficult to beat in the May 17 recall election because he still has a strong core of support despite the governor's indictment on criminal charges and upcoming impeachment trial. <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>, a former 30-year congressman, will face <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> in the recall vote. <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> contended <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was too wrapped up in defending himself against the impeachment and criminal charges during recent months to spend much time governing the state. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> gave up the acting governorship to Democrat Rose Mofford when he was impeached on Feb. 5. His Senate trial is scheduled to begin Monday on charges of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan, misusing $ 80,000 from the governor's protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership, and trying to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat by a state official. Even if he could solve his legal problems, however, <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> said he does not believe <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> can govern the state. `` He is a very obstinate man,'' <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> said. `` I used to drive mules and he's a lot like a mule.'' <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> said he does n't see much difference between <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, except that he believes <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> has more experience.

<HEAD>Indian Troops Kill 20 Tamils After Four Troops Killed in Ambush</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Indian troops shot and killed 20 Tamil civilians Tuesday after four soldiers died in a ambush by Tamil rebels, Sri Lankan military officials said. The civilians were killed after an Indian army officer and three soldiers died in the ambush in <LOCATION> Kuthukudiuppu </LOCATION>, a northeastern village in the <LOCATION> Mullaitivu </LOCATION> district about 173 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, the officials said. The Sri Lankan officials could not be identified in accordance with briefing rules. A spokeswoman for the Indian High Commission, or embassy, denied any Tamil civilians were killed. She said the body of one Tamil rebel was recovered and at least 10 more rebels were believed killed. Authorities clamped an indefinite curfew on the district after the violence broke out, the Sri Lankan officials said. They said there were reports of heavy air activity by Indian troops. More than 45,000 Indian troops are stationed in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> to disarm Tamil militants opposed to a peace accord signed last July, which grants some autonomy to minority Tamils. The Tamils constitute 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people. Tamils say they are discriminated against by the majority <PERSON> Sinhalese </PERSON>, who control the government and the army. The most powerful Tamil rebel group, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, has been battling Indian troops since last October in the northern and eastern provinces, where most of the Tamils live. Also on Tuesday, Sinhalese extremists stabbed a police constable and a security officer guarding an injured Sinhalese militant inside the <ORGANIZATION> Colombo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, a police spokesman said. He said both victims were in serious condition. The attackers are believed to be members of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, an ultra-nationalist organization of the majority Sinhalese people that also opposes the peace accord They escaped with their injured comrade. On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> members raided a Sri Lankan army camp northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, killing two soldiers. The attackers escaped with two Chinese-made T-56 automatic rifles and 120 rounds of ammunition. The group has vowed to kill anyone who supports the Indian-Sri Lankan accord, claiming it grants too many concessions to the Tamils. Sinhalese extremists already have killed more than 150 people since the accord was signed. Last year, attackers believed to be members of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> killed a popular Sri Lankan film stars and politician, <PERSON> Vijaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumaranatunga </PERSON>, who supported the peace pact.

Pledged delegates: 78 Super delegates: 9 Total delegates: 87 Delegates allocated: Tuesday, February 23 Selection of delegates: Sunday, May 1 and Sunday, June 12 <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> plan to pick national convention delegates through a four-tier caucus-convention system, beginning with precinct caucuses on Feb 23. The precinct caucuses will elect delegates to the county conventions, which elect delegates to the congressional district and state conventions. Under an agreement reached with the national party, the results of the presidential preference vote at the precinct caucuses will not be tabulated until March 8. This was to end a confrontation over the state's insistence on holding its leadoff event on Feb. 23, two weeks earlier than allowed by national party rules. The two sides remained at odds until a few weeks ago over a plan by <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s secretary of state to compile a poll of the presidential preferences of delegates elected to the county conventions. The state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has agreed it would lend no help to conducting the poll on precinct caucus night. Those figures, which technically have no binding effect, were to be gathered by thousands of volunteers recruited by the secretary of state. The state's 51 pledged national convention delegates from congressional districts will be chosen and allocated at the congressional district conventions scheduled for April 29-May 1. The rest of the state's 27 pledged delegates will be chosen and allocated among presidential candidates at the state party convention June 10-12. Former Vice President <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, the Democratic presidential nominee in 1984, automatically will be seated as a delegate because of his position as a former party leader.

<HEAD>Residents Not Sure About New Homes Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TCHULA, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Officials have a big selling job to do in this improverished town if 30 families are to get new homes, the mayor says. The families living in old shacks, rusting trailers and leaning houses on <LOCATION> Tchula </LOCATION>'s north side are to get new homes in about a year, but Mayor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotten </PERSON> says it is going to be hard to convince some that officials are trying to improve their quality of life and not swindle them. `` They're scared and you ca n't blame them,'' <PERSON> Cotten </PERSON> said. `` The most devastating thing to fight is ignorance.'' <PERSON> Cotten </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Espy </PERSON> were on hand Monday for a ground-breaking ceremony on the site of a burned-out house in the middle of a four-block strip targeted for revitalization. `` We're going to be tearing these down,'' <PERSON> Cotten </PERSON> said of the stretch of homes. `` But this a drop in the bucket. We want to change the face of <LOCATION> Tchula </LOCATION>. We want everyone to be a homeowner.'' When farmworkers are idle, unemployment in the central <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> town of 2,000 can reach 85 percent, <PERSON> Cotten </PERSON> said. Poor housing conditions are easily visible from the road. With a $ 695,832 community development block grant _ federal money allocated by the state _ city and state officials are to begin razing some homes in March and refurbishing others. In place of the homes to be torn down, 30 new single-family dwellings will be built. Residents who already own their land and homes will get the new homes free, and renters will have a chance to buy homes through low-interest programs, <PERSON> Cotten </PERSON> said. The city also will use the money to pay half the rent of displaced homeowners during the renovations. <PERSON> Lillie </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, 67, who lives alone in a home just a few feet from where ground was broken for the first new house, was suspicious of the plans. `` This house belongs to me and I do n't want my house torn down,'' said <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> as she sat on her porch. `` This house suits me all right.'' Another resident, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>, watched curiously from the road while officials spoke. `` Can they really take someone's home?'' he asked a bystander. `` It's nice but I do n't see why they should take people's property. The mayor said many will change their minds as they understand the program. `` We have a lot of people here with no education,'' <PERSON> Cotten </PERSON> said. `` There are many who think you're going to steal their land.''

 Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee Tuesday he had been dealt a low blow by <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> through <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>'s interpretation of why <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> opposes one of <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>'s ideas. <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> recommended that the panel not consider <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>'s request for funds for what he called the `` frivolous'' idea of removing the O'Shaughnessy Dam in <LOCATION> Hetch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hetchy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s Yosemite National Park and draining the reservoir behind the dam The dam provides three-quarters of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s water. The city earns about $ 38 million a year selling water and electricity from the reservoir. Rep. <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION>, said he found <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>'s idea `` strange,'' and he had been `` shocked if not surprised'' that <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> proposed it last year <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> read the opening paragraph of a news article about the feud between the two Cabinet secretaries describing <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>'s belief that <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> was opposing removal of the dam because <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> was concerned about what it would do to his job prospects in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` That's a low blow, is n't it?'' <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> said. `` It really is,'' <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> replied. `` What about this job you're going to get?'' <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> asked. `` I do n't know who fabricated that,'' <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> has said the <LOCATION> Hetch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hetchy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, filled by the reservoir from 1913 to 1923, could relieve some of the visitor pressure on <LOCATION> Yosemite </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, which attracts more than 2 million people a year. He has said the project could not be begun for years, but is asking for $ 600,000 in his budget for further studies. <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>, `` Your recommendation to this committee would be not to consider an appropriation which would result in a change in the status of Hetch Hetchy?'' <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> replied, `` That's my recommendation.'' `` As energy secretary, I am concerned about destroying an infrastructure that produces a substantial amount of electricity,'' he added. The generating capacity _ about 150 megawatts _ eventually will have to be replaced, `` and I just do n't think enough thought has been given to the economic consequences,'' <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said his department estimated that removal of the dam and restoration of the valley could cost $ 5 billion to $ 6 billion, `` a lot of money for a frivolous idea.''

 Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions taken Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. SECURITY CLEARANCES The court limited the job protection for government workers fired for lacking security clearances. By a 5-3 vote, the justices agreed with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration that the <ORGANIZATION> Merit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> lacks authority to decide whether the denial of security clearance is justified. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Egan </PERSON>, 86-1552. CRIMINAL IDENTIFICATION The court ruled that a criminal suspect's rights are not violated when a witness who is unable to identify the suspect in court testifies about an earlier identification of the accused. The justices, voting 6-2, ordered the reinstatement of the conviction of a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> prison inmate in the beating of a prison guard who suffered memory loss because of the attack. The case is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, 86-877. PENSION FUNDS The court ruled that businesses may not be sued in federal court for refusing to contribute to multi-employer union pension funds after a collective bargaining agreement expires. In an 8-0 ruling, the court rejected <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration arguments that barring lawsuits in such cases could undermine the solvency of the multi-employer pension plans. The case is Welfare Trust Fund vs. Advanced Lightweight Concrete, 85-2079. GULF COAST The court, rejecting claims by private landowners, ruled that the state of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> owns thousands of acres of oil - and gas-rich land near the state's <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> By a 5-3 vote, the justices said states may claim title to land beneath waters subject to the tie's influence _ and not only land under navigable waters. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> vs. <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, 86-870. MISSOURI RIVER BASIN The court, in a victory for three midwestern states, today limited the secretary of the interior's authority to allocate water stored in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> reservoirs.

<HEAD>Afghan Guerrillas Announce Plans for New Government</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Afghan insurgents announced plans Tuesday to replace the Communist regime with an Islamic government, which they said would promote peace and ensure the safe withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The guerrilla alliance said the civil war would not end until such a government was established to guide the way to a nation called `` The Islamic State of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> responded that a new government should be formed after the Soviets withdraw, and is a matter for `` Afghans alone.'' <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> radio quoted <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> as saying: `` No one can direct the Afghans on this ... or give their views.'' His comments appeared to reflect the government's position that the issue of a coalition government should be settled within <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, not by guerrilla leaders in neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Afghan guerrillas began fighting after a Communist coup in April 1978 and Soviet soldiers entered the country in December 1979. An estimated 115,000 now are in the country helping fight the insurgents. On Feb. 8, Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> offered to begin withdrawing troops May 15 if <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> reach agreement by March 15 in U.N.-sponsored negotiations that resume in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> next week. He said the pullout could be accompalished in 10 months. <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION>, an alliance of seven guerrilla groups, announced its plans for a government in a statement telexed from the border city of <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, calling for a 28-member cabinet to replace <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government. It said the government would consist of 14 ministers from the guerrilla leadership, seven representatives of Afghan refugees and `` seven Moslems presently living in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>.'' Insurgent leaders have said the Moslems in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> would include non-Communists in the current administration who have not been closely involved in the war. In a separate statement, alliance leader <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalis </PERSON> said: `` As long as a single Communist remains in power in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the regime will have to face the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> resistance. Until we have established an Islamic government, we will never lay down our arms.'' About 3.5 million Afghan refugees live in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Most are in border cities and camps that serve as bases and supply points for the guerrillas known as mujahedeen, or holy warriors. The alliance statement said a `` supreme council'' would be the government's highest body and oversee the cabinet. Its members would be leaders of the seven-party alliance based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, who would provide `` joint leadership during the interim period'' after moving to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. `` This government is proposed to replace the present regime in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> before the signing of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords under the auspices of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>,'' and would `` represent all sections of the Afghan nation,'' the announcement said. It said the chief cabinet minister also would be the head of state, but it did not say who would hold the post or name proposed cabinet members. Another organ of government would be a consultative council of 75 members _ two from each of the 28 provinces and 19 Moslem religious scholars, intellectuals and technocrats, the statement said. It said the council would make interim laws to apply until a new constitution was written. Provincial councils would be in charge of regional affairs. The statement said an independent election commission would supervise the election of a constituent assembly immediately after the Soviet withdrawal. In `` The Islamic State of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' the statement said, `` the Koran and Sunnah -LRB- teachings and practices of the Prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> -RRB- will be supreme.'' It said the country would be governed by an elected head of state and legislative assembly.

 A federal judge has ordered an investigation into why a doctor waited two months to disclose that one of three hemophiliac brothers exposed to the AIDS virus had been diagnosed with AIDS-related complex. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovachevich </PERSON> said in a court order Monday that she has `` grave concerns'' with Dr. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbosa </PERSON>'s statements to the press that he withheld the diagnosis out of respect for the privacy of the family of <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> In a medical report filed Feb. 12, <PERSON> Barbosa </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON>, 11 and the oldest of the brothers, was diagnosed with ARC, AIDS-related complex. <PERSON> Barbosa </PERSON>, a physician at All Children's Hospital in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petersburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that he knew of the diagnosis in December but did n't report it out of concern for the <ORGANIZATION> Rays </ORGANIZATION>' privacy, the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. `` I left out a number of things on purpose,'' the Times quoted the doctor as saying. In her order, Ms. <PERSON> Kovachevich </PERSON> asked a magistrate to find out what the doctor told a <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reporter and who was aware of <PERSON> Barbosa </PERSON>'s `` intentional omissions from the medical reports and when they were aware of the omissions.'' In addition, she said she wanted to know whether attorneys told the court any contradictory medical information and whether an independent doctor should be appointed. Last August, the judge ordered the <ORGANIZATION> DeSoto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to reinstate the three <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> boys _ <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Randy </PERSON>. The brothers, all hemophiliacs, were barred from class after they tested positive for antibodies associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. During a hearing last summer, doctors said the boys probably were contaminated through plasma products used to clot their blood and showed no symptoms of having the disease. The AIDS virus can remain dormant for years. ARC is found when the virus causes a set of symptoms that usually are considered a precursor to AIDS. <PERSON> Barbosa </PERSON> said in his Feb. 12 report that <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON>'s condition appeared to be stable. The boy has been treated with AZT, an anti-AIDS drug. The Ray boys' medical records are supposed to be on public file as a condition of the August injunction that returned them to school. The family, however, fled <LOCATION> DeSoto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> a week after classes began because of a parental boycott, bomb threats that emptied the school and a deliberate blaze that destoyed their home. They now live in <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION>, where the boys enrolled in school without objection from school officials, although some parents objected. AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.

 Former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> became an honorary knight Tuesday, joining the illustrious ranks of the defenders of Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s realm. The queen herself bestowed the medals on <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> in a simple ceremony at <LOCATION> Buckingham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION>, but it does n't mean he can call himself `` Sir <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON>.'' `` <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> GBE'' will have to do. In recommending him for the highest royal honor <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> gives to foreigners, Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government was thanking <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> for his defense of British interests, especially during the 1982 Falkland Islands War with <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, when <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> provided <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> with crucial intelligence and logistics support. But the unassuming <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> professed amazement at the accolade. When a reporter asked why he thought he had received it, he replied: `` I have n't the faintest idea.'' <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> skipped the pomp and pageantry of a public investiture at Buckingham Palace, in which the queen would have placed a ribbon of medals over his head before an audience of hundreds. Instead, he chose a 25-minute private audience with the queen attended only by his wife, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>, and Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, who had recommended him for the honorary knighthood. As a foreigner, <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> did n't have to bow or scrape before the queen. `` Her Majesty was nice enough just to present it to me,'' he said, pointing to the blue box he was holding. <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> opened it for photographers, showing them the gold cross of the Order of the British Empire and the silver star of a Knight Grand Cross, the highest order of chivalry for a foreigner. He did not put them on. `` I'm very honored, very pleased and still very astonished,'' said <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, who retired Nov. 5 after nearly seven years as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s defense chief. When the award was announced on Feb. 1, reporters asked 70-year-old <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> whether he was ready to be called `` Sir Cap.'' He replied: `` Good God, no! Our Constitution has some harsh words about titles. But I really am flattered.'' Actually, the title of `` sir'' is reserved for British subjects. <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> was the 56th American to receive an honorary knighthood but only the second to receive a GBE. The other Knight Grand Cross was awarded in 1976 to <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>, president and chairman of Pilgrims of the <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, an Anglo-American friendship society. Other Americans who have been made Knights of the British Empire, a lower rank of chivalry, include President <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>, former Secretary of State Dean <PERSON> Rusk </PERSON>, industrialist <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, philanthropists <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellon </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Getty </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, actors <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairbanks </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Poitier </PERSON> and former Sen. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulbright </PERSON>, D-Ark., who headed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations Committee The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> was being knighted for his `` outstanding and invaluable contribution'' to Anglo-American defense cooperation, especially his `` unfailing support and assistance'' during <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 74-day campaign to oust <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s invasion force from the Falklands <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> refused to say whether the queen had spoken about the Falklands or defense. `` She was very gracious as always and very generous in her remarks,'' he said, without elaborating. The private meeting took place in The Queen's Audience Room, where the 61-year-old monarch has weekly talks with Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and occasionally meets other officials. It contains a piano and the blue walls are filled with paintings including two Canalettos and two Gainsboroughs. <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, who counts <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> among his heroes, has longstanding ties to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. He made his debut as a British television commentator in December, when the treaty which he helped secure eliminating shorter - and medium-range missiles was signed, and he will be spending four weeks this summer as a distinguished visiting professor at <ORGANIZATION> Edinburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> Asked whether the honorary knighthood had made him more of an Anglophile, <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> replied: `` Well, it's hard to be not.'' He then drove off with his wife to celebrate at a luncheon given by <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador Charles Price II.

<TEXT>
 The U.S.-Soviet treaty eliminating medium-range nuclear missiles from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> wo n't hurt <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to provide high-tech military help to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, the chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiator said Tuesday. `` This treaty does not prohibit the transfer of technology,'' <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON> testified before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON>'s detailed analysis was part of a thorough examination of the pact signed 10 weeks ago by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The treaty will eliminate all nuclear-tipped missiles with ranges of about 300 to 3,000 miles. Committee members say the detailed scrutiny is needed because of disputes about the meaning of past treaties, particularly the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. The current treaty is being considered by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> amid a fight between the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration over the precise meaning of the 1972 pact and whether it banned futuristic weapons such as those being developed under the Strategic Defense Initiative. Article 14 of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces -LRB- INF -RRB- treaty says neither side shall do anything, now or in the future, to undercut the pact. Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, R-Ind., told <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON> that `` I'm concerned about article 14'' because it might limit future <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> help to other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations `` If we do n't spell out what the future obligations are,'' said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, `` down the road I can foresee some problems ... now is the time to give us as much running room as possible in the future for our technology.'' But <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON> took the opposite approach, noting that the treaty is extremely specific in spelling out prohibited weapons, along with their components. `` If it is not prohibited by the treaty, we can do it,'' said <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON>. Later, he added that `` we're best protected by stating what we can not do.'' <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON> said the voluminous negotiating record is the best defense against future disputes about what is, and is not, covered by the treaty. He opposed suggestions by <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and other senators that some type of amendment is needed to clarify Article 14. The section is a standard clause which has been added to other treaties and it simply restates the intention of both nations to abide by the pact, <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON> cited one method in which he said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> would not be affected. The treaty bans cruise missiles, he said, but it does n't block the transfer of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technology to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations such as <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to develop cruise missiles. <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiating team resisted Soviet efforts to block <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> help for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. `` We knew their goal was to find a way to put a brake on <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> activities,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> promised Tuesday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will do its part to ensure that the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance remains strong, saying in an address broadcast to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that `` our destiny is coupled with yours.'' In the address, which came a week before a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit meeting, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> reaffirmed the alliance agreement that an attack on any member nation is an attack against all of them. `` Simply put, an attack on <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> is the same as an attack on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>,'' he said.

 A top <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> official admitted today that some agents came `` very close'' to conducting a political investigation of anti-Reagan activists, but denied they intended to do so or received any instructions from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Revell </PERSON>, executive assistant director, told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel there were legitimate reasons to investigate the Committee In Solidarity with the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION>, including possible links with Salvadoran-based terrorists, and discussions by <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> members of committing violent acts. The investigation was closed down without any charges being filed, and the bureau has now begun an investigation of its agents' conduct <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> has said it was investigated because it opposes President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Central America policies. Several members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> told <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> they remained skeptical of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> information that triggered the investigation in March 1983 and fueled it until it closed in June 1985. Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., the former district attorney of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said he has `` grave questions'' about <PERSON> Revell </PERSON>'s justifications, adding `` You have to proceed on the basis of tangible hard facts and evidence'' _ which he indicated were lacking in this <PERSON> Revell </PERSON>, noting this was a terrorism investigation, testily replied that if the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> always waited `` until there was tangible evidence, you would have been picking up the pieces of the bombs.'' Documents previously released in the probe show that <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and informants sent to spy on <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> collected so much information on peaceful protest activities that bureau headquarters was worried that the investigation had gone too far. The documents, released under the Freedom of Information Act, have shown that while the investigation was targeted at <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION>, the files eventually included information on hundreds of other individuals and groups, ranging from <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> nuns to union leaders who opposed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> policies. <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> said that more than a year after the investigation began, top <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials warned field offices about investigating legitimate political activity, beause they `` sensed'' the conduct of some agents was `` very close to the line.'' `` We may have seen some wavering over that line,'' he said, but maintained that the investigation was legitimate under the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s foreign intelligence and counter-intelligence guidelines He flatly denied that the administration ever tried to influence the investigation, commenting, `` There's been absolutely no contact by anyone in the administration concerning tasking, opening or closing of the investigation.'' In defending the probe, <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> testified that in addition to possible violence, <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> was involved in circulating forged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> documents and had strong ties to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> communist party. `` Some have insinuated that this investigation was politically motivated as many individuals associated with <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> were opposed to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policies in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> said. `` Nothing could be further from the truth. `` We did find indications that some <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> members were at least discussing and planning violence. Our investigtions uncovered one <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> member who was tasked to determine response times of emergency services in a major <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> city; another <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> member stated he had developed a system to shut down a public utility in a major midwestern city; as well as plans to violently disrupt the 1984 Republican convention.'' The bureau initiated the investigation under foreign intelligence and counter-intelligence guidelines, designed to protect the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> against crimes such as espionage and terrorism, in which foreign powers or groups are involved. These guidelines allow the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to focus more on politically oriented groups and their missions than on specific crimes that are planned or carried out. Because of this wider latitude, some lawmakers and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> warn that it is easy to cross the line and investigate free speech and peaceful assembly. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> said the investigation in this case `` was predicated on information received from several sources that certain leaders and key members of <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> were involved in covertly furnishing funds and materials to a foreign terrorist organization.'' The group was identified as the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>, the group fighting a war against the U.S.-backed government of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, chief legislative counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said the investigation should have started under the most strict guidelines, those for general criminal investigations. These investigations can only begin `` when facts or circumstances reasonably indicate that a federal crime has been, is being, or will be committed.'' If the crime has already been committed, the probe focuses on who committed the act and on securing evidence. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is given greater leeway for a domestic `` intelligence'' investigation, which can focus on groups in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> trying `` to further political or social goals through activities that involve criminal violence.'' The bureau did not place the <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> investigation under either the intelligence or general guidelines, but under the foreign intelligence and counter-intelligence rules that involve participation by foreign entities. These rules remain largely classified, but officials familiar with them say they provide the widest latitude among the different sets of guidelines. On July 26, 1984 _ some 16 months after the investigation began _ <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> headquarters sent 32 field offices a message that suggested some of them were going beyond the guidelines. `` Some offices have reported information recently regarding political statements and political lobbying by <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> affiliates,'' it said. `` Supervisors in recipient offices must carefully monitor this and related investigations and asset operations within your respective divisions to ensure appropriate direction, targeting and reporting.'' But messages from the field showed that bureaus were still confused. In August 1984 the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> office told headquarters, `` the field is still not sure of how much seemingly legitimate political activity can be monitored.''

<HEAD>Marijuana, Cocaine Traces Said Found In Amtrak Switchman</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Marijuana and small traces of cocaine and methamphetamine were detected in the system of an <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> switchman who fled his post after a Washington-to-Boston train derailment, officials said Tuesday. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Connor </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Aldan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, tested positive for marijuana in his blood and urine, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said after receiving results from the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toxicology </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION>. In addition, there was evidence of cocaine and methamphetamine in <PERSON> Connor </PERSON>'s urine, but the levels were so low that the <ORGANIZATION> FRA </ORGANIZATION> declined to even say they represented a `` positive'' finding under normal circumstances. <PERSON> Connor </PERSON>, who has since resigned, was on duty in a control tower when the train struck a work vehicle in <LOCATION> Chester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, injuring 25 people on the train. Officials said he left his post after realizing he had failed to take the train off a stretch of track undergoing maintenance. <PERSON> Connor </PERSON> did not submit to blood or urine tests until more than 72 hours after the accident. For that reason, the <ORGANIZATION> FRA </ORGANIZATION> said it instructed the laboratory to test the specimens to seek the `` smallest detectable amount,'' even if it fell below the normal reporting range. FRA Administrator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said the case illustrated the importance of urine and blood tests being conducted on members of train crews involved in major accidents. That program was struck down two weeks ago by the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is appealing. `` Under the provisions of the recent 9th Circuit decision, it is unlikely that we could have performed these tests. Neither we nor the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> would have the benefit of the information the tests were able to provide,'' <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Donato </PERSON>, <PERSON> Connor </PERSON>'s attorney, was said to be in a meeting and unavailable for comment Tuesday. Marijuana can remain in the system and be detected for as long as 30 days after use. Cocaine and amphetamines have much shorter detection ranges _ roughly two to five days and two to seven days, respectively. The tests found <PERSON> Connor </PERSON> had 89 nanograms per mililiter of marijuana in his urine. A nanogram is one billionth of a gram. It normally takes a finding of at least 20 nanograms per mililiter to confirm the presence of the drug. <ORGANIZATION> FRA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Loftus </PERSON> declined to interpret the findings, but said they will be considered in investigations of the accident by his agency and the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>. `` This does not determine what level may have been in his system at the time of the accident. It does not determine impairment. It does not determine cause,'' <PERSON> Loftus </PERSON> said. An assistant conductor on the <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> train also tested positive for marijuana, but he was not believed to have had played any role in the accident, the <ORGANIZATION> FRA </ORGANIZATION> said.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> voted after a spirited debate today to support the U.S.-Canada free trade agreement despite fears that some state industries could suffer. The vote was 30 to 5, with the governors of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> in the minority. The governors also adopted policies urging the federal government to take action on child care, including a `` modest'' commitment of funds to help poor working families. The fight against the resolution supporting the free trade agreement was led by <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, who charged that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> energy producers, fisheries, precious metal miners and others `` are left at a disadvantage.'' `` We can express our support for free trade without endorsing the agreement,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. He said it was premature and governors should wait until their next meeting in August to take a stand. But <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> replied, `` I do n't like the beer, you do n't like the energy, Governor <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, but how are we going to have some input'' in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ratification debate. An aide to the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> governor explained that some American brewers have licensees in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Heilemann </PERSON>'s does not and could be left at a disadvantage. But <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said it would be `` a terrible mistake'' to spurn the agreement. Illinois Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said that if the governors did not put aside `` partisanship and parochial fears for the greater good of the country'' on this issue, `` then I have to say my voice would be a little softer'' when he asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to lay aside politics in dealing with the deficit or welfare reform. The governors, who were concluding their three-day winter meeting, did add an amendment to their resolution offered by Gov. <PERSON> Garrey </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carruthers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> which said: `` The governors have significant concerns about issues created or not fully resolved by the agreement and ask to be consulted as the implementing legislation or other measures are developed to ameliorate these problems. The administration should enter into additional negotiations to address inequities regarding subsidies.'' The governors adopted a policy two years ago supporting the U.S.-Canada free trade negotiations. The new policy says the governors' support `` is contingent upon <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> doing nothing'' before the final treaty ratification to jeopardize or undermine `` the spirit and benefits of the free trade agreement.'' The governor of <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ada </PERSON>, expressed concern that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territories were left out of the initial agreement. The governors of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> abstained from the vote, which did not include all the state leaders, because of their concerns about the agreement, which was signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> on Jan. 2. The agreement, which must be ratified by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, would eliminate all tariffs between the two countries by 1999. It also would set up a new tribunal to settle future trade disputes. Forty-four governors signed a letter urging the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to pass a welfare reform bill this year and the governors also asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to extend through 1992 their right to issue mortgage revenue bonds. A provision in the 1986 tax reform law forbids their issuing new mortgage revenue bonds after 1988. On Monday the governors went to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to hear President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> make a pitch for a no-frills, $ 1.1 billion Republican alternative to the $ 4.3 billion House-passed version of welfare reform. He also cautioned them to `` tread carefully'' on the issue of child care. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, a Democratic presidential hopeful, called <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s speech a disappointment. He said the president should have joined the governors' call for passage of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>'s welfare reform bill in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> instead said he still strongly supports the less costly Republican alternative that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rejected two months ago, which would give states more flexibility in running their welfare programs. Unlike the Democratic bill passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, it would not provide any big increase in Aid to Families with Dependent Children. The governors' policy on child care calls for the public and private sectors to work in concert on the problem, and says that despite the deficit, `` the governors believe that the federal government should begin to take action to improve child care.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Disabled Americans express greater interest in politics than other citizens, but they register and vote at a rate considerably lower than the general public, says a survey released Tuesday. `` Our findings suggest that barriers, either external or internal or both, prevent many disabled Americans from converting their exceptionally high political interest into actual electoral activity,'' said <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, which conducted the poll. The telephone poll of 536 disabled people nationwide found that 53 percent said they follow government and public affairs most of the time. In comparison, only 26 percent of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> adults pay attention to politics much of the time, according to a 1984 National Election Study by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>. During the 1984 presidential campaign, 46 percent of the disabled Americans were `` very much interested'' in the contest compared with 35 percent of all adults, according to the new survey, conducted in June and July 1987 by <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> and Associates. However, the interest did not translate into equal levels of registration and voting, Disabled people registered at a rate that is six points lower than the general population and voted at a rate that 12 points lower, the poll said. The most common barrier cited for disabled people was lack of transportation and difficulty in getting to the polls, problems noted by 29 percent of the respondents. Twenty-one percent said it was difficult to stand or walk. The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said he expects the number of disabled voters to increase as states comply with federal law to make areas accessible to the nation's approximately 35 million disabled. The survey defined disabled as people with a health problem that prevented them from working, attending school or participating in other activities; people with a physical disability such as blindness, or people who considered themselves disabled. The announcement of the survey results coincided with the start of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disability </ORGANIZATION>'s public service campaign to encourage the disabled to register to vote. The campaign included magazine ads featuring photos of former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> and presidential press secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, and the words, `` We're Here Promoting Voter Registration for the 1988 Elections.'' The ad also carries a toll-free number for registration information: 1-800-248-ABLE. One-minute television spots also promote the hotline number.

<HEAD>Anniversary To Mark Annexation By Nazis Surrounded By Controversy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Leaders of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s three main political parties called Tuesday for a reconsideration of plans to have President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> address a ceremony on the 50th anniversary of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s annexation by <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The debate over the solemn ceremony March 11 is the latest round in the international controversy surrounding <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> and his role in the German army under <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>. Several high-ranking politicians have suggested the event should be called off, saying a <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> speech is not the way for the country to reflect on the atrocities of the Nazi era. None of the officials Tuesday called for a cancellation and none said that <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> should be barred from speaking. Still, it was clear that the politicians were not satisfied with the structure of the ceremony as it stands. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> has consistently denied that he committed wrongdoing as a first lieutenant serving in the German army in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION> in World War II. An international historians' commission report released earlier this month left open the question of whether <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> committed Nazi wartime atrocities. However, the report said <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was `` in close proximity'' to Nazi atrocities in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION>, knew they were going on and made no attempt ot stop them. It also said <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> concealed his wartime past. The commission, which started work in 1987, was formed after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government placed <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> on a `` watch list'' of undesirable aliens, effectively barring him from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. At a joint news conference Tuesday, the parliamentary leaders of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the Socialists and the rightist-oriented <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said organizers should rethink plans for the cermony which include a Waldheim speech. Parliament President <PERSON> Leopold </PERSON> <PERSON> Gratz </PERSON>, a Socialist, said it is not a question of canceling the ceremony. But he emphasized a meeting of the organizers is needed `` because high officials have gone public with their questioning of the sense of the planned official ceremony.'' Several thousand protesters are expected to gather outside the <LOCATION> Hofburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION>, where the ceremony is set to take place, to demonstrate against <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> and demand his resignation. Protesters, many of them opposed to <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, also have promised to flood Heroes' Square next to the <LOCATION> Hofburg </LOCATION> on March 12, the day after the scheduled <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> speech. <PERSON> Gerulf </PERSON> <PERSON> Stix </PERSON>, parliamentary leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, also called Tuesday for a rethinking of the commemoration plans, while the tiny Greens party has called for its scrapping altogether. Several other political leaders also have expressed their reservations. `` I have misgivings about this event,'' <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinowatz </PERSON> told reporters at a news conference Monday. The former chancellor called, instead, for reflection of `` what happened on March 11, 1938 and what must be done so that such a thing never happens again.'' German troops marched into <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> nearly 50 years ago, officially linking this Alpine nation with <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s Third Reich. Austrians are marking the annexation, called the Anschluss in German, as a time of reflection on the troubled past. Austrian television and radio, along with many of the country's newspapers, have started programs leading up to the March 11 commemoration date There also are films and exhibitions.

 Doctors, dentists and other health-care workers can face penalties under the city's civil rights laws if they refuse to treat people with AIDS, an administrative law judge has ruled.

<TEXT>
 Soviet President <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> was welcomed Tuesday by his Hungarian counterpart <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> at the beginning of a five-day visit to this reform-minded but economically stagnant Soviet ally. The only official business on the calendar of the former longtime <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> foreign minister, who became <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> president three years ago, was the signing of an agreement establishing a Hungarian cultural center in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. But a Hungarian official said privately that <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> and Hungarian leaders could be expected to discuss `` everything'' about relations between the two countries. The visit officially was to mark the 40th anniversary of the Feb. 18, 1948, mutual assistance pact between the two countries. And on Thursday, <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> is to give a major address to the Hungarian Parliament. <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, 78, was accompanied by a large <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> delegation, including Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Loginov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. The Soviets are staying until Saturday morning. In a brief but ornate welcoming ceremony in the square in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> building situated along the <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> inspected an honor guard of troops and listened to a military band play the anthems of the two nations. He and <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> then departed, presumably for private talks. Representatives of the Soviet delegation were to meet with reporters in the evening. The government newspaper in a banner headline across its front page Tuesday said, `` We greet with sincere respect and friendship Comrade <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>.'' The newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hirlap </ORGANIZATION>, noted that it was <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>'s first state trip abroad since assuming the presidency of the Supreme Soviet in 1985 after his long career as Soviet foreign minister. The reason he chose <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, the newspaper said, may be `` that our own efforts and initiatives are being recognized'' and that `` Soviet bodies are showing a well-meaning interest in our country.'' <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> under party chief <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> has been a leader of economic and political reform among Soviet bloc nations, and its policies in many ways parallel the changes advocated in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. But the economic success of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in the 1960s and'70s has given way to stagnation in the 1980s. Hungarians are facing double-digit inflation and a foreign debt burden of $ 16 billion for a country of only 10.6 million people, the highest per capita debt in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION>. The economic problems and the question mark hanging over the nation as it waits the eventual retirement of <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, who will be 76 in May, are seen as two possible topics that would come up during the <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> visit. <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> has been general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Party since 1956.

 `` The Red Sorghum Field'' _ an epic film about seduction and war in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ won the best-picture award Tuesday at the 38th Berlin Film Festival. The best-director prize went to Canadian <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jewison </PERSON> for his romantic comedy `` Moonstruck,'' and <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> was named best actress for her portrayal of an ambitious TV producer in `` Broadcast News.'' <PERSON> Joerg </PERSON> <PERSON> Pose </PERSON> and <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Moeck </PERSON> shared the best-actor honors for their work in the East German entry `` Bear Ye One Another's Burden. Twenty films from 15 countries competed for top prize at the festival, considered <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s second-most prestigious movie competition next to the <LOCATION> Cannes </LOCATION> film festival. `` The Red Sorghum Field,'' the first feature for director <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Yimou </PERSON>, is set in a remote province of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> during the late 1920s and early 1930s. It tells the story of a young married girl who is seduced by a distillery worker and bears his child.

<HEAD>Justices Reaffirm States' Power to Control Tidal Lands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in a defeat for private landowners, on Tuesday buttressed the power of states to control inland and coastal property affected by shifting tides. In a 5-3 ruling involving <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s claim to 42 acres of underwater land, the justices hotly disputed the effect of the decision. The dissenters said it threatens private property in every coastal state in the nation. But Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, writing for the majority, said, `` We are doubtful that this ruling will do more than confirm the prevailing understanding. Our ruling today will not upset titles in all coastal states.'' The ruling, involving oil - and gas-rich land near <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, said states own land beneath waters subject to the tide's influence _ and not only land under navigable The ebb and flow of the tide, not navigability, determines the state's ownership as long as it previously has not relinquished a public trust claim to the tidelands, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. `` States have interests in lands beneath tidal waters which have nothing to do with navigation,'' he said. Those purposes range from protecting fishing to setting aside submerged land for reclamation for urban expansion, he said. `` It would be odd to acknowledge such diverse uses of public trust tidelands and then suggest that the sole measure of the expanse of such lands is the navigability of the waters over them,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. He said Tuesday's ruling is in line with longstanding tradition giving states control over tidelands. The court rejected an appeal by private landowners and companies that included <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> and a partnership called <PERSON> Cinque </PERSON> <PERSON> Bambini </PERSON>. The private interests challenged <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s claim to some 2,400 acres of undeveloped property in <LOCATION> Hancock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Lower courts granted most of the land to the private companies. But the courts said the state owns 42 acres underlying the north branch of <PERSON> Bayou </PERSON> <PERSON> LaCroix </PERSON> and 11 small drainage systems, about five miles from the gulf. The state leased the land to <ORGANIZATION> Saga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in 1977 for oil and gas exploration. The <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 upheld the state's ownership of the land based on a grant from the federal government when <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> became a state in 1817 The state court said the state's title extends to all land subject to tidal influence, inland to the mean high water mark. The <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> land is influenced by the tide since it is affected by the ebb and flow of an adjacent navigable river that flows into the gulf. The private landowners and companies traced their claims to the underwater land back to <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> land grants of 1813. In a dissenting opinion Tuesday, Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said the ruling could have sweeping impact. `` The court holds today that the public trust includes not only tidewaters along the ocean shore, but also discrete bodies of water that are influenced by the tide but far removed from the ocean or any navigable tidal water,'' she said. `` Breaking a chain of title that reaches back more than 150 years, the court today announces a rule that will disrupt the settled expectations of landowners not only in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> but in every coastal state.'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> was joined by Justices <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>. In other decisions, the court: _ Limited the job protection for government workers fired for lacking security clearances In a 5-3 ruling involving a fired laborer at a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> installation in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, the court agreed with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration that the <ORGANIZATION> Merit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> lacks authority to decide whether denials of security clearance are justified. _ Said, 6-2 in a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> case, that a criminal suspect's rights are not violated when a witness who is unable to identify the suspect in court testifies about an earlier identification of the _ In a victory for the states of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, unanimously limited the authority of the <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> secretary to allocate water stored in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> reservoirs _ Unanimously ruled in a case from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> that businesses may not be sued in federal court for refusing to contribute to multi-employer union benefit funds after a collective bargaining agreement expires Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who joined the court last Thursday, did not take part in any of the decisions.

<TEXT>
 A 21-year-old white man `` taught to hate black people'' was sentenced Tuesday to perform 200 hours of community service for the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> after he admitted chasing two blacks with a baseball bat. <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Nudelman </PERSON> said he hoped that by working with blacks, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalafut </PERSON> would overcome his prejudice. `` He has been taught to hate black people for some reason,'' <PERSON> Nudelman </PERSON> said after the sentencing. `` I'm trying to put him in an environment where he can perhaps do some good and learn something about the people he thinks he hates and perhaps learn that his feelings are misguided.'' <PERSON> Kalafut </PERSON> was charged Aug. 16 after he and other whites brandishing baseball bats, throwing bottles and shouting racial slurs chased two blacks from a transit stop in <LOCATION> Gage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, a predominantly white neighborhood on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>. The plumbing company laborer could have been sentenced to a year in prison on his plea of guilty to aggravated assault and ethnic intimidation, the judge said. <PERSON> Kalafut </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON>, is serving a six-year prison term after pleading guilty to firebombing the home of a black family who had moved into <PERSON> Gage </PERSON> <PERSON> Park </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Silver </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON>' attorney. <PERSON> Silver </PERSON> said the order for his client to work for <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> is `` a good sentence given the fxhat he's basically pleaded guilty to hating a minority group.'' `` By being with black people, he will have a chance to learn they are no different than he is except that the color of their skin is different. I think that is an important lesson for anyone to learn, especially someone who has been involved in this kind of activity,'' <PERSON> Silver </PERSON> said. The attorney said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalafut </PERSON>, who declined to be interviewed, was willing to give the sentence a try but was `` concerned about his own personal safety when he is in the neighborhood of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>,'' located on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>. He also said <PERSON> Kalafut </PERSON> was concerned about being rejected by <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> officials and being `` made the scapegoat in a sort of reverse discrimination.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> plans to work hard to make sure that does n't happen, said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> McClellan </PERSON>, president of the group's South Side branch. `` Certainly we do n't presume there are only white racists or what have you,'' <PERSON> McClellan </PERSON> said. `` Racism can be engendered by anyone inclined to that sort of prejudice.'' He said it was n't the civil-rights group's job to punish <PERSON> Kalafut </PERSON>. He also said he was n't sure what type of work the group would ask him to perform. `` I can only hope his attitude is such that he's willing to come here and pay his debt to society,'' <PERSON> McClellan </PERSON> said. `` I would hope that he would have some positive reflections from this experience that maybe he's been hating the wrong thing.'' <PERSON> Nudelman </PERSON> said that trying to help <PERSON> Kalafut </PERSON> overcome his prejudice made more sense than sentencing him to jail, `` where he wo n't learn anything except more hatred.'' But the judge warned, `` If he screws up and does n't do what he's supposed to, he'll come back before me and I'll sentence him to jail.

 <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> took the gold for its coverage of the Winter Olympics, winning the week, moving into the lead in the February sweeps and taking over second place for the season, ahead of CBS. Olympics events took six places among the top 20 shows, forcing <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> into second place for the week ending Feb. 21 and for the sweeps, which help determine the rates local stations charge advertisers. The opening chapter of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s much-ballyhooed miniseries `` Noble House'' ended up 16th. However, it did beat out <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s Olympics coverage for Sunday night as well as the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> movie `` Bring Me the Head of <PERSON> Dobie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillis </PERSON>.'' Coverage of the Olympics in <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, gave <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> its first weekly victory since Super Bowl Week, ending Jan. 31. Its only other first place for the season was during the World Series, the week ending Oct. 25. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s coverage of the Tuesday night events were first in the ratings. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Cosby Show'' was second and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s Saturday coverage was third. Wednesday's coverage was seventh and Thursday's was ninth <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> won the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> ratings for the week with an average of 19.4. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> was second with 15.0 and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> was third with 12.8. The rating is the percentage of the nation's 88.6 million households with television. The new season-to-date ratings: <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> 16.3, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 13.8, CBS 13.6. The Top 10 shows were: <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s Tuesday Olympics, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Cosby Show,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s Saturday Olympics, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` A Different World,'' CBS' `` 60 Minutes,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Cheers,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s Wednesday Olympics, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Murder, She Wrote,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s Thursday Olympics, and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Family Ties'' and `` ALF,'' tied for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s evening news show, benefiting from the Olympics viewership, remained ahead of its rivals with a rating of 12.0. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> was second with 11.1 and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> third with 10.0. The lowest-rated network show was CBS' `` 48 Hours: Campaign Trail.'' Here are the five bottom shows in descending order: CBS' `` Houston Knights,'' CBS' `` Ringling Brothers Circus: 20th Anniversary of the Clown College,'' CBS' `` West 57th Street,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Decision: 88, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>,'' and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` 48 Hours: Campaign Trail. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was also enjoying good ratings for its Sunday night shows. `` 21 Jump Street'' had its highest rating to date with 6.6, which would place it ahead of three network shows. `` Married With Children'' got a 5.7 rating, its highest ever. That would place it higher than the two bottom network shows. `` Werewolf'' got its highest rating ever in its 8 o'clock time period, 5.1, which would give it a tie with the network's' lowest-rated show.

 <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Massoud </PERSON> said Tuesday that when soldiers took him to the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> beach near his home here, beat him and buried him in the sand, they told him: `` Do n't think you are going to return alive.'' The 18-year-old youth and a <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> lawyer want to take the army to court over the brutality <PERSON> Massoud </PERSON> says was inflicted on him. It is the second time this month Palestinians have reported being buried alive by soldiers. The Israeli army says it is investigating both incidents. `` They took me to the beach'' about a mile and a half away, <PERSON> Massoud </PERSON> said. `` They attached me to a jeep and dragged me behind it through the sand and the water.'' <PERSON> Massoud </PERSON> said he saw another youth on the beach, whom he identified as <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamad </PERSON>, receiving the same treatement. `` They put sand in my mouth and covered me with sand, then they covered me up, using their hands,'' he said. The youth said he did not know how deeply he was buried, but the weight on his chest was very heavy and he lost consciousness. `` The next thing I remember, I was in the hospital,'' he said. Lying under a blanket on a mattress spread on the floor of his spare home in the Khan Yunis refugee camp, the young Palestinian recounted how <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers burst into his home at 4 a.m. Feb. 14. `` They used ladders to climb over the wall'' into the tiny courtyard in front of the house, <PERSON> Massoud </PERSON> said. As family members and neighbors began to gather in the small room, he said: `` I was sleeping, here, like this. I suddenly saw soldiers. They shined a strong light in my face. They started to beat me with sticks.'' The youth said the soldiers put a chain around his neck to raise him to his feet, beat him to the ground and used the chain to raise him again. <PERSON> Aisha </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Massoud </PERSON>, 40, mother of <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> and nine other children, said the soldiers also entered her room. She said about 15 entered the one-story house. Ms. <PERSON> Massoud </PERSON> said soldiers also grabbed her 10-year-old son <PERSON> Sami </PERSON>, and one of them stuck a gun in <PERSON> Sami </PERSON>'s mouth. `` I grabbed for him, and they hit me here,'' she said, pointing to a fading mark on her forehead. She said neighbors told her later the soldiers had raided many houses in the neighborhood, a maze of winding, narrow alleys. They were looking for teen-aged boys, she said, but her son <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> was the only one in the area. After the soldiers took <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> to the beach, buried him in the sand and left, families living near the beach rescued him. `` Of course I'm angry,'' he said. `` This is no way to treat people. They told me on the road, on the way to the beach, ` Do n't think you are going to return alive.' On Feb. 5, soldiers grabbed four Palestinian youths and covered them up with a bulldozer in the village of <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, 40 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The army detained two soldiers in the case, but the investigation is continuing. <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaaban </PERSON> wants to press the case in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. `` I think we will have some problems because he and his family will be afraid,'' <PERSON> Shaaban </PERSON> said. `` The military police have threatened people in other cases.'' The medical report at <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON>' Nasser hospital indicate the youth was treated in the emergency room but suffered only bruises. X-rays showed no broken bones. A doctor, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Massoud </PERSON>'s family refused to allow him to be admitted for fear the army would come for him. `` We are n't going to court for justice,'' <PERSON> Shaaban </PERSON> said. `` We are going to court because we know all the newspapers will talk about it. That's useful. But we know we'll never get justice.'' The boy's father, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Massoud </PERSON>, said he too wants to push the case in the courts, but is afraid. `` If we go to court, the next day they will come and beat him,'' the father said. `` Maybe, after it is in the press, I'll discuss it with the lawyer. `` If it makes trouble for us, we wo n't do it.''

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Tuesday the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has made a `` very clear'' commitment to withdraw its troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, even though no firm timetable has been announced. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources said the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> had begun preparations to leave. Soviet soldiers were sent to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 and an estimated 115,000 are in the country helping the Communist government fight Moslem insurgents. <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> officials who attended a closed meeting with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> described him as hopeful of a Soviet withdrawal, but said he did not mention specific evidence that preparations were under way. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told reporters, when asked why he was optimistic about Soviet intentions: `` Their statements are very clear and very public and unequivocal, unadorned.'' A senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity, said Soviet troops are taking up defensive positions and dependents are being sent home. He said this was `` solid evidence'' that the Soviet military intervention would end soon. The official also said Soviet soldiers are not being replaced when they finish tours of duty. He spoke on <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s flight to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> from two days of talks in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. While <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact colleagues were briefed on the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> talks by <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, the Soviet foreign minister. After a 2 -LCB- - hour meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to prepare for a trip Wednesday to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, where he will meet with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders about efforts to revive peace negotiations In his remarks to reporters, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he had encountered `` intense skepticism'' about the chances of a breakthrough on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> negotiations, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has `` a few ideas'' that could help end the deadlock. He was not more specific. `` I believe that if there are chances, even if the chances are small, it's worthwhile trying,'' he said. `` You ca n't be too afraid of failing.'' Europeans who attended the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> meeting said the allies praised <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for making an effort on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace. `` There was the feeling expressed that of course the situation appears deadlocked, but that nonetheless it would be worth trying now,'' one said, on condition that his name not be given. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said a complete Soviet withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> would boost prospects for resolving other regional issues. `` I certainly have the sense ... that they do regard their presence in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> as counterproductive at this point and they would like to leave,'' he said. On Feb. 8, Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> offered to begin the withdrawal May 15 if <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> reach agreement by March 15 in U.N.-sponsored negotiations that resume in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> next week. He said the pullout could be accomplished in 10 months. <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> officials have accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of obstructing a settlement by insisting an interim government be created in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to prevent protracted civil strife. About 3.5 million Afghan refugees have fled to neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which is eager for a solution. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies the Soviets decided to withdraw because they realized they could not defeat the guerrillas, who get much of their support from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The secretary also reported progress on arms control in his <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> talks with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. On Monday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators were directed to prepare within a month three draft agreements for a treaty to reduce long-range, or strategic, nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 50 percent. Draft accords on verification, disposing of weapons and exchange of information are to be ready for the next Shultz-Shevardnadze meeting, March 22-23 in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The goal is for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to sign the final treaty at a summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> late this spring.

 Cities may not promote equal opportunity by imposing blanket restrictions that force private clubs to admit women and racial minorities as members, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was told Tuesday. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON>, a lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clubs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said such a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> law violates `` the fundamental right of our citizens ... to choose who their friends will be.'' But <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimroth </PERSON>, the city's chief lawyer, said the clubs affected by the law are not intimate associations but bastions of the `` old-boy'' network where business deals are consummated. Citing the example of the 10,003-member <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Zimroth </PERSON> asked the justices, `` Can you imagine someone saying ` Here are 10,002 of my most intimate friends.''' The court seemed to be confused by the widely varying views expressed by <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zimroth </PERSON> about the law and a ruling by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s highest state court upholding it. The justices' decision, expected by July, could carry an impact well beyond <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s borders. At least five other major cities _ <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> _ have enacted similar ordinances recently. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> law banning discrimination by public accommodations exempts `` distinctly private organizations.'' But it deprives non-religious groups of that designation if they have more than 400 members, provide regular meal service and regularly get their members' dues paid by non-members such as the members' employers. <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON> said the city law wrongly treats any organization that meets the three criteria as non-private. `` Three prongs and you're out,'' he said `` This law incorporates a fundamentally incorrect analysis of the freedom to associate.'' <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON> said each club affected by the law should have a chance to prove that, even if it meets each of the three criteria, it is a truly private entity. <PERSON> Zimroth </PERSON> said no such club has come forward. `` I do n't think this is a real case,'' he said. `` The city council was n't talking about hypothetical clubs. It was talking about real clubs.'' Both lawyers were interrupted repeatedly by questions from the bench during the 60-minute argument session. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who joined the court last Thursday and only recently resigned from a men-only, whites-only club in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, appeared troubled by the fact that the law also exempts certain `` benevolent orders'' such as the Masons, <ORGANIZATION> Loyal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moose </ORGANIZATION>, Protective Order of Elks and the Knights of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON> argued that treating various private organizations differently violates equal-protection guarantees. <PERSON> Zimroth </PERSON> said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> officials were not concerned about such organizations being used as extensions of the business office. Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, who recently resigned from a men-only club in the nation's capital, did not ask a question. One of the more animated exchanges occurred when Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> suggested that the challenged law was a valid civil rights measure and then said to <LOCATION> Mansfield </LOCATION>, `` You want to torpedo it.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> rejected <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> charges Tuesday it is building up forces for a nuclear attack and it demanded the communist nation admit it ordered the bombing of a civilian airliner. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> dismissed a North Korean demand that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> call off joint military exercises, called `` Team Spirit.'' It accused <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> of fomenting tension on the divided <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula and trying to sabotage the 1988 Olympic Games in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintains 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and heads the command, which represents the 16 nations that fought under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> auspices against <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> during the Korean War. `` Do n't miscalculate ... the will of the world to react, with appropriate action, to continued barbaric acts of terrorism which result in the deaths of innocent people,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rear Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pendley </PERSON>, the chief <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Command delegate. <PERSON> Pendley </PERSON> demanded <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> punish those involved in the bombing last November of a South Korean airliner and apologize to the world. All 115 people aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> jet were killed when it blew up Nov. 29 over the <LOCATION> Andaman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. Chief North Korean delegate Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> had nothing to do with the attack and charged <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> with destroying the plane in a scheme to retain power and discredit the north. The charges were made at the first meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armistice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> since the loss of the plane. The commission polices the ceasefire that ended the Korean War between north and south in 1953. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> called the meeting to demand the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> abandon the annual `` Team Spirit'' exercises that start next month, charging the exercises were preparations for an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nuclear attack. `` You have nuclear war plans worked out,'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> charged. <PERSON> Pendley </PERSON> dismissed the North Korean accusations and said the exercises were lawful military activities intended to guarantee the safety of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>'s delegation presented a videotape of a televised confession last month in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hui </PERSON>, a woman who claimed she was a North Korean agent and destroyed the plane to disrupt the Olympic Games that start in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> in September. Ms. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, who rode an early leg of the <ORGANIZATION> KAL </ORGANIZATION> flight, took poison along with a male companion when they were detained in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>. The man died but she recovered. <PERSON> Pendley </PERSON> said the confession was damning evidence that the north could not refute. `` You thought you had committed the perfect crime, but, like all criminals, you made a mistake,'' he said. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has been demanding to be a co-host of the Olympic Games. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have rejected the demand.

 While hundreds of <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> students discussed racism in class, a small group at neighboring <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday occupied a dormitory office to protest racial attitudes at that elite school. The takeover came nearly a week after the end of a six-day occupation of a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> building by more than 100 people protesting racial violence on campus. That occupation ended when protesters reached an agreement with the chancellor, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON>, which included increased hiring of minority faculty and staff. <PERSON> Penny </PERSON> <PERSON> Premdas </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> group, <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Underrepresented </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cultures </ORGANIZATION>, said up to 40 students occupied the office of the <ORGANIZATION> Dakin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> dormitory, a traditional meeting place for minority students, at 8 a.m. to work on a list of demands, including that an office in the dormitory be converted into a Third World cultural center. `` We have been to the administration several times over the past three years with our demands and concerns and nothing has been done,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Premdas </PERSON>, who is black. `` It's been all lip service. It seemed this was the only way to get something done.'' Unlike the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION>, which has been the scene of attacks on blacks, `` We have never had any blatant physical harassment here,'' Ms. <PERSON> Premdas </PERSON> said. `` It has all been emotional and mental and institutional.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Dakin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> resident, <PERSON> Marston </PERSON> <PERSON> Chickering </PERSON>, said the occupation was `` particularly hard at this school, which has an image of being politically correct and aware.'' `` No one's ever satisfied at this school,'' said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagninm </PERSON>, a freshman from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> who lives across the yard from <LOCATION> Dakin </LOCATION>. `` Everyone's always feeling belittled or discriminated against. If it's not minorities, it's females ... this is what they -LRB- the protesters -RRB- feel they have to do to get attention.'' About 100 of the 1,100 undergraduate students at the private college are minorities, said <PERSON> Petez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gluckler </PERSON>, a spokesman for the administration. A consultant hired by the school last year to investigate racial attitudes on campus is preparing his final report, <PERSON> Gluckler </PERSON> said. The school planned to provide the protesters with food and sleeping bags, said <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Wicks </PERSON>. Hundreds of students at the 25,000-student <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> campus across town from <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> attended class discussions on racism on Tuesday. At least 35 classes were devoted to the topic in response to a call by the <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to boycott all classes Tuesday and Wednesday in lieu of forums on racism, said school spokeswoman <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> had warned in a statement against students boycotting classes and had suggested that racism discussions be held in classes.

He has a great love and respect for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and he knows how to get things done.'' The spokesman said <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s resignation had caught the administration by surprise, but that <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> was easily recognized as a top candidate for the job due to naval, congressional and White House experience. `` He's a known quantity. Everyone instantly recognized him as the perfect choice,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The spokesman said <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> earned <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>'s respect in the wake of the Iran-Contra affair, when the legislative liaison helped the former national security adviser forge a new relationship with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and its intelligence oversight committees. Ball also worked with <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> on the formulation of the latest budget policies, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` He earned <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s respect. ...

Prior to working in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> was assistant secretary of state for legislative and intergovernmental affairs. In 1981, he served as the chief clerk of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier, he had worked as the administrative assistant for former Sens. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Talmadge </PERSON>, D-Ga., and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION> Ball was commissioned as a regular officer in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in 1969 and served three years aboard the guided missile destroyer USS Sellers, followed by three years of service in the Department of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Producers Award $2,500 Settlement To People's Court Loser</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 `` People's Court'' Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Wapner </PERSON>'s word is the law on television, but not necessarily off camera, where the popular show's lawyers have agreed to pay a $ 2,500 settlement to a man the judge ruled against. The show's producers said the $ 2,500, awarded to 72-year-old former Mr. <PERSON> America </PERSON> <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravelle </PERSON>, marked the first time the judge has settled out of court with someone who has sued over a TV decision. `` The judge's decision was so bad it was unbelievable,'' said <PERSON> Ravelle </PERSON>, who had sought $ 2,000 in back rent and return of a bedroom set he said was taken by a woman he evicted from his house. <PERSON> Ravelle </PERSON> said in a recent interview that he was set up to look like a bully and a buffoon and then <PERSON> Wapner </PERSON> ruled against him for dramatic effect when the show was taped Dec. 4, 1985. `` I was instructed to project my voice and assert myself, while the defendant was submissive and scarcely audible,'' <PERSON> Ravelle </PERSON> said. `` This obvious ploy clearly established me as the big, macho villain.'' <PERSON> Wapner </PERSON> said he could n't recall <PERSON> Ravelle </PERSON>'s case and was unaware of the settlement, but added he tries to be fair to all people on the show. `` I try to be fair, and our track record is there,'' said <PERSON> Wapner </PERSON>, former presiding judge of <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` I try to make sure that each side gets a fair shot.'' <PERSON> Ravelle </PERSON>, who had sued the show for $ 1 million, agreed to drop the suit in exchange for the settlement last week. Of approximately 2,000 small claims cases <PERSON> Wapner </PERSON> has heard during the show's seven years, <PERSON> Ravelle </PERSON> is one of only three disgruntled litigants to sue, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON>, vice president for <ORGANIZATION> Ralph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION>, the show's producer. He is the only one to win a settlement, <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> added. Participants on `` People's Court'' are selected from among those who file for damages in small claims courts in 36 Southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> localities.

<HEAD>Prison Officials Say Inmates Cannot Inseminate Others</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The executive staff of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> has decided federal inmates should not have the privilege of begetting children through artificial insemination. If such a police were allowed, the government believes `` that numerous other inmates from regular prison institutions of all security levels would desire to beget children,'' according to the government's response filed Monday in the case of a federal prisoner. The response was filed Monday in the case of <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON>, 31, a prisoner in the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisoners </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> had filed a lawsuit against the government and received a favorable ruling from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> James </PERSON> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The judge recommended in November that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Collison </PERSON> rule that the bureau's lack of a policy on artificial insemination is n't a constitutionally sufficient reason to prohibit the procedure. <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> had asked in his lawsuit that doctors be allowed to collect his sperm at the prison so it could be frozen and sent to his wife's doctor in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. The executive staff of the bureau met earlier this month to consider a policy on the issue, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said in the government's response. If the procedure were allowed in one case, all 48 federal prisons would be affected. The prisons either would have to develop collecting, handling and storage procedures for semen, or private medical personnel would have to be allowed into the institutions, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. As result, the response said, the bureau believes the situation could be extremely costly or create substantial security risks. The government disagreed with <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s ruling that begetting or bearing children is a fundamental right that survives incarceration. Actually, begetting or bearing children is one of the many rights that is restricted by imprisonment, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> is serving a 14-year sentence on a charge of conspiracy to distribute cocaine.

<HEAD>Judge Holds 33 Firefighters In Contempt For Sickout</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Eighty-seven firefighters who had been on duty for more than three days were sent home Tuesday as colleagues ended a sickout and returned to work under threats of contempt of court citations. More than 100 firefighters called in sick Saturday, Sunday and Monday, despite a judge's order Saturday that they report for duty. Thirty-three firefighters who defied the order were held in contempt Tuesday by another judge, <PERSON> Americo </PERSON> <PERSON> Campanella </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, for failure to show up in court to explain why they were absent. The firefighters had been served notice by the city to appear in court on Monday. <PERSON> Campanella </PERSON>'s ruling stunned attorneys for Local 799 of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firefighters </ORGANIZATION>. They told <PERSON> Campanella </PERSON> it was their impression he only wanted union president <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and secretary-treasurer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kless </PERSON> in court. Attorney <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoopis </PERSON> said he thought his representation of the union membership as a whole, as well as <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s, was good enough to constitute the presence of the absent members. <PERSON> Campanella </PERSON>, who continued the hearing on the status of the rest of the firefighters who called in sick, said he would decide later what penalty to assess against the 33. Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paolino </PERSON> urged that no jail time be imposed. However, the city continued to press for contempt citations, even though the sickout ended with the start of Tuesday's day shift, to prevent something similar from happening in the future, according to city labor attorney <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Ragosta </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. The sickout, which the city is trying to prove is an illegal job action by municipal employees, cost the city about $ 84,000 in overtime and related expenses, estimated Fire Chief <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moise </PERSON>. It also meant a long haul for firefighters who went to work at 6 p.m. Friday. <PERSON> Moise </PERSON> kept them on duty through the sickout, but they went home Tuesday. The sickout apparently stemmed from a dispute over language in a contract ratified by firefighters in December but yet to be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> contends the city is trying to renege on a provision that calls for an officer to be placed in charge of each rescue unit. Union members also say the city is not replacing worn-out or damaged equipment as promised.

<TEXT>
 Then-FBI Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> was kept unaware of problems with a probe of anti-Reagan activists, even when it became clear that some agents were investigating legitimate protest activities, a top agency official said Tuesday. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Revell </PERSON>, executive assistant <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> director, also told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that no one in the administration told the bureau to conduct the investigation. <PERSON> Revell </PERSON>'s testimony offered the first in-depth look at the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s investigations of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in Solidarity with the People of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION>, which began in 1981 and ended in 1985 Leaders of <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> maintain that the inquiries were politically motivated, but <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> denied that charge. `` Nothing could be further from the truth,'' he said. `` We have investigated a number of groups on the other side of the political spectrum. ... `` The focus of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigations has been and is criminality, or the collection of intelligence which will keep our nation and citizens safe from terrorism,'' he said. At another point, <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> said, `` I have no knowledge of any political taskings by anyone in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> investigation.'' No criminal charges ever have been filed against <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> or any of its members. Several members of the committee told <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> they remained skeptical of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> information that triggered the investigation of <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., said he had `` grave questions'' about <PERSON> Revell </PERSON>'s justifications, adding, `` You have to proceed on the basis of tangible hard facts and evidence'' _ which he indicated were lacking in this case But <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> noted that it was a terrorism investigation, and added that if the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> always waited `` until there was tangible evidence, you would have been picking up the pieces of the bombs.'' Earlier, <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> the extent of <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>'s involvement in the <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> probe `` He was aware of several cables sent to him for informational purposes,'' <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> said. `` He did not authorize any of the activities. The supervision was at the sectional level.'' <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> added that it is impossible for the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> director to keep up with all the investigations the bureau conducts. However, he did say that in the wake of revelations about the conduct of the CISPES case, `` we have taken interim steps to increase the level of review'' of sensitive probes. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, who now directs the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, has had no public comment on the investigation. Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, vice chairman of the intelligence panel, joined <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> in criticizing the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> probe. `` It is apparent that whatever the rationale for its initiation, it resulted in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> subjecting many Americans and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> organizations to various types of scrutiny without any basis other than the exercise of their First Amendment rights,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. He later asked <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> why the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> headquarters had to send a memo on July 26, 1984, cautioning the field offices against reporting legitimate political activities by <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> replied that the memo was sent because top <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials `` sensed'' the conduct of some agents was `` very close to the line.'' `` We may have seen some wavering over that line,'' he said, but he maintained that the investigation was legitimate under the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s foreign intelligence and counterintelligence guidelines <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> opened its investigation into <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 3, 1981, after the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> requested the bureau examine whether the group was supplying money and material to leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and therefore was required to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> described that probe as `` just a records check,'' and it was closed in February 1982. A little more than a year later, on March 30, 1983, the counterterrorism section at the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> authorized a new investigation of <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION>. This probe, <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> said, was into whether members of <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> were `` engaged in international terrorism, activities in preparation therefor, or knowingly aiding and abetting the terrorists in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and other countries in the conduct of international terrorist activities.'' That investigation continued for more than two years, during which time, <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> said, `` we did find indications that some <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> members were at least discussing and planning violence.'' He cited an instance of a <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> member given the job of determining response times of emergency services in a major <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> city, another of a <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> member saying he had developed a system to shut down a public utility in a major Midwestern city and a third of discussion of plans to disrupt the 1984 Republican Convention in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanbrano </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION>, who attended the <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hearing, denied afterward that any of the charges were true. She suggested that the comments about possible violent activities might have been made by someone `` planted'' at <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> meetings. <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> closed the investigation in June 1985 `` when we found there was insufficient evidence to continue the investigation.'' He said `` part of the reason for that was the disinformation and misinformation supplied to us'' by <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Varelli </PERSON>, who told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee last year hat he was paid by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to infiltrate the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> chapter of <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> and told the bureau what it wanted to hear. <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> said earlier that the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent who directed <PERSON> Varelli </PERSON> was investigated for `` mishandling documents, funds and direction.'' <PERSON> Varelli </PERSON> has sued the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in an attempt to get pay he claims he is owed for his work.

<HEAD>Orders To Factories Fell 2.8 Percent In January</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for `` big ticket'' durable goods fell 2.8 percent in January, the biggest decline in a year, reflecting sharp drops in demand for aircraft and primary metals, the government reported Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that orders for durable goods fell to a seasonally adjusted $ 112.23 billion last month, a drop of $ 3.28 billion from December. The steep decline, only the third setback in the past 13 months, followed a big December advance of 4.1 percent, the strongest rise since March. Analysts said the January setback reflected a return to more normal levels of demand in both aircraft and primary metals, two categories which had seen unusually big advances in December. Both the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> noted that the overall decline also masked pockets of strength, particularly in non-defense capital goods. `` The numbers that were released on durable goods, if one subtracts some of the temporary fluctuations, were really quite strong,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said during an appearance before a House Banking subcommittee. Many economists are predicting that growth will slow in the first half of 1988 because of an unusually high buildup of unsold inventories which occurred at the end of 1987. But <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said he did not think this slowdown would deteriorate into a recession, in part because of the strength being shown in manufacturing. `` While we envisage sluggish growth for the period immediately ahead, there just are very few signs that we're about to tilt over'' into a recession, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that the administration continues to believe that the trend in manufacturing `` is still healthy.'' The administration is forecasting that half of overall growth this year will come from rising factory production. Private economists said they were not alarmed by the January setback, which was the biggest drop since an 8 percent fall in January 1987. They pointed to a 1.6 percent increase in orders for non-defense capital goods, the category which reflects business plans to expand production facilities. `` That is an encouraging sign that businessmen are not backing off from their investment plans,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. Even with the setback last month, new orders were still 15.5 percent ahead of a year ago, reflecting the strong export demand caused by the decline in the value of the dollar. Demand in transportation industries fell by 12.4 percent to $ 27.21 billion last month following an 8.6 percent advance in December, a surge which was attributed primarily to new aircraft orders placed with the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. Orders for primary metals fell 15.5 percent to $ 10.19 billion after having shot up 10.5 percent in December. Analysts said that the big December jump in orders came because of fears of pending price increases. Demand for military hardware fell 12.1 percent in January to $ 7.86 billion. Orders for electrical machinery rose 5.5 percent in January while demand for non-electrical machinery rose 5.8 percent. Shipments of durable goods fell 3.3 percent to $ 109.26 billion following a 4.3 percent increase in December.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s parliament on Tuesday elected Irish-born <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> to a second five-year term as the country's president Eighty-two members of the 120-member <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>, or parliament, voted to re-elect <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON>, who was unopposed. Two voted against him and 18 did not vote, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. Other members were not present. The office of president is a largely ceremonial one in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the president has no formal party affiliation. `` I heartily thank the members of Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION> for their trust and their vote and -LRB- I -RRB- accept the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>'s decision with appreciation and gratitude,'' he said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. `` I am proud to serve the people.'' <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON>, 69, was first elected to the post in March 1983. His first term in office was marked by a controversial decision to pardon <PERSON> Shin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bet </PERSON> security agents, including the former head of the service, <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Shalom </PERSON>, who were found guilty of lying in court about the beating deaths of two captured Palestinian hijackers. <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> was criticized for the decision, but won praise when he took a strong moral stand against a ring of Jewish terrorists jailed for crimes against Arabs. He rejected a call from right-wing Israelis to pardon all of them, although he did lessen the sentences of some. <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> was also praised for his behind-the-scenes efforts to end an election stalemate in September 1984 between <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' centrist <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s conservative <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc His efforts contributed to the forming of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s unusual coalition government. <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> headed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s military intelligence from 1959 to 1962. In 1967, he became the first military governor of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, captured by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in that year's <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war.

 A British soldier sentenced to life in prison for slaying a <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> Catholic has been released from jail and returned to his regiment after only three years in prison, the army said Tuesday. Pvt. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thain </PERSON> was not, however, returned to active service in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. An army statement Tuesday said <PERSON> Thain </PERSON> killed the man when he was 18. `` While the army in no way condones his action, we consider the incident to have been a tragic error of judgment made by a young man in very difficult circumstances,'' the statement said. The Rev. <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Faul </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic priest and human rights campaigner in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, said he had no objection to the release, but asked why similar clemency could not be shown to civilians serving life sentences for actions committed in their youth. <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the legal political wing of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, claimed <PERSON> Thain </PERSON>'s release showed there was no justice in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. `` I'm very, very shocked and distressed. I ca n't believe this has happened,'' said the victim's father, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>. The announcement of <PERSON> Thain </PERSON>'s release came amid new tension between <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. On Sunday, a Catholic was killed by a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> soldier in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The Irish government announced it would undertake its own investigation of the slaying, even though the incident occurred in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>'s jurisdiction. The Irish move was seen as a calculated slight to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, since its police force has already announced its own inquiry and the soldier has been placed in military custody. Sunday's shooting of 23-year-old <PERSON> Aidan </PERSON> <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON> occurred near <LOCATION> Aughnacloy </LOCATION>, half a mile from the frontier in <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tyrone </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON> was killed by a bullet from an army observation tower at a checkpoint as he walked to a football match. <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON> was a <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> supporter, and his former parish priest said he was harassed whenever he passed through the checkpoint. Press Association, the British news agency, said the soldier who fired at <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON> told his interrogators it was an accident. <PERSON> Thain </PERSON> was convicted of killing <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, road manager of the pop group <LOCATION> Bananarama </LOCATION>, on Aug. 9, 1983. He claimed in court that he fired because he believed <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> was about to pull a gun on him. The judge found <PERSON> Thain </PERSON> `` deliberately untruthful.'' The private was the first soldier sentenced to life imprisonment for actions in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thain </PERSON> was released on a life license, a form of parole whereby he can be reimprisoned `` should his behavior give rise to concern,'' the Home Office said. It said he was freed after a review by the state parole board. Anglo-Irish relations are already under strain on a series of issues including disputes over the extradition of <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> suspects and British anti-terrorism laws which <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> sees as discriminatory toward Ulster Catholics. The worst tension, however, is being generated by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s announcement last month that it will not prosecute <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> police officers involved in the shooting of six unarmed Catholics in three incidents in 1982, despite evidence of a police conspiracy to pervert the course of justice

<TEXT>
 A memo to Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> from his friend <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> broached a proposal to bolster <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s moderate <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> against the rival <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc. In his September 1985 memo, made public Monday, <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> stressed the need to encourage Soviet leaders to allow greater Jewish emigration to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> because Russian Jews, once they are voters in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, tend to support the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> contends that 400,000 Jews want to emigrate from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ enough to make a difference in an Israeli election, if all were allowed to resettle in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s idea was based on the assumption that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would call early elections no later than March 1986, but it is unclear whether an influx of Russian Jews could have brought about a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> victory. No election was held, and in October 1986, then-Prime Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> switched jobs with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> in a power-sharing arrangement. `` There is a need to provide <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> with a increasing flow of Ashkenazi Jews to help balance the influx of Sephardic-Oriental Jews who have a natural affinity and affiliation with <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> wrote. `` From the standpoint of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> interests, the advantage is evident,'' he added without elaboration. Ashkenazi Jews are those whose origins are in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, while Sephardic Jews came from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Voter breakdown shows that Sephardim, who constitute some 60 percent of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 3.5 million Jewish population, tend to support <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> more than they do Labor. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leaders in the past have said privately they feel more comfortable with <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, which exhibits greater willingness to cede lands to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> neighbors in return for a peace settlement. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> is more hardline, refusing any territorial concessions. But publicly, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has consistently veered away from taking any stand that could be viewed as interference in internal <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> politics. The Wallach-Meese memo is the focal point of a criminal investigation of the attorney general. At issue is whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> knew, from reading the memo, of a plan to pay a bribe to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and, if so, why he did nothing about it. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> wrote that his business associate, Israeli-born oilman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>, had commissioned several public opinion polls that indicated a `` high probability'' of early elections and growing support for Labor. <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>, who resides in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and is a generous contributor to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, confirmed an arrangement with <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would receive some $ 700 million over 10 years from the pipeline that would pass near the Israeli border on its way from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Aqaba </LOCATION>. `` What was also indicated to me ... is that a portion of those fund will go directly to Labor,'' <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> wrote. The emigration issue, as outlined by <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, revolves around Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s promise to <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> to consider increasing emigration levels if the Jews went directly to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> rather than to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has refused to take any stand in support of direct Soviet emigration to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, saying it was up to the Jews to decide where they want to live.

 Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> sought the approval of the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday for an experiment to provide sterile needles to drug addicts in an effort to curb the spread of AIDS. Drug-users would make periodic visits to facilities yet to be established for the program and would get up to seven marked needles each time, depending on how many they returned from the previous visit. When entering the program, addicts would be offered a place, if available, at a drug treatment center. Rejected offers would be renewed periodically. `` No one initiative to contain the virus can be the answer, other than finding a vaccine or a cure for the disease itself,'' said <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, in a prepared statement at a closed morning meeting attended by city councilors. Conventional anti-drug measures `` do not go far enough in the short term'' to curb the spread of AIDS, he said. Addicts, their sex partners and their babies `` are the fastest growing group of AIDS victims,'' <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said. Among the 1,230 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> AIDS cases reported so far, about 20 percent have involved intravenous drug users. More than 25 percent of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s estimated 14,000 intravenous drug addicts are thought to be infected with the virus already, state officials said. Council President <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Iannella </PERSON> is expected to assign the measure to a council committee for review at the council meeting Wednesday, according to <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> also is seeking <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s approval of a petition to the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to by-pass state laws against possession of hypodermic syringes by drug addicts or against dispensing such equipment to drug addicts. Reaction was mixed among city councilors. Some like Councilor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Scondras </PERSON>, said after the meeting Tuesday that he backed the plan because `` my instincts tell me this is a medical crisis and -LRB- politicians -RRB- should not stand in the way of what a doctor prescribes for a patient.'' Councilor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said he has `` strong objections.'' `` First, I do n't think the city should be giving the appearance that we're condoning drug use, which we clearly are,'' said <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>. `` Second, I do n't think it'll work.'' Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has opposed any needle exchange program and so does state <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Prothrow-Stith </PERSON>. `` I do n't think we ought to be encouraging people to shoot up with heroin. I am against it,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told a news conference Tuesday. `` If we can get people into methadone maintenance programs, needles cease to be a factor. And that is a much, much better to deal with this, in addition to treatment.'' Last month, the state of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> announced a plan to distribute free needles to drug addicts in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome, which has no known cure, has been found to be spread through sharing of infected intravenous needles as well as through sexual contact.

 The active-duty strength of the nation's military services in January was virtually unchanged from the previous month but more than 12,000 below the same period last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday As of Jan. 31, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> had 2,167,378 men and women on active duty, up 767 from Dec. 31 figure. That combined total represents a decrease of 12,023, however, compared with the Jan. 31, 1987, tally. The armed services reported active-duty strength of 2,179,401 a year ago. It is not unusual for military strength to swing up and down on a monthly basis during the year, primarily because of differences in the flow of new recruits. The strength totals are expected to vary even more widely than normal this year, though, because the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> is reducing its active-duty strength in a budget-cutting move. According to the latest `` Military Strength'' assessment, two of the four armed services reported declines in personnel in January from December.

<HEAD>Poland Accuses West Of Stealing Its Young Professionals</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Western nations are luring away tens of thousands of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s most skilled professionals, causing a costly `` brain drain'' of its best and brightest young people, the government charged Tuesday. Government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said the West is cashing in on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s costly investment in education and threatening to prolong his country's economic crisis. He said more than 500,000 Poles emigrated to the West between 1983 and 1987, including nearly 60,000 university graduates. The losses include 19,000 engineers, 5,500 physicians, 4,800 economists and 4,000 scientists. `` There is a brain drain in the Western emigration policy'' that makes it difficult for unskilled workers to remain abroad but which `` eagerly retains experts in demanded specialties,'' Urban said. `` The rich West, which is criticizing socialism, is sucking from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> a part of socialism's achievement,'' he said. `` We are suffering these losses in favor of countries which in general ... are very reluctant to undertake economic cooperation with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> which would back our reforms.''. The educations of the doctors and engineers who have fled the country between 1983 and 1987 is about $ 100 million, Urban said. Urban's comments, read from a text at the beginning of his weekly news conference, mirrored charges made in November by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. In an interview with NBC News, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> replied to a question on the Soviet policy toward Jewish emigration by saying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are trying to solve their problems by `` organizing a brain drain from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' Urban did not specify what steps the government might take to stem the wave of emigration, saying he was only appealing to all Poles to express their views on a problem `` for which there is no simple remedy.'' Urban did say that Western countries should take the consequences of the brain drain into consideration `` in balancing mutal economic relations and commitments,'' an apparent reference to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s efforts to obtain new economic credits and a favorable debt payment rescheduling from its Western creditors. Urban's remarks reflect growing concern in the country to the large numbers of young professionals fleeing the country's economic crisis for greener pastures in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, among other countries. Last month, a joint government and <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> commission expressed concern about what it called an `` alarming phenomenon'' and called for measures to convince young Poles that they can satisfy their aspirations in their native country. Official newspapers have printed articles about emigration, including letters from young professionals explaining why they want to leave. Government polls have shown that more than half <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s youth would like to stay in the West to work for two years or more Emigration has grown since the lifting of martial law in 1983, when the government liberalized regulations for obtaining a passport to travel abroad. Urban said Poles made 4.2 million trips to Western countries from 1983-87. He said those staying abroad were motivated by economic rather than political reasons, describing their attitude as `` mean-spirited ... turning the back on the homeland instead of working in favor of improving living conditions.'' But he added the government did not intend to withdraw from its liberalized passport policy. Some Soviet bloc countries, such as <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, have demanded that would-be emigres repay the cost of their education before departing. From 1983 to 1987, Urban said, 58,500 people emigrated legally from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, including 5,000 university graduates. Another 117,000 people, including 16,500 university graduates, traveled to the West on business or tourist trips and then stayed permanently abroad without consent of Polish authorities. He said 328,000 people, including 38,000 with university degrees, extended their stay abroad, although many were expected to return to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, he said.

 State prosecutors said Monday they wo n't seek criminal charges against contractors of an apartment building that collapsed during construction in <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION> last year, killing 28 workers. Chief State's Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Bridgeport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Browne </PERSON> said investigators determined that the cause of the collapse `` did not involve intentional criminal conduct on the part of any contractor involved in the construction. `` While investigators have disclosed the most probable cause of the building collapse, we do not believe that they have demonstrated either a gross deviation from a reasonable person's standard of conduct or that the prosecution could demonstrate responsibility for criminally negligent homicide beyond a reasonable doubt,'' the prosecutors said in a statement <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieder </PERSON>, an attorney representing families of some collapse victims, said authorities probably do n't know all there is to know about the accident because some people with information may not have come forward. `` My experience is that more of them with information will begin singing like canaries as the pressures -LRB- of lawsuits -RRB- mount,'' he said. `` I think there's more behind this story,'' echoed <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Petta </PERSON>, general manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Waterbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which was a concrete subcontractor for the L'Ambiance project and lost 11 workers in the accident `` Who knows what will happen after all of the court proceedings?'' L'Ambiance Plaza, a multi-story apartment complex in <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>'s downtown, was being built in the lift-slab method. In that method, huge concrete floor slabs are poured and allowed to harden in a stack on the ground before they are jacked into place on steel columns. Federal authorities concluded the April 23, 1987, collapse was triggered when a small bracket that was part of the lifting system bent under pressure. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> concluded that builders failed to conduct stress-analysis tests to find out if the lifting brackets, steel pieces measuring about 4 by 12 inches, could hold up the concrete slabs. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> assessed a record $ 5.1 million in fines against five companies for violations at the apartment complex. The heaviest fines went to TPMI-Maycomber, a joint venture of <ORGANIZATION> TPM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Darien </ORGANIZATION> and B.H. Maycomber of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, which was the primary contractor and project manager, and <ORGANIZATION> Texstar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contruction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The decision announced Monday by <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> and <PERSON> Browne </PERSON> affects only state prosecution. A regional administrator for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Miles </PERSON>, said recently he has recommended federal criminal charges be filed as a result of the collapse. The federal review process could take months. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Egan </PERSON>, business agent for <ORGANIZATION> Ironworkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 424 </ORGANIZATION>, which lost seven men in the collapse, said he could n't understand the state prosecutors' decision. `` If there has to be criminal intent, than most manslaughter cases would have to be thrown out of court,'' <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bucci </PERSON> declined to comment on Monday's announcement except to say, `` They -LRB- <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> and <PERSON> Browne </PERSON> -RRB- are both excellent prosecutors and I'm not going to second guess their decision in this matter. In a lawsuit filed Oct. 28 by the victims' families, the city was accused of negligence in issuing a building permit for L'Ambiance Plaza and in inspecting construction of the building. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Turlington </PERSON>, a lawyer for <ORGANIZATION> Texstar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>'s decision verifies `` that ... the cause of the disaster has not been determined and <PERSON> Texstar </PERSON> continues to dispute the findings by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>.''

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet diplomats will have a tough time meeting a one-month deadline for drafting portions of a treaty to slash superpower nuclear arsenals, government and private experts said Tuesday. `` The aspects of the agreements that they have agreed to draft within 30 days are important, but they are appendages to the main treaty,'' said <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnesdale </PERSON>, a former arms control negotiator now at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. And another former negotiator, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackett </PERSON> of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, cautioned that `` the best way to get a bad agreement is to give your negotiators a deadline. Thirty days is an incredibly short time for an agreement that should take years to negotiate.'' Both the Soviets and Americans would have to make major changes in their bargaining positions to produce an agreement before a summit planned for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in late May or early June, said <PERSON> Carnesdale </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hackett </PERSON> and administration sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and his Soviet counterpart <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> set the 30-day deadline at their meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Monday, directing their staffs to reach draft agreements dealing with verifying compliance with the cutbacks, disposing the weapons, and exchange of information. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> meet again in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on March 22-23. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and Soviet Defense Minister <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> are also scheduled to discuss the issues at a meeting in <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, on March 16-17. The foreign ministers announced no major breakthroughs in the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks -LRB- START -RRB-, which President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> have agreed should cut superpower nuclear arsenals to 6,000 warheads, a reduction of 30 percent to 50 percent, depending on how the weapons are counted. Among the major points of disagreement are a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal to limit the number of Soviet land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> ICBM </ORGANIZATION>'s -RRB- to 3,300, no more than 1,630 of which can be on rockets carrying seven or more warheads. And the Soviets are demanding limits on the number of cruise missiles aboard submarines and aircraft. One administration source said, `` It's going to be tough to get a deal unless the two sides agree to mix and match,'' the formula adopted in the second Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty, signed in 1979. That pact set overall limits on warhead levels but did not achieve the limits on land-based Soviet ICBM's that the administration has been seeking under START. Some analysts believe that no START deal is possible unless the superpowers reach agreement on the degree to which the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty limits the testing of weapons developed under <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Strategic Defense Initiative. However, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has barred the administration from spending any money through next September on tests that would break the ABM pact, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts believe that enthusiasm for Star Wars will wane after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves office. `` Star Wars is probably a moot point,'' said an administration source. A spokesman at the Soviet embassy, <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Malkhov </PERSON>, said Tuesday that `` we are confident that technical obstacles can be overcome. We have the political will, and we think that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> does, also,'' to produce a START accord before the summit. -- -- EDITOR'S NOTE: <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Brumley </PERSON> writes on national security issues from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Tremors After Surgery Caused By Anesthetic Not Body Temperature</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Post-operative trembling endured by half the 25 million people who undergo surgery each year results from the use of anesthetics, not from decreased body temperature as had been assumed, according to a new study. The finding could lead to improved treatments to prevent the unpleasant and uncontrollable tremors that in some cases resemble a seizure and can be dangerous to patients, researchers said Tuesday. `` We now know that a very dramatic side effect of surgery has been misinterpreted for more than 35 years,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessler </PERSON>, assistant professor of anesthesia at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California-San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> and head of the study. <PERSON> Sessler </PERSON>, along with researchers at <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>, compared electrical signals produced in the muscles during normal shivering to those in nine women recovering from anesthetic after surgery. They found the post-surgical tremors were not related to body temperature, but matched tremors produced in people with severed spinal cords. Anesthetic, they found, wears off in the spine while the brain remains asleep, essentially disconnecting the spine from the brain's chemical messages. If the patient's skin gets cold, triggering shaking, the brain can not signal the muscle reflex to stop, <PERSON> Sessler </PERSON> said. After about 15 minutes, when the brain wakes up, the tremor stops, he said. `` People have been trying to do something for years about post-surgical tremors, but generally without success because they have been treating it as a thermo-regulatory problem,'' said <PERSON> Sessler </PERSON>, who reported the finding at last year's meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anesthesia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. The study will be published in the journal Anesthesiology this year. Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anesthesiologists </ORGANIZATION>, said the finding will not drastically alter current practice at hospitals, which already use lamps or blankets once tremors begin. But according to <PERSON> Sessler </PERSON>, warming the skin with infrared heating lamps or even something as simple as a hair dryer while the patient is still asleep should prevent the tremors altogether. `` Infrared heating lamps are used empirically in some hospitals and have already been shown to work ...,'' said <PERSON> Sessler </PERSON>. `` But most do n't treat this except with blankets. Routinely keeping the patient warm would prevent this, even a modest increase in the warming system.'' The shaking, which can occur with almost all general anesthetics in use today, can raise the patient's heart rate and blood pressure, in addition to pulling apart incisions and damaging teeth, <PERSON> Sessler </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> differed with <PERSON> Sessler </PERSON>'s estimate that half of all surgical patients experience some tremors, from mild to severe. He said such cases are rare and are usually not serious. The condition is most common among patients treated in cold operating rooms, such as those receiving hip or knee replacement, he said. Orthopedic surgeons keep the temperature at around 62 degrees because of the heavy gowns they must wear and the air conditioning system, both designed to prevent infection, he said. In a separate study, <PERSON> Sessler </PERSON>'s research team disproved another assumption _ that surgery patients lose all ability to control body temperature. Anesthetics do not eliminate control but instead lower the threshold for cold. The regulatory reaction occurs, but at a much lower body temperature than normal, they found.

 Selection of a site for the $ 4.4 billion `` super collider'' atom smasher will be delayed by up to four months to prepare a draft environmental impact statement before, instead of after, the choice, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. Word of the delay, from July to November or December, came in budget questioning of Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> before the <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He was asked whether he would pick the site before or after the committee acts on his request for $ 363 million in construction funds for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. `` I do n't see us making the decision'' before the committee must act, <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said. `` I would guess a preferred site would be selected in November or December.'' The department has planned for more than a year to chose the final site in July and confirm it in January, subject to preparation of an environmental impact statement. Department spokesman <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> said later that <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> now believes it is better to do more work on the environmental impact statement and complete a draft covering all possible sites before chosing the final site. `` That will be on the street and people will be able to comment on it, and we'll have the benefit of the comments in choosing the fon to delay announcement of a final site recommendation. `` The longer you go in with this project without getting the funding committed, the more risk there is it wo n't get funded,'' <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> winter meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` The more you narrow down the site selection, the less likely <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is to fund it.'' If <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> builds it, the superconducting super collider will investigate exotic scientific theories of the origin of matter by whirling beams of protons into each other at an energy 20 times greater than what is now possible. Believed to be the largest scientific instrument ever built, state governments are anxious to win the contest for the 53-miles-around tunnel because it will create 3,000 jobs and have an annual operating budget of $ 270 million. Besides <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> remain in the competition to build the collider.

 A two-pack-a-day woman who said she smokes just to annoy her husband was ordered not to light up in front of him or their three children and to confine her smoking to one room of their house, according to court papers made public Tuesday. The court order, from state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ralph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION>, says <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Roofeh </PERSON>, 41, of Kings Point on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, can be held in contempt if she breaks the rules. Mrs. <PERSON> Roofeh </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Jahanshah </PERSON>, a non-smoking orthopedic surgeon, went to court in an attempt to get his wife to stop smoking around the family. He claimed she had made a promise to that effect when they married in 1976. She said she broke the promise in 1984 only because of stress after suffering a stroke. She filed for divorce last May from her Iranian-born husband, whom she called `` an ayatollah.'' `` I smoke just to annoy him,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Roofeh </PERSON> said last year. `` I'll quit when I get him out of the house.'' In the suit, <PERSON> Roofeh </PERSON> claimed his wife's habit was `` offensive and detrimental to the health of the children,'' aged 6, 7, and 9. The husband had argued that smoking was as bad as punching or spitting and asked for an order of protection, but <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON> said such orders are designed to protect family members from domestic violence and would be too severe a remedy. Instead, he ordered that she never smoke in front of her husband or children and never smoke at home except in the family's small TV room. Mrs. <PERSON> Roofeh </PERSON> said Tuesday that the ruling, dated Monday, was `` nothing new.'' She said she had already been refraining from smoking in front of the children and confining her smoking to the TV room. In an affidavit, she had agreed that smoking is `` detrimental to the health of the smoker and those who passively inhale the smoker's smoke.'' <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Navesky </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the judge, said extensive research into state law had not found any similar ruling.

 The sisters of kidnapped Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said he appeared well on a tape released Monday by his Lebanese extremist kidnappers. `` He looks good, considering what he's been through in the last few weeks, but he is under a lot of stress,'' said his sister, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, of the <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Okolona </LOCATION>. `` It's strange to be seeing this. It's something you think can never happen to you,'' said another sister, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, who is visiting Mrs. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>. On the scratchy tape, <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, and grew up in nearby <LOCATION> Garrard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, read a list of demands that had to be met in order to obtain his release, including withdrawal by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from its border `` security zone'' in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, 43, head of a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> observer force in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, was kidnapped last Wednesday as he drove alone in a jeep on the higihway south of Tyre, about 50 miles from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. A group calling itself the Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, which claimed responsibility for the abduction, released the 70-second tape. `` I do n't believe he thought it could happen to him. I believe he thought he was safe,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said of her brother. Both Mrs. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said their brother would not want the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to give in to the kidnappers' demands. `` He would want them to take a hard line, not give in to them, to stand up for the rights that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> believes in,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. While both sisters said they were glad to see that their brother was alive, they realized it could be a long wait. Currently, there are eight other Americans being held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, for as long as nearly three years. `` He would n't want us to just stop our lives because he's in this situation,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said she would like to be able to get word to her brother of the death of their father, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> Sr. The elder <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> died Thursday, the day after his son's abduction, without knowing what had happened to the Marine. Mrs. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said she also had a message for her brother's kidnappers `` Please let him come home. Please release him.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> illegally obtained a suspected Shiite Lebanese terrorist's confession to leading a 1985 airplane hijacking during `` relentless interrogation'' that violated his rights, a judge ruled Tuesday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> suppressed oral and written confessions that <PERSON> Fawaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> gave to agents after he was lured aboard an FBI-chartered yacht in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> last Sept. 13. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> ruled the statements were inadmissable as evidence because <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> was denied his constitutional protection against self-incrimination and his right to legal counsel during four days of questioning aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ship in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. `` Somehere along the way, in its zeal and determination to indict and prosecute an alleged hostage-taker and hijacker under recent congressional enactments, and in securing <PERSON> Fawaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>' written confession, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> failed to comply fully with constitutional restraints and predecential <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said in a 47-page opinion `` Law enforcement agencies must follow the letter and the spirit of the law, even though the accused is not a citizen of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> `` failed to do so in September 1987 when it interrogated the defendant.'' <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> was arrested when a friend who had become a government informant lured him onto an FBI-chartered yacht with the prospect of making a drug deal. Prosecutors say they have a videotape and other statements from witnesses that place <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> at the scene of the June 11, 1985, hijacking of a Royal Jordanian jetliner from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. He is scheduled to go to trial March 22 before <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> on charges that he led hijacking, during which the plane was blown up after passengers and crew were taken off the aircraft. Although <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> declined to rule that the arrest was illegal, he concluded that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> deliberately kept <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> aboard the USS Butte for four days to obtain a confession in `` a clear abuse of the obligation to bring the defendant before a judicial officer immediately following his arrest.'' `` The slow voyage across the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> appeared to serve only the government's purposes _ ample time to educe a confession,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. `` That deliberate action coupled with the lengthy and relentless interrogation was all to the defendant's prejudice and detriment. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> launched its plan to abduct <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> early last year under the direction of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Revell </PERSON>, the bureau's executive assistant director, who witnessed the arrest and was aboard the Butte for part of its four-day voyage, according to testimony. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>' `` capacity for self-determination was critically impaired'' by seasickness and throbbing pain from wrists that were fractured when agents slammed him to the deck of the yacht, Skunk Kilo, following his arrest, <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. The judge noted that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> kept <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> in windowless, overheated room aboard the ammunition ship as it steamed slowly from waters off <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> to a rendezvous with the USS Saratoga four days later. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> was then flown from the carrier to <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, Md. The defendant had been advised of his rights to remain silent once during his interrogation, but `` In an uncertain physical condition, in an oppressive environment, and subject to relentless interrogation, <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> lacked the will necessary to voluntarily waive his rights,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. `` We are reviewing the decision carefully within our office and with our colleagues in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reardon </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, principal assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney, said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnitzer </PERSON> said the bureau would not comment on the decision. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> also criticized the ship's doctors for providing inadequate medical treatment and `` negligent diagnosis'' despite <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>' `` constant complaints'' about the pain. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> was given ice packs but his wrists were not X-rayed and put into casts until after he was flown to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said he was `` extremely troubled'' by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to provide <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> with a defense lawyer `` despite the meticulous detail of Operation Goldenrod'' _ the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s code-name for the effort. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> could arrange to have a medical surgical team of five doctors and several tons of medical equipment aboard the Butte, would it have been too difficult to arrange for a competent and detached attorney?'' Besides the confession, prosecutors also have the testimony of two Americans who identified <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> as one of five men who boarded the plane with AK-47 assault rifles. They also have the testimony of <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamdan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>' one-time friend who had several conversations with him about the hijacking. In addition, prosecutors have a videotape of <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> reading a statement to reporters before the plane was blown up in the background.

 The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday declared <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s $ 1.49 billion budget unconstitutional because it contains a deficit, and the state auditor's office said all state spending would cease immediately. `` We've got to quit everything right now,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, chief clerk for Auditor <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gainer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said no further expenditures of state money can be made until the $ 26 million deficit in the current budget is corrected. There was a unanimous reaction of shock at the decision, which had been pending for months. `` The governor has been saying it's unconstitutional since June. I'm sure he'll be interested to hear that,'' said Gov. <PERSON> Arch </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s press aide, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> at a governor's conference Tuesday and could not immediately be reached for comment. The court ruled in a 3-2 decision, in an opinion written by Justice <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> McGraw </PERSON>, did not tell Gov. <PERSON> Arch </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and the Legislature what to do about the unconstitutional budget. `` ... We presume the governor and <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> will do their duties,'' <PERSON> McGraw </PERSON> wrote. The decision resulted from a lawsuit brought by the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> last year that challenged cuts in funding for education. The association did not seek to have the budget declared unconstitutional but asked that <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> be forced to call a special session to address the problem. In his response, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> did not contest the allegations and said the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> budgeted $ 26 million more than he had said would be available in revenues. He said the document was unconstitutionally out of balance. The state Constitution's requires `` that the estimate of revenue and the budgeted appropriation be in balance so as not to create a deficit.'' But the high court said it refused to tell the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> and the governor what they should do to correct the problem and rejected the education association's request that a special legislative session be ordered. It said the branches of government are equal and the court presumes that the executive and legislative branches will do what they are supposed to do.

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> affirmed the dream of a former Boy Scout Tuesday by dedicating a national trail he conceived to show tourists landmarks that illustrate the rich history of blacks in the nation's capital.

 Two Republicans said Tuesday their $ 375 million child care improvement bill is far more likely to become law than a multibillion-dollar alternative sponsored by Democrats. `` It's closer to what the president is going to sign than anything else on the table or under discussion,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., House sponsor of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> bill `` It is practical. It is realistic. It is doable.'' The plan sponsored by <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, relies on state regulation and private initiatives. The $ 2.5 billion <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> proposal requires federal regulation and, among other things, provides more direct aid to low-income families. `` There's no way they can get that past a Democrat president, let alone this president,'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said he would have to `` sit down and negotiate'' with Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., sponsor of the Democratic bill in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> He predicted no child care bill would pass unless it comes close to what he has proposed. But <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> already have had `` numerous conversations'' about the two child care proposals, with little to show for them. `` I frankly feel that under any of the presidential candidates, I would fare better with my child care proposal than under this administration,'' <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said. `` So unless I sense that Sen. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> and others are willing to move more in our direction to really target low - and moderate-income families, I am going to be unwilling to necessarily reach a compromise this year. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> initially introduced his bill last year, saying conservatives had to take a leadership role in resolving the child care problems faced by many working families. He reintroduced it Tuesday with some refinements and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s companion measure in the House. The bill provides $ 250 million for state grants to projects designed to improve or expand child care or make it more affordable, $ 100 million for liability pools that any licensed provider could join and $ 25 million for capital improvements to regulated day care homes. In addition it would limit provider liability, give tax credits to employers with on-site child care and offer a double tax exemption to families in which a parent stayed home for six months to care for a newborn. The break would be worth about $ 500 to $ 600 to the average family. Though some experts have said state regulation of day care is inconsistent and in some cases very poor, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said that would change because the bill requires state regulation and will stimulate debate. `` When that debate becomes public ... it results in good standards,'' she said. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> also said the bill would decrease the incidence of `` underground'' providers because it addresses the liability problem and simplifies taxes for family day care providers. `` If you do n't deal with those disincentives, you're not going to bring people into the regulated system,'' she said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, urged the federal government Tuesday to take action on child care, including a `` modest'' commitment of funds to help poor working families. The governors, ending their three-day winter meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, called for the public and private sectors to work in concert on the problem, and said that despite the deficit, `` the federal government should begin to take action to improve child care.'' But President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Monday cautioned the governors to `` tread carefully'' on the issue of child care. `` Maybe it's my conservative bent, but I ca n't help but feel uneasy sometimes'' about proposals to seek government solutions to such problems, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> described their bill as bipartisan, although most Democrats are supporting the Dodd bill, introduced in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> by Rep. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Kildee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mich </LOCATION>. Proponents of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> measure say a strong federal role is needed to unify and strengthen the current piecemeal system and to give the private sector a framework in which to invest. Only 5 percent of employers currently offer day care services or direct financial aid to pay for them.

 Thousands of people marched in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> on Tuesday to demand control of territory assigned to another republic, dramatically illustrating tensions among the nation's 100 nationalities. Demonstrations in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, capital of the southern <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION>, followed protests in the disputed area, a small mountainous region just north of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. A former political prisoner said from <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> that the protesters want the small area _ part of the neighboring republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION> _ to be made part of the republic of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> because many Armenians live there. Other problems between different nationalities have led to demonstrations in the republics of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>. Nationalist demonstrations have increased since <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> gained power in March 1985 and adopted a policy of `` glasnost,'' or openness on selected social issues. On Feb. 10, he said developing a nationalities policy is `` the most vital, fundamental issue of our society.'' Dissidents in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said Tuesday at least 100,000 demonstrators took to the streets in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, but a participant claimed later the number was 200,000. In either case, it appeared to be one of the largest unofficial gatherings ever reported in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The government acknowledged `` breaching of public order'' took place in the the disputed area, <PERSON> Nagorno-Karabakhskaya </PERSON>, and said the territorial demands were against the public interest. <PERSON> Tamara </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> dissident whose husband is Armenian, said the disputed area in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> was given to neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION> in the early 1920s although most of its inhabitants are Armenian. <PERSON> Paruyr </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON>, a 38-year-old former political prisoner, said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> that protests began late Monday and continued Tuesday. <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> is 1,100 miles south of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` No one slept all night,'' he said. `` We gathered at the opera house at about 11 p.m. and stayed out demonstrating until 5 a.m.. About 200,000 people massed outside the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> headquarters and the Supreme Soviet. About one-third of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s 3.3 million people live in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> led an underground Armenian nationalist group called the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and was jailed for 17 years beginning in 1969. He said he now is chairman of a nationalist group called <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Determination </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier this month, he said, the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakhskaya </LOCATION> government council asked that the region be made part of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, citing the constitutional guarantee of the right of self-determination. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> rejected the request, and demonstrations followed in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakhskaya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> said. Soldiers brought in tanks to quell protests in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakhskaya </LOCATION> and rumors circulated that some demonstrators were killed, he said. The government made its comment through the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, and the dispatch was read later on the national evening news program. `` Breaching of public order was provoked as a result of irresponsible calls by extremist individuals,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said of events in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakhsaya </LOCATION>. It said the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` holds that the actions and demands directed at revising the existing national and territorial structure contradict the interests of the working people in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and damages inter-ethnic relations.'' The Central Committee urged residents `` not to yield to provocations by nationalist elements'' and said all measures would be taken to `` safeguard public order,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. It did not give the number of demonstrators or say what actions were taken to stop the protest. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON>, a former political prisoner who lives in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, said demonstrators in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> chanted the slogan, `` One nation, one republic!'' <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Demirchyan </PERSON>, the Armenian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, went on television Monday night asking people to be calm, but thousands gathered outside the opera whistled and jeered, <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> said. Police followed the demonstrators as they marched through <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> but did not detain or harrass the protesters, <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> said. He added that rumors were circulating of authorities sending martial arts experts to the city to cause disorder and provide police with a pretext for intervention. Problems of nationalities gained prominence last summer in the Baltic republics, and there were street demonstrations in <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> to mark the anniversary of a secret German-Soviet agreement that led to the Soviet takeover of the three countries in 1940. On Feb. 16 in <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, there was a heavy presence of police patrolling the streets and squares in an apparent move to prevent any demonstrations on the 70th anniversary of Lithuanian independence. Estonian dissidents plan more protests Wednesday. In the Central Asian republic of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>, at least 3,000 people rioted Dec. 17-18, 1986, in the capital <ORGANIZATION> Alma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ata </ORGANIZATION> to protest appointment of an ethnic Russian to replace a Kazakh as the republic's party leader.

<HEAD>Analyst Says Bush's TV News Image Rose As His Campaign Faltered</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Network news stories on Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were generally negative before the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> caucuses but became much more favorable after his poor showing there, a media analyst said Tuesday. There were 157 on-air evaluations of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as a candidate on evening newscasts from Jan. 1 to Feb. 16, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON>, who has been logging and analyzing television coverage of all the contenders since early last year. From Jan. 1 to Feb. 8, before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s third-place <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> finish, 61 percent of the evaluations were negative. From Feb. 9 through Feb. 16, between the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hamphire </LOCATION> contests, only 34 percent of the evaluations were negative. <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON> called the trend `` a dramatic upturn'' that illustrates the media tendency to treat front-runners more critically than the rest of the pack. `` As <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s prospects dim ... suddenly for the first time in this campaign he starts to get good press,'' <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON> said. Part of the shift involved the virtual disappearance of stories about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s role in the Iran-Contra affair, <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON> said. Before the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses Feb. 8, there were twice as many stories about Iran-Contra as there were about any other policy issue. Then Iran-Contra `` dropped from sight,'' he said. <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON> showed snippets of pre-Iowa campaign coverage that included several pointed comments from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief rival, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. In one nightly news clip, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> never said anything at leadership meetings. `` I do n't know, maybe he was just holding back,'' he said. In another, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said he had `` a record of leadership. ... I ca n't help it if he -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- ca n't provide any.'' After the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, sample clips showed <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> calling her husband `` wiser and smarter'' than the other candidates. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> Correspondent <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettit </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was `` not a quitter. He's a very determined man.'' And a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> truck driver told an interviewer that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` seems a lot taller and sterner than I thought he would be.'' <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON> said most positive comments come from candidates and their families while negative ones come from others in the race. The trend worked to the disadvantage of Democrats because they kept picking on each other _ particularly during debates, he said. Sample clips of the Democrats included some acerbic comments on the so-called <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> miracle touted by Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as evidence of his successful economic policies. `` I went to divinity school and they have a tougher definition of the word miracle,'' Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, D-Tenn., said during one debate Rep. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> provided many instances of Democratic sniping picked up by network news. Among the clips: `` It is legitimate for me to say where are you going? Who is the real <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>?'' said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, defending an anti-Gephardt television ad. `` I asked Sen. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> to take those ads off television,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said. `` And if he does n't, he should take off his bow tie because he's just another politician.'' <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> coverage of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stayed just about the same after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s confrontation with <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s positive evaluations on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> dropped sharply from about 50 percent to 27 percent after the set-to, <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON> said the negative CBS coverage may have been `` one blip'' attributable to `` a lot of anger'' over the incident. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stories on CBS since <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> are in the same ballpark as other networks _ about 60 percent positive. `` Horse-race'' comments about a candidate's chances were not included in the tallies of positive and negative evaluations. Comments that were counted came from candidates, their families and aides, network correspondents, independent experts and others. <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON> is a fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and co-director of the Center for Media and Policy Studies. Besides tracking network news coverage of the candidates, he is also monitoring election-year political humor on the <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> shows.

<HEAD>Monitors Should Hit Big Overpayments in State Assistance Programs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal monitors of state-run family assistance programs should penalize only those states with excessive rates of overpayments, a congressional study said Tuesday. Moreover, the report by the <ORGANIZATION> Nationa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said the current federal monitoring system should be replaced with one that measures state efforts to accomplish the social purposes of the programs rather than just financial accountability. Recommendations of the panel, an operating arm of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, are based on an 18-month study ordered by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The new report focuses on Aid to Families with Dependent Children and Medicaid. A similar report issued last May concentrated on the Food Stamp program. The underlying call for different ways of measuring effectiveness applied to all three programs, which account for about 40 percent of total federal spending on the poor. <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> is the only state that has escaped sanctions that are expected to total $ 3 billion by 1989. Nearly all of the 49 states facing sanctions are appealing and some are challenging them in court. Intended to deter overpayment errors in the three programs, penalties are imposed if a state's error rate exceeds 5 percent of its Food Stamp payments and 3 percent of its AFDC and Medicaid payments. The panel endorsed the concept of imposing sanctions for improperly run programs, but said the overpayment error rate should not be the sole criteria of a state's performance. It said the present monitoring system does not provide the `` detailed data that are needed for identifying and correctioning problems at the service-delivery level.'' Because of uncertainties in the available information, sanctions should be limited to `` extremely bad performers'' until a more comprehensive method of measuring performance is developed, the panel said. It said federal officials should measure the states against each other, rather than the present absolute gauge, and penalize only those with `` excessively large'' error rates. However, the report did not specify a cutoff point as being `` exessively large'' and said, `` There is no absolutely reliable way of determining, say, the 10 states with the highest error rates.''

 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> receieved top scores Tuesday in a ranking of state environmental protection programs by an advocacy group, the Fund for Renewable Energy and the Environment. The two states received 45 points out of a possible 60 in the group's subjective assessments of programs in six areas: surface water protection, pesticide control, highway safety, land use planning, indoor pollution and pollution from energy production and use. Not far behind in the rankings were <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> with 44 points each and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> with 43. At the bottom of the list were <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> with 19 points, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> with 17 and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> with 15. In the separate areas, the group put these states first: <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> in surface water protection; <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in pesticide protection; <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> in land use planning; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> in combating indoor pollution; <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> in highway safety; and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> in energy pollution control. In an introduction to the report, <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, chairman of the fund, said, `` Slowly, the environmental community has come to recognize that our responsibility is not discharged simply by passing sweeping legislation. ... The real success must be won in the trenches. `` The purpose of this study is to share information on how the battle is going in the trenches.'' This is the second report from the fund. Last year's examined outdoor air pollution, soil conservation, solid waste and recycling, hazardous waste management, groundwater protection and renewable energy and conservation. The fund said it plans to look at each area every three years. The rankings tried to account for the existence of state legislation, the scope of programs, financing, monitoring and enforcement and indications of progress. The report singled out <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, which imposed $ 697,000 in penalties for water pollution under a new state program. Among other points, the report said: _ <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> `` have more than one-fifth of the major municipal public treatment works in significant non-compliance'' with their water pollution discharge permits _ Most states rely on local government zoning ordinances for controls on land use, and statewide programs were found only in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> _ Forty-two states have passed laws limiting smoking in public places, and 22 states and more than 200 local governments restrict smoking to some degree on the job _ Though not one of the traditional environmental issues, `` Highways are one of our most dangerous daily environments,'' and `` The automobile is also the machine with the single greatest impact on our environment,'' accounting for half of air pollution

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday it intends to build incinerators at eight ammunition depots around the country to destroy old chemical weapons because it does n't want to risk moving the munitions. `` I think we could do it either way,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ambrose </PERSON>, the under secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and the official who made the final decision. `` But it is my judgment in rendering this decision that it is much more sensible in every respect, and far less complex and I think on the whole ... less risky, to do it where it is. `` We think we can exercise much better control on a combined federal reservation than we can transporting this stuff over many states and through cities and the like,'' he said. <PERSON> Ambrose </PERSON>'s decision was hardly a surprise. The Army has favored on-site destruction of its old chemical stocks ever since it began studying the matter more than two years ago, and just last December released an environmental impact study supporting that approach. Some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, however, including Rep. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, R-Ky., have contested the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s plans, saying the service has n't demonstrated the safety of incinerating chemical weapons at storage depots located near population centers <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said Tuesday he was not surprised by <PERSON> Ambrose </PERSON>'s decision, but thought the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> had reneged on an earlier agreement to conduct a more `` site-specific'' study of each depot. `` In my view, on-site incineration is unsafe and unthinkable in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said. `` We have the most amount of population and the least amount of chemicals.'' The service is now constructing a prototype incineration plant on <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> <PERSON> Atoll </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> _ where another chemical weapons depot is maintained _ to demonstrate the safety of the destruction process, <PERSON> Ambrose </PERSON> noted. `` We think these plants are extremely safe,'' he said at a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> briefing. `` We think the safety is greatly in excess of that required by any of the known rules and laws.'' The Army's No. 2 civilian leader said the service now hopes to begin building the eight incineration plants by 1989 or 1990, but conceded that timetable could be slowed by litigation or by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. While <PERSON> Ambrose </PERSON> said he was comfortable with his decision, he said he fully expects to see lawsuits challenging the move. `` I've had even some people I wo n't identify assure me that they'll sue me either way,'' he said to laughter. The Army's stockpile of so-called unitary chemical weapons, in which shells and bombs are filled with a variety of nerve gases and poisons such as mustard gas, is now on average more than 25 years old. Although the Army wo n't say how large the stockpile is _ citing secrecy classifications _ published estimates have ranged from 25,000 tons to 40,000 tons. The weapons are stored at the <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION> Proving Ground, Md.; <ORGANIZATION> Anniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Lexington-Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ammunition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>.; Pine Bluff Arsenal, Ark.; <ORGANIZATION> Pueblo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Tooele </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Umatilla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION>, Ore. The Army is under orders from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to begin destroying the old stock as it begins producing a new type of chemical weapon considered to be more safe. Those new `` binary'' weapons are made with two harmless chemicals that are kept separate until after the artillery round or rocket is fired, mixing then to form a lethal gas. <PERSON> Ambrose </PERSON> said Tuesday he had closely studied the Army environmental impact study before accepting its rejection of four alternatives to on-site incineration. Those alternatives included transporting the weapons by rail for destruction at plants to be built at <LOCATION> Tooele </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Anniston </LOCATION>; transporting by rail to a single national disposal center at <LOCATION> Tooele </LOCATION>; airlifting the <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION> weapons to <LOCATION> Tooele </LOCATION> for destruction, with on-site destruction at the other locations, and continued storage at the current sites. `` These devices are there,'' <PERSON> Ambrose </PERSON> said. `` They've been there for some time. They will not go away. They should be gotten rid of. They will not turn into something completely harmless by themselves. `` I have simply concluded that the ability to control -LRB- transportation -RRB- actions and to take the necessary precautions in large-scale movements ... is just much more of a formidable, complex and uncertain task than to keep these materials under close control at these locations and to perform the incineration there.'' The Army could probably save about $ 200 million if it built a single large incineration plant instead of eight small ones, but the risk of large-scale movement of the weapons is not worth it, <PERSON> Ambrose </PERSON> added. If all goes well, <PERSON> Ambrose </PERSON> said it would cost between $ 2 billion and $ 2.5 billion to dispose of the old weapons and that the job could be completed by 1996 or 1997. It would then take another year or so to dismantle the eight incineration plants, he said.

 Flight attendants at <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> have voted overwhelmingly to strike the airline this weekend unless a contract dispute over wages and benefits is resolved, a union official said Monday. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Musto </PERSON>, a spokesman for Teamsters Local 2747 representing 6,500 <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> attendants, said 94.4 percent of the more than 5,000 attendants participating voted to strike Saturday. Strike authorization required a two-thirds majority. `` The strike authorization of 94.4 percent reflects the deplorable state of labor relations at <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Musto </PERSON> said at a news conference, reading a statement prepared by the local. `` <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> labor relations does not comprehend the severity of the labor situation at this carrier,'' the statement read. <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Redmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> said he was not surprised by the strike vote and said the airline expected to continue operating most of its flights if a strike occurred. Meanwhile Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union at <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> threatened to disrupt the airline over a contract impasse but stopped short of calling a strike. The strike deadline for the union, which represents 4,500 <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> baggage handlers, reservations clerks and other ground personnel, passed at 12:01 a.m. Sunday. No negotiations were scheduled for Monday. Teamsters officials said they would use tactics such as sending baggage to the wrong airports and canceling reservations. <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> officials and the union would hold a negotiating session Tuesday `` with the cooperation of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and we continue to remain optimistic that our contract will be resolved.'' The two sides have not negotiated since the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> released them from mandatory negotiations last month, when they deadlocked over wages, fringe benefits and work rules. A 30-day cooling-off period ends at 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday, at which time the attendants may strike and <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> may impose a new contract. About 2,000 Northwest managers are qualified to be flight attendants and would be used during a strike, according to the airline, which also advertised earlier this month for flight attendants. But Northwest last week told 5,300 mechanics and baggage handlers they could be laid off if the flight attendants went on strike. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 20,000 ground workers at <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, and the pilots' union have not said if they would honor a strike by the flight attendants. In the last strike against <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, the machinists union walked out for 27 days in May 1982. Northwest merged with the Minneapolis-based <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 and the company and its major unions have been involved in talks on new contracts ever since. Many former Republic employees are paid less than their Northwest counterparts, a cause of friction between labor and management. Northwest's latest proposal to the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> offers immediate elimination of pay gaps between former <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> and former Republic flight attendants and deals with the other areas of disagreement. The proposed five-year agreement calls for pay increases for former Republic flight attendants ranging from 17 percent to 26 percent, according to <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Erskine </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president of labor relations. Senior flight attendants earn about $ 35,000 annually; starting pay is about $ 15,000 a year, he said. But <PERSON> Musto </PERSON> said Monday that `` even though it does show a pay raise for the Republic people, the end result would be a pay cut if you put a dollars and cents figure on things being taken away form the Republic people.'' <PERSON> Musto </PERSON> said the proposal would mean less vacation pay and, `` in the long run, you would get less retirement benefits.''

 A federal judge ruled Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is liable for the cost _ estimated at more than $ 250 million _ of cleaning up the <LOCATION> Love </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> landfill that became synonymous with environmental disaster. After nine years of deliberations, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtin </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> produced the wastes and stored them in a way that would eventually result in toxic leakage. `` It is beyond dispute that <ORGANIZATION> OCC </ORGANIZATION>'s disposal practices were at least partially responsible for the release, or threatened release, of the chemicals from the Love Canal landfill,'' <PERSON> Curtin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Curtin </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION>'s liability would be determined in further court proceedings involving claims against <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> by other parties, including the state of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and some residents. Previous estimates have ranged above $ 250 million. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION>, said the company would appeal. `` Although we believe we are protected by insurance, we intend further to protect our rights by appeal from this extraordinary decision,'' <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> said. `` At last someobo ~ has been assigned some responsibility,'' said Sister <PERSON> Marjeen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffmann </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Ecumenical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> which has been an advocate for people in the <LOCATION> Love </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> neighborhood `` This is what we've been waiting for,'' she said. <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON>, a former Love Canal resident who now runs the Citizen's Clearing House for Hazardous Wastes in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said she hopes the company will be found liable for the full $ 250 million. `` That will at least make them blink,'' <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marzulla </PERSON>, acting assistant attorney general in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Land and Natural Resources Division, said the ruling shows <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> `` can not insulate itself from liability by blaming others.'' <PERSON> Curtin </PERSON>'s ruling upholds the federal <ORGANIZATION> Comprehensive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Response </ORGANIZATION>, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, which the judge said was designed to compel the waste disposal industry `` to correct its past mistakes and to provide a solution for the dangers posed by inactive abandoned waste sites.'' The law was passed 27 years after <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> yielded ownership of the landfill, transferring it to the <ORGANIZATION> Niagara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Falls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION>, formerly <ORGANIZATION> Hooker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plastic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, contended that it was not responsible for the site after 1953 when it sold the property to the school board, which built a school on the grounds. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> had acquired <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON> in 1968 and changed the name to <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> said the construction broke a clay seal on the dump and allowed the chemicals to leach into the environment. The company acknowledged dumping 20,000 tons of chemical wastes into the canal during the late 1940s and early 1950s. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Littlefield </PERSON>, assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for the <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> district, said the decision was `` a great victory for the state because it means companies are indeed responsible for what they've done in years past.'' <PERSON> Littlefield </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> would be liable for the `` bottom line'' on the cleanup costs. He said, however, the ruling allows <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> to sue other parties the chemical giant contends should share the responsibility. <PERSON> Nunzio </PERSON> <PERSON> Loverdi </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Love </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I think <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> should accept the decision and not take action against the city and <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> because if it does we will all suffer. We want to get on with our lives and put this behind us.'' Ten years ago, <LOCATION> Love </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> became synonymous with environmental disaster when state officials ordered an evacuation of children and pregnant women from the area because of leaking chemicals. President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> designated the 10-block site as a federal emergency area in 1978. The federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> began the suit against the company in 1979. During the next two years, 728 families were evacuated. Many of those were among the 1,300 former residents who accepted a $ 20 million damage settlement from <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> in 1984. Today, there are some 175 families awaiting the results of a state habitability study to decide whether they can return to their homes. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> has since proposed construction of a multimillion-dollar incinerator complex and offered to destroy dioxin-contaminated wastes. The offer marks the first time since the federal and state governments took over the cleanup in 1979 that the company has proposed any direct action or involvement in cleanup measures. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> officials are scheuled to make a formal proposal at a meeting March 2 in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>.

 Former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> grudgingly supported <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ratification of the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Soviet medium-range arms reduction agreement on Tuesday, saying it never should have been agreed to in its present form. But <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> said the treaty should be approved without crippling amendments because failure to do so would `` magnify all difficulties'' within the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance. `` The removal of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> intermediate range missiles -LRB- from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> -RRB- is now irreversible,'' because of the pressures of European public opinion and other factors, <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Because of that, he said, defeat of the treaty in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> `` would generate a crisis in the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> which in the end would almost certainly lead to the unilateral withdrawal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missiles from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and undermine the cohesion of the alliance.'' `` My concerns can not be removed by the refusal of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to ratify the agreement,'' <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> said. `` Failure to ratify ... can not cure its defects. Meanwhile, because they had `` manuevered themselves into a position where they think they now have no choice but to stand by proposals they never thought would be agreed to in the first place.'' The treaty is the result of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s 1979 `` dual-track'' decision to deploy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons to counter Soviet SS-20 medium-range missiles while at the same time negotiating their removal. `` They felt the obligation to imply that these weapons were there for arms control purposes and were therefore open to negotiation,'' <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> said of the European political leaders. <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> said he believes the treaty is flawed because it will not reduce in any significant way the ability of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to devastate <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> with other nuclear weapons and because it substantially reduces the ability of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to retaliate with nuclear weapons based in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Nuclear deterrence in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will now rely primarily on weapons based in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> said that creates `` a psychological and political imbalance,'' especially when weighed against Soviet superiority in conventional forces. But he said rejection of the treaty would severely undermine confidence in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> leadership, demoralize the alliance, and ignite neutralism. Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said his committee has `` high confidence'' in the ability of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to verify Soviet compliance with the treaty But `` there's a very big question mark about our ability to verify'' a separate treaty providing deep cuts in long-range nuclear weapons, <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said in an interview. `` The problem there is one of money, not technical ability,'' he explained. `` We have the capability, but the administration has to come forward and propose a budget plan to pay for it.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has been holding closed-door hearings for three weeks about verification capabilities. In his testimony, <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON> provided a detailed analysis as part of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s thorough examination of the pact signed 10 weeks ago by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The treaty will eliminate all nuclear-tipped missiles with ranges of about 300 to 3,000 miles. <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> committee members say the detailed scrutiny is needed because of disputes about the meaning of past treaties, particularly the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. The current treaty is being considered by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> amid a fight between the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration over the precise meaning of the 1972 pact and whether it banned futuristic weapons such as those being developed under the Strategic Defense Initiative. Article 14 of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces -LRB- INF -RRB- treaty says neither side shall do anything, now or in the future, to undercut the pact. Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, R-Ind., told <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON> that `` I'm concerned about article 14'' because it might limit future <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> help to other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations `` If we do n't spell out what the future obligations are,'' said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, `` down the road I can foresee some problems ... now is the time to give us as much running room as possible in the future for our technology.'' But <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON> took the opposite approach, noting that the treaty is extremely specific in spelling out prohibited weapons, along with their components. `` If it is not prohibited by the treaty, we can do it,'' said <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON>. Later, he added that `` we're best protected by stating what we can not do.'' <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON> cited one method in which he said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> would not be affected. The treaty bans cruise missiles, he said, but it does n't block the transfer of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technology to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations such as <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to develop cruise missiles. <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiating team resisted Soviet efforts to block <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> help for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. `` We knew their goal was to find a way to put a brake on <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> activities,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> promised Tuesday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will do its part to ensure that the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance remains strong, saying in an address broadcast to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that `` our destiny is coupled with yours.'' In the address, which came a week before a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit meeting, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> reaffirmed the alliance agreement that an attack on any member nation is an attack against all of them. `` Simply put, an attack on <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> is the same as an attack on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>,'' he said.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Tuesday picked a veteran Capitol Hill infighter, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, to step into a simmering dispute over <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget cuts as his new secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. The White House said the president will nominate <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> aide who has been chief lobbyist for both the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, to succeed <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, who resigned as <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary on Monday with a blast at Secretary of Defense <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>. `` We look to Will Ball to continue working aggressively for a strong <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, noting <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s charge that <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> had needlessly sacrificed the administration's goal of a 600-ship fleet. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration still seeks a 600-vessel <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, but now expects that the goal will be reached in fiscal year 1992, more than two years after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves office, rather than in fiscal 1989 as originally planned. `` The budget restructuring under way at the Pentagon now is a difficult and painful process,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` Secretary <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> is doing an admirable job. He's quite capable and suitable to the task, and he's carrying out thepresident's policies in that regard.'' Of Ball, he said, `` All of us who kFw him here at t Z\e <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> know that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is getting a strong advocate and a strong fighter both on the Hill as well as in any of the other courts of public opinion around the country.'' Ball, 39, a soft-spoken Southerner who came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as an aide to former Sen. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Talmadge </PERSON>, D-Ga., has a reputation for skill at the behind-the-scenes compromises and maneuvers needed to steer legislation through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, on the other hand, was more noted for outspoken advocacy of such controversial positions as his criticism of the service academies' admission of women and his ruling that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> would no longer accommodate officers who want to play professional sports. Ball has been assistant to the president for legislative affairs since February 1986. Before that he had been assistant secretary of state for legislative and intergovernmental affairs. From 1981 to 1985 he was administrative assistant to ` hen Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, serving also as chief clerk of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in 1981. He was <PERSON> Talmadge </PERSON>'s administrative assistant in 1978. A native of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, he is a graduate of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> and was a regular officer in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> from 1969 to 1975. As secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> will oversee approximately 584,000 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> personnel and 199,000 Marines. He will be succeeded at the White house by a deputy, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kranowicz </PERSON>, who has been primarily responsible for <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> lobbying efforts in the House. <PERSON> Kranowicz </PERSON> served as chief of staff to former Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Loeffler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, while <PERSON> Loeffler </PERSON> was in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> `` did the honorable thing'' in resigning when he could no longer support the president's policies. He said <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s service was `` distinguished and the president appreciates it very much.'' Later the White House released a letter from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> accepting the resignation `` with regret'' and saying, `` As your service to this administration comes to a close, I want to thank you for the selflessness and loyalty that you have always personified.'' <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said, `` The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> is very pleased that someone with such positive credentials has been named so quickly.'' `` It is a painful restructuring they are having to go through to absorb some of those reductions in spending levels,'' the presidential spokesman said. `` The president has been a strong advocate of the military and has worked hard to build it up over many years and feels that pain no less than anyone else.'' The budget cuts being carried out by <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> national security adviser who succeeded <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> at the Pentagon late last year, result from a compromise reached by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> with the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. In his budget message delivered last Thursday to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he had kept his part of the bargain and expected them to keep their part by appropriating the full amount agreed upon for Pentagon spending. Ball's nomination requires confirmation by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. He is expected to have little difficulty since the nomination will be reviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, many of whose members know him as a former aide to the panel and to Tower, who is a former member and chairman. In announcing his resignation Monday, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> charged that <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> had instructed him to deny news stories reporting that it was the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, not the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, that wanted to mothball ships. He also said <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> needed to `` spend a lot more time with the top leaders in this building -LRB- the Pentagon -RRB-,'' but instead had been `` spending a lot of time with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and a lot of time on the Hill.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> declined to respond, saying only that he had learned of <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s resignation with `` regret.''

 <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> suggested on Tuesday that political motivations lay behind the timing of sexual-misconduct allegations against TV evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, and he also accused <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign of planning religiously bigoted television commercials. He provided no evidence to support his accusation on the timing of the <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> story, and he declined to say who might be behind any such effort. However, he said the vice president's campaign was the only one in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential race that has been engaging in `` dirty tricks.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s comments brought heated denials from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ~ others in the vice president's campaign Asked about <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s charge during a campaign stop in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> challenged him to `` prove it.'' Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked if he could say his campaign had no connection with the timing of the Swaggart story. `` That's a hundred percent accurate,'' he replied. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he saw no reason anyway to connect the <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> story with <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, himself a former television evangelist. `` I do n't think it's fair to burden <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> with something with <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggert </PERSON>. I do n't think that's fair play,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` On the other hand, if he accuses me of something, I'm perfectly prepared to defend us.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s state campaign chairman, said, `` If somebody makes a specific charge then they certainly ought to have to come forward with some proof I think it's a rather ridiculous charge myself.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said evidence indicating <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> had been involved with prostitutes had lain `` dormant since last October.'' It `` stretches the imagination and stretches credulity'' that revelations of such allegations came two weeks `` before the most important primary in the nation,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate said during a news conference. He was referring to the primaries and caucuses that 20 states will hold on March 8, known as Super Tuesday. `` I think somebody had something to do with it,'' said <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. `` Somebody else planned all these things, I am afraid.'' He also said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign was guilty of dirty tricks against him and was planning more in the form of advertisements before the Super Tuesday primaries. `` They will attack my religious beliefs and practices and I'm going to call them before it happens,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> officials said that accusation was n't true. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> declined to say what led him to make the charge. Concerning his statement that the <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> controversy was politically orchestrated, he said a prominent journalist, whom he declined to name, `` told me something like that might have gone on.'' He said it was the news media's duty to determine whether or not it was true.

<TEXT>
 A space agency engineer who pressed for a delay in the launch of the ill-fated space shuttle Challenger started work Monday at the private aerospace company that built the shuttle booster rocket. <PERSON> Judson </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovingood </PERSON>, 51, joined several other top-ranking officials in leaving the <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> since the seven crew members died in the Challenger explosion two years ago. <PERSON> Lovingood </PERSON> retired Saturday from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, where he had worked for 25 years, instead of taking an assignment at <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as deputy director of systems engineering and analysis for the shuttle program. `` He elected to retire in lieu of accepting the assignment for economic and other reasons,'' said a <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Drachlis </PERSON>. `` Dr. <PERSON> Lovingood </PERSON> has said that he has worked on the shuttle since 1969. The Challenger accident has exacted a great personal toll and he felt it was time for a change.'' <PERSON> Lovingood </PERSON>'s new job is technical director of <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>. He said through a <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman that he will be responsible for `` overseeing some technical activities'' at the <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION> division of <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>, whose main shuttle plant is in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. His activities were not specified, but he said the company's <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION> operation has little connection with the shuttle program. <PERSON> Lovingood </PERSON> was deputy manager of the shuttle projects office at <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> when <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> engineers recommended against launching the shuttle in cold weather at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> on Jan. 28, 1986. `` I was contacted about 4:30 that afternoon -LRB- Jan. 27 -RRB- by a guy from the cape,'' <PERSON> Lovingood </PERSON> said. `` A point was being made and the point being that I heard that <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> people were recommending that we not launch,'' he said. `` I felt like with a recommendation like that that we should n't launch, period.'' A presidential commission that investigated the disaster concluded that the decision-making process prior to the launch was flawed, with the views of <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> engineers overruled and critical concerns not relayed to top <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> levels, where officials were pushing for a launch. The commission said flawed O-rings in the booster rocket allowed hot gases to leak through to the external fuel tank.

 <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s campaign lawyer contended Tuesday that the campaign has not used the $ 6.5 million it received in federal matching funds even though its financial report shows it has less than that on hand. The matching funds were used to secure a $ 5.5 million loan during January, said campaign attorney <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, but he added that the campaign does not consider that was using the money. `` The matching funds are 100 percent in an escrow account,'' and none has been spent, <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. When asked why the campaign's financial statement filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> showed $ 5.5 million in cash on hand, $ 1 million less than the matching funds he said were in the bank, <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said he did not prepare the report and could not explain it. Campaign aides did not return calls Monday and Tuesday to answer questions about the report. Whether or not the <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> campaign has accepted the matching funds is significant because presidential candidates who are declared eligible for such funds must abide by spending limits under federal regulations. The <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> campaign contends that it does not have to abide by the limits unless it actually uses the money, and considers that although it put the funds into its bank, it still has the option of sending the money back and bypassing the spending limts, said <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>. `` That will be our contention if we decide not to accept them,'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said. `` It's a decision that has n't been made yet.'' <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Eiland </PERSON> said, `` That's sort of a dubious argument, but the commission would have to answer that.'' He noted that candidates must sign an agreement to abide by the spending limits even before they actually get the matching funds. The spending cap issue is more important for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> than for any other presidential candidate because he is by far the closest to the limit. The cap is $ 23 million for the primary season plus another 20 percent, or $ 4.6 million, allowed for fund-raising expenses. As of the end of January, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> reported spending $ 17.6 million against the $ 23 million cap, plus $ 4.3 million against the fund-raising cap. Those figures did not include February's spending toward the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> contests, Tuesday's <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> contests or the Super Tuesday primaries in 20 states on March 8. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said the $ 5.5 million loan from <ORGANIZATION> Sovran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> was secured, but neither he nor the bank's regional executive officer, <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Slattum </PERSON>, would disclose what collateral was required. The loan was bigger by far than any taken out by the other candidates. Election law requires that banks treat presidential campaign loans in the normal course of business, with no special considerations applied. <PERSON> Slattum </PERSON> cited customer privacy considerations and refused to divulge any information about <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s loan, the bank's general lending practices, or even the cities included in the region <PERSON> Slattum </PERSON> heads. <PERSON> Slattum </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> also declined to give the date the loan was taken out although <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Eiland </PERSON> said that is required on the disclosure reports. The report listed the date only as January 1988. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> also used his matching funds to secure a $ 1.5 million loan in December from <LOCATION> Sovran </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. That loan was paid back on Jan. 10. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> reported spending during January of $ 7.9 million, more than any other presidential campaign, and ended the month with $ 5.5 million in cash on hand and $ 6 million in outstanding debts.

<HEAD>One Dead In Election Denounced By Church Leader, Politicians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new election system in which people vote for candidates by lining up behind them led to one death and widespread charges of fraud, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> newspapers reported Tuesday. The purpose of Monday night's voting was to choose parliamentary candidates for <ORGANIZATION> Kenya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> of President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> arap </PERSON> <PERSON> Moi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s only legal political party. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Matere </PERSON> <PERSON> Keriri </PERSON>, who was assistant transport minister but failed in his nomination bid, called the vote `` an absolute sham, a fraud not an election.'' <PERSON> Keriri </PERSON> and a few other losing candidates claimed they or their agents were arrested and harassed by partisan officials the night before the Monday vote and that several agents were barred from polling stations. One man identified as a Keriri supporter died and two other people were hospitalized in the northern <LOCATION> Kirinyaga </LOCATION> district, where violence was used to keep some people from voting, newspapers reported. The elections marked the party's first test of the new system and a much-criticized regulation that allows nominees with more than 70 percent of the vote to enter Parliament unopposed. At least 30 candidates received more than 70 percent. Church leaders, lawyers and a few politicians have called the line-forming system as intimidating and said the 70-percent rule disenfranchizes non-party members. Under the new system, voters lined up behind candidates and officials took a head count. Government officials contend the new system will prevent corruption and give the party rank and file a greater voice. Candidates previously were chosen by the party chairman, secretary-general and treasurer. Preliminary results indicated poor turnouts in many constituencies. The Standard, an independent <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> newspaper, reported hundreds of eligible voters milled outside some voting locations and only a few lined up to vote. `` It appeared more people came as spectators than as voters,'' it said. Anglican Bishop <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gitari </PERSON> accused election officials of trying to rig the ballots. He said the election official at one polling station refused to count heads when more people lined up behind <PERSON> Keriri </PERSON> than behind his opponent. Official tallies were expected later this week in the week. Presidential nominations are due Saturday but no-one is expected to challenge <PERSON> Moi </PERSON>. He has held the office since the death of the first president, <PERSON> Jomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyatta </PERSON>, a decade ago.

<TEXT>
 A former county assistant judge who was the focus of misconduct charges against three state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices has been convicted of lying under oath. A <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury found former <LOCATION> Chittenden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Assistant Judge <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheel </PERSON> guilty late Monday after more than six hours of deliberations, said court spokeswoman <PERSON> Harriett </PERSON> <PERSON> Eitapence </PERSON>. An attorney for Wheel, found guilty of three counts of lying under oath, said he would try to have the verdict set aside. Wheel, 55, was charged in October 1986 for her actions during an inquest earlier that year into allegations that she had padded her paycheck. The prosecution maintained she lied when asked if she had altered court files to indicate that she was sitting in court on days she actually was elsewhere. Judges are paid for time spent hearing cases. Assistant judges in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> are elected lay people, while regular judges are lawyers appointed by the governor. Wheel was a high school English teacher until her election in 1974 and had long been active in Democratic politics. Lay judges, who make up the state's superior court system, hear mostly civil cases, although before court reorganization several years ago they also often heard criminal cases. The charges against Wheel, who was defeated in a September 1986 election, rocked the state's judiciary because of her association with three <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices. Misconduct charges were filed in January 1987 by the <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> against Wheel, former <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, and Justice <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, accusing them of using their influence to help Wheel while she was under investgation by the attorney general's office in the paycheck-padding case. <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> died last year, and charges against <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> were dropped. Wheel and <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> await proceedings before the conduct board. The board is slated to take up 12 counts against <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> on March 7. One of the misconduct counts alleges that <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> berated an employee of the <ORGANIZATION> Chittenden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> when she walked into a room and saw Wheel's arms around <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>. Another alleges that Wheel's friendship with <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> was so open that an employee of the court called <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> at home and warned him that unless he altered his behavior in front of Wheel it could do serious damage to his reputation. Another charge alleges that <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> talked improperly outside the courtroom with Wheel about a case that had been tried in her court and was being appealed before him at the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> level. During the trial, Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Suntag </PERSON> portrayed Wheel as someone who had been caught in a web of lies and deceit as she signed her name to the court folders to cover up the fact she had hardly sat in court on cases for a year. `` She lied under oath, and no amount of talking about lots of other things and no amount of changing stories ... can change that,'' <PERSON> Suntag </PERSON> told the jury. Wheel's attorney, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, said he would move to have Monday's verdict set aside on grounds that the evidence did not support a guilty finding. During the trial, which began Jan. 25, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> had argued that Wheel was the victim of a vendetta by court personnel. Wheel faces a maximum penalty of 15 years in jail and a $ 10,000 fine for each of the three counts. No sentencing date had been set.

 An Israeli tank was attacked while on patrol in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers were killed and two wounded, the military command announced Tuesday. Lebanese security sources said earlier Tuesday that guerrillas using rocket-propelled grenades ambushed an Israeli armored patrol consisting of one tank and one armored personnel carrier near the south <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Braachit </LOCATION>, killing two soldiers and wounding others. The Israeli army announcement said the tank was hit by an explosive device at 6 p.m. Monday near <LOCATION> Braachit </LOCATION>, six miles north of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> border in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-designed security zone in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` The explosive device was activated and as a result of that, two soldiers were killed and two others suffered light wounds and were rescued,'' the brief announcement said. It said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers launched a search in the area. The announcement gave no details. The military command did not explain why the announcement was delayed for over 24 hours. The Israeli fatalities in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> were the first this year. `` Both vehicles were raked with rocket-propelled grenades that set off a chain of ammunition explosions in the tank. No one could have escaped alive from the burning tank,'' said one of the Lebanese sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said the guerrillas were either Shiite Moslem fundamentalists or pro-Syrian leftists.

 ST-JEAN, <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Bissonnette </PERSON>, who was dismissed from the federal <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> after news reports linked him to a questionable land deal, was acquitted Tuesday of four charges of fraud, breach of trust and conspiracy. <PERSON> Normand </PERSON> <PERSON> Ouellette </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bissonnette </PERSON>'s close friend and political associate, was convicted of one count of fraud but acquitted of one charge of breach of trust, one count of conspiracy to commit fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit breach of trust. Charges were filed after a series of sales that tripled the price of a piece of land in St-Jean from $ 800,000 to $ 2.98 million in 11 days of January 1986. The Canadian dollar is worth about 79 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oerlikon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> contracted to buy the land 13 weeks before the federal government awarded it a $ 600 million contract to build <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s low-level air defense system. Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> fired <PERSON> Bissonnette </PERSON>, 42, of St-Jean a day after reports of the land sales were made public last year. He had been junior transport minister. In <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s office released a statement saying `` the prime minister is very pleased that Mr. <PERSON> Bissonnette </PERSON> has been fully exonerated by a jury of his peers.'' The statement said nothing about <PERSON> Bissonnette </PERSON>'s chances of getting back into the Cabinet. The jury was told to decide whether steps taken by <PERSON> Ouellette </PERSON> that drove up the price were `` objectively dishonest,'' and whether <PERSON> Bissonnette </PERSON> helped him. Judge <PERSON> Jean-Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boilard </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Quebec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> also instructed the jury to determine whether <PERSON> Bissonnette </PERSON> knew of methods used by <PERSON> Ouellette </PERSON>, who managed his blind trust. Prosecutors alleged that <PERSON> Bissonnette </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ouellette </PERSON> used privileged information to profit illegally from the sale. <PERSON> Bissonnette </PERSON> denied in court that half the profit from the final transaction, in which <PERSON> Ouellette </PERSON> was involved, wound up in the bank accounts of himself and his wife. <PERSON> Bissonnette </PERSON> smiled slightly as the verdict was read. He later crossed the room, patted <PERSON> Ouellette </PERSON> on the back and wished him luck. <PERSON> Bissonnette </PERSON>, a self-made millionaire, was known as the `` Chicken King'' of Quebec because one of his companies supplied much of the barbecued chicken sold in restaurants in the province. Outside the courthouse, he shook hands with several jurors. He thanked <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> for supporting him over the past 13 months and said he would leave any decision about his political future up to the prime minister.

 The government is reviewing plans for comprehensive screening of blood supplies for AIDS, since some blood banks were testing only 8 percent of their supplies, the <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nigeria </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday. Dr. <PERSON> Etim </PERSON> <PERSON> Essien </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adivsory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on AIDS, said testing in <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>'s nine blood banks ranged from 8 to 85 percent of supplies. <PERSON> Essien </PERSON> said the incidence of AIDS in <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> was small, but plans for a comprehensive screening program were under review to guard against the spread of the disease through blood transfusions. <PERSON> Essien </PERSON> said there were 20 known cases of AIDS in <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s most populous nation with more than 105 million people, and the chances of getting the disease through blood transfusion were small. He gave no details about the screening program or say when it would be implemented. <PERSON> Essien </PERSON>'s comments followed the launching of a $ 1 million national AIDS education program. Meanwhile, a <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> newspaper confirmed the death Friday of the country's 12th AIDS victim, a Gambian national living in <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>. Professor <PERSON> Idris </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, also speaking at the launching of the new AIDS program, said <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>'s AIDS victims were mostly low-income farmers who patronized prostitutes. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a disease in which a virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers. AIDS is most often transmitted through sexual contact. Other means of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood or blood products, and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles or syringes by drug abusers. AIDS can also be passed from mother to child at or before birth.

 A 28-year-old transient was being held Tuesday in lieu of $ 1 million bond, accused of shooting two plainclothes policemen and then barricading himself with hostages in an office building. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was charged with two counts of attempted capital murder in the Monday night shooting. Authorities alleged that <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a familiar figure to officers patrolling downtown, scuffled with police who confronted him, got an officer's gun and opened fire. One of the captives, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Renaud </PERSON>, said the gunman seemed disoriented and contended he was being framed by police. `` My understanding is he had some mental problems and it's your typical downtown problem that we've been faced with,'' City Manager <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said Monday night. Meanwhile, Officer <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorrell </PERSON>, 33, a two-year veteran, was in critical condition at <ORGANIZATION> Brooke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> after more than 13 hours of surgery on a head wound, said hospital spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. Officer <PERSON> Onofre </PERSON> <PERSON> Serna </PERSON>, 26, was in good condition at <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> with a wound to his left shoulder, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Inez </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisazadeh </PERSON>. According to police spokesman Sgt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Buske </PERSON>, the two officers had stopped the man and a female companion who appeared to be intoxicated. `` A struggle ensued,'' <PERSON> Buske </PERSON> said. `` One of the officers lost his weapon. -LRB- The suspect -RRB- picked up the weapon and several shots were fired.'' The man took a gun, a badge and a police radio and fled into a <LOCATION> Travis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaza </LOCATION> building, where he took two hostages. He released them and went to a third-floor office, where he took three hostages. <PERSON> Renaud </PERSON>, an accountant who was working late with others at <ORGANIZATION> Deloitte </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Haskins </PERSON> and Sells, said he at first thought the gunman was joking, then decided to listen to the man to calm him down. `` He seemed disoriented at first, despondent, that he had gotten framed,'' <PERSON> Renaud </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` He said he was n't there to hurt us. He said he just needed a place to hide out for the night.'' After a few minutes, he said, he and the man got a soft drink to cool off. `` Right after he got his <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>, I decided I needed a drink desperately and poured a little <ORGANIZATION> Seagram </ORGANIZATION>'s Seven in my <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> so I could think,'' <PERSON> Renaud </PERSON> said. `` I got interrupted quite a few times by the telephone, but I never really tried to say anything that would upset him.'' <PERSON> Renaud </PERSON> and his two co-workers escaped when the gunman walked into another area to take a sixth hostage, <PERSON> Buske </PERSON> said. He surrendered an hour later. The <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antonio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express-News </ORGANIZATION> talked to the man by telephone Monday night. He told the newspaper he was just walking when he was grabbed by a man with a gun and a badge. `` The gun just went off ... I did n't mess with nobody,'' he said. <PERSON> Gorrell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Serna </PERSON> were part of a downtown foot patrol aimed at deterring street crime. Last month, a mentally ill homeless man shot and killed a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police officer in a downtown parking lot.

 Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> fought his <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential rivals in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> primary and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> caucuses Tuesday as Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> all but conceded defeat in advance. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> dueled <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and the rest of the pack for fresh momentum in the Democratic race. The two states were billed as the gateway to Super Tuesday _ a <LOCATION> Midwestern </LOCATION> opportunity to demonstrate electoral strength before the March 8 festival of delegate-rich primaries and caucuses, mostly in Southern and border states. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was rated the heavy favorite in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> Republican primary as he bid to rebound from last week's drubbing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. As the polls were closing, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> projected that <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> would win the Republican primary in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> in a tight race for second place in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> race. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> also projected <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> as the winner in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>.. The <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator also campaigned hard in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> dreamed of an upset and Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> made an all-out effort as well. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who finished third in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses earlier this month, made little effort in the two neighboring <LOCATION> Midwestern </LOCATION> states. He spent little money in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and withdrew television advertisements from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> stations. Democrat <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, fresh from a triumph in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary, aimed for a convincing win in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> as he bid to demonstrate that his candidacy has appeal outside <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucus winner <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also vied for support as they sought standing in the race before the primary and caucus calendar turned South. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> each hoped for a win in a heated <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> race. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> invested heavily in television advertising, as well, hoping for a strong showing outside his native South in advance of Super Tuesday. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who once said he would quit the race if he failed to score a victory in either state, stepped back from that standard late last week and vowed to stay in the race no matter where he finished. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, his comeback candidacy in tatters after poor finishes in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, campaigned hard in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. For <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> posed a financial test, as well. Each man finished with less than 10 percent of the vote in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, and a similar result in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> would deprive them of federal matching funds beginning in 30 days. A candidate can requalify by gaining 20 percent of the vote in a future primary. The states offered a bewildering array of delegate selection provisions. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vote was a preferential poll designed to serve as an advisory opinion to a statewide caucus on March 12 that will allocate 15 of the state's 19 delegates. But <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s Democrats began the selection of 78 of the state's 87 delegates to the party's nominating convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in July. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s Republican primary voters picked all 18 of the state's delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominating convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> in August. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s Republicans expressed their presidential preferences through a straw vote and selected delegates to begin the process of picking 31 national convention delegates.

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> plans to reopen its assembly plant here in May and rehire about 1,800 of the 3,700 workers who lost their jobs when it closed in November, a <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> official said Tuesday. Company officials were aiming for May 9 as a startup date, but the reopening could be delayed an additional week, said <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> Regional Manager <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nedrow </PERSON>. One shift would return to work, he said. `` We're hopeful ... we're going to have a second shift'' later in the year, depending on whether car sales pick up further, <PERSON> Nedrow </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. A formal announcement on the startup will be made Wednesday, he said. <PERSON> Nedrow </PERSON> spoke shortly after Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., said he had been told that <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> would reopen the plant May 9 A spokesman for <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said state officials also had been informed the plant would reopen. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> closed the plant Nov. 31, blaming sluggish sales of the midsized Chevrolet Celebrity and <ORGANIZATION> Oldsmobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cutlass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ciera </ORGANIZATION> assembled at <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION>. At the time, the company said it hoped to reopen the plant in the spring. Industry analysts had predicted such a move was unlikely because the plant is nearly 40 years old and projections call for a continued decline in sales of the models made there. Attempts to reach officials of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> 422 for comment were not immediately successful. Telephone calls to the union office were not answered. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, a presidential candidate, praised <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> in a statement issued by his office for keeping its pledge to reopen in the spring. `` But since this is only a partial reopening, I am still very concerned about the workers who are not returning to the jobs at the plant.'' `` I commend <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> for this decision,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` I will continue to work with <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> to resume full production as soon as possible.''

<HEAD>Senate Filibuster Over Campaign Spending Limits Bill</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Tops with 3 grafs to UPDATE with filibuster continuing,
picking up 2nd pvs, bgng: We've decided</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> launched a `` full-fledged filibuster'' Tuesday as Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> ordered 24-hour sessions to subdue <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> opposition to a Democratic campaign financing bill. The talking, broken by occasional roll calls, began about 2 p.m. and continued into the night. Appointments were canceled, schedules revised, senators began catching up on paperwork and cots were set up in rooms near the chamber. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, lacking the votes to prevent Republicans from stalling action on the legislation, threatened to keep the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in session indefinitely. `` We've decided we'll just go around-the-clock,'' the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Democrat said at midafternoon after <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and Democratic negotiators reported making no progress on the central question of spending limits. `` We're going to talk or we're going to vote,'' said <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, warning that foes of the campaign finance legislation would have to keep control of the floor to prevent a vote. Democrats and Republicans have been at loggerheads for nearly a year over a Democratic bill with 52 co-sponsors that would set up a system of voluntary spending limits for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> general election campaigns. The limit would be from $ 950,000 to $ 5.5 million, depending on a state's population. The bill's supporters say limits are needed to put a brake on the increasing cost of getting elected, up from an average of $ 600,000 in 1976 to $ 3 million in 1986. In larger states, growing numbers of candidates are spending more than $ 10 million to win a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat, with increasing amounts of campaign funds being supplied by special-interest political action committees. A candidate observing the voluntary limit would get campaign funds from the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> if the opponent exceeded the limit or an independent group spent large amounts of money against the candidate. Republicans, who have made opposition to limits a party issue, succeeded last year in preventing the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> from voting on the legislation, winning a record seven cloture votes during 22 days of floor time. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, even with the support of three of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s 46 Republicans, is believed to be five votes short of the 60 needed to cut off debate and force a vote on the bill. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is in a full-fledged filibuster,'' said <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, adding that he would no longer confine debate to daylight hours. `` There's no point in continuing the casual, gentlemanly, good-guy filibuster because it will just turn out like it did last year,'' he said. ... Let's have it on the floor where the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people can see it.'' Four Democrats and four Republicans have been negotiating since last week. They reported progress on some facets of the bill but not on spending limits, which Republicans say will discriminate against them in states with a heavy Democratic edge in registered votes. The chief negotiators said their positions on the key issue were solid. A limit on spending `` is something this side is not going to agree to,'' said <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>, R-Ky. `` That is not one of the negotiable items. His counterpart, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., was just as adamant: `` Any bill that does not limit campaign spending would not be real reform. <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said, however, that Democrats are willing to discuss higher spending limits in states where their party enjoys a big advantage in registration or historically has dominated congressional elections. There was no public response from <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>, who said Republicans were willing to discuss compromise on another Democratic demand: putting a ceiling on how much money a candidate can get from political action committees. <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> and <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> said negotiators had neared informal agreement on other issues, including controling how much personal money a millionare can put into his or her campaign; requiring broadcasters to charge rock-bottom rates for political ads; better disclosure of money going to political parties; and getting controls on so-called `` soft money,'' which includes groups like labor unions supplying people to help candidates with canvassing and phone banks.

 Democrats who chose a candidate in the final days of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> primary race went strongly Tuesday for Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, who employed aggressive television advertising in his winning campaign. Among the Republicans, network exit polls said, conservative voters helped <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> challenge Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for second place, while Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> won with broad support. A third of the Democratic voters told <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> they made up their minds in the last three days of the race, and 45 percent of them backed <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, compared to 23 percent for <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> had trumpeted a key endorsement and attacked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in television advertising. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who finished second, split the liberal vote. But <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> won the moderate and conservative Democrats, won the male vote while splitting the female vote with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, and won among the less wealthy and the less educated, again splitting the others with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the polls suggested. Surprisingly, the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll found that a plurality of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> Democrats, 46 percent, said they believed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> eventualy will win the presidential nomination, even though not all voted for him. On the Republican side, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s identification with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> failed to help his cause, the same problem <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> suffered in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses Feb. 8, the polls indicated. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> finished third in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> won the Republican primary, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> were locked in a race that was too close to call and Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> was a distant fourth. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> won the Democratic race, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was running second and the remaining candidates were tightly bunched well back. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaigned determinedly in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> steered clear of the state. The exit polls indicated that <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> won strongly in nearly all categories; ABC News, for example, found that <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> won more than seven in 10 liberals and moderates and four in 10 conservatives. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was second among conservatives, with 27 percent in <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s poll, according to network poll analyst <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> was well back, with 8 percent of conservatives. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, a former television evangelist, won support from 51 percent of evangelical Christians, who made up about a fifth of the Republican electorate. Republicans who support President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> helped <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> win the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary. But in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> nearly half of the Republicans who favor <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ 56 percent of the total _ went for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> found. About a quarter each backed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. Among the losing Democrats, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> found that former Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, who won the state in his 1984 bid for the nomination, was viewed unfavorably this year by twice as many <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakotans </LOCATION> as viewed him favorably. Roughly 60 percent said they were not pleased that <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> re-entered the race after withdrawing last summer amid questions about his marital fidelity. The <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> survey had a margin of sample error of 4 percent; <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s was 5 percent and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s was 3 percent The networks did not poll in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, which held precinct caucuses Tuesday rather than primaries.

 Few people will remember the full name of what was, until recently, the fourth largest law firm in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But few who watched its rise to glory will soon forget the spectacular fall of <PERSON> Finley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kumble </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Heine </PERSON>, <PERSON> Underberg </PERSON>, <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Myerson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>. As recently as last summer, <PERSON> Finley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kumble </PERSON> was a growing, thriving concern, or so it seemed _ 700 of the country's hottest lawyers chasing after business with an aggressiveness and a flamboyance that shook up the profession. Its partners included three former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators, a one-time <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> governor and an ex-mayor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. In addition to lavish headquarters on <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, it had major branches in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and smaller offices throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and abroad. Its clients included <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> and real estate developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. By the end of the year, <PERSON> Finley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kumble </PERSON> was gone _ `` vaporized,'' says founder <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumble </PERSON> _ and its lawyers were hiring lawyers for the battle over what remained: an $ 83 million debt. `` The fabric of a law firm is a very delicate thing,'' <PERSON> Kumble </PERSON> says now. `` If you tear it, it can unravel very quickly. And that is what happened in this case.'' Ambition, jealousy and greed were the instruments of destruction at <LOCATION> Finley </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kumble </PERSON>, where top partners waged internal warfare and borrowed money to pay their own salaries, which were among the highest in the profession. As the yarn unraveled publicly in the legal press last fall, the profession looked on with morbid fascination tinged with glee and a bit of introspection. <PERSON> Finley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kumble </PERSON> was never popular among other lawyers and judges. It was too big, too brash, too noisy and did n't play by the old rules. It lacked gentility. But for all its excesses, the firm embodied many of the changes that have been sweeping the legal profession for the last two decades. Law firms once operated like exclusive, private clubs. Now, large firms are absorbing smaller ones. Partners, who once considered a change in firms to be tantamount to divorce, are doing what many married couples have done in recent years _ finding new partners. Firms that 20 years ago were unlikely to have even one branch office outside their home city are now spreading around the globe. <PERSON> Finley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kumble </PERSON> was among the biggest of the national superfirms. It did n't grow `` organically,'' like the old establishment firms; when it wanted new partners, it went out and bought them. In many respects, <PERSON> Finley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kumble </PERSON> operated more like the multinational corporations it served than the law firms it challenged. `` I do think it's a harbinger of sorts,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Abel </PERSON>, a professor of law at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> who is studying the development of the legal profession. `` Certainly many lawyers are viewing it as a cautionary tale, and a worrisome one.'' <PERSON> Finley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kumble </PERSON> was founded in 1968 by eight <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> lawyers led by <PERSON> Kumble </PERSON>, a graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> who was 35 years old at the time. <PERSON> Kumble </PERSON> says he had no grand plan _ he just wanted to practice law. The firm grew gradually in its first decade. By 1978, it had 70 lawyers, all still in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. They were doing very well. `` Basically, the firm grew because we ... expanded to meet the needs of our clients,'' says <PERSON> Kumble </PERSON>. `` We did n't set out to grow; we set out to build a law practice.'' Things began to change in 1978. Recognizing the growing importance of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> as a financial and corporate center, <PERSON> Finley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kumble </PERSON> took on <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> as its first <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> partner and allowed him to begin building the firm's first branch office in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. As it grew, the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> office began to challenge the dominance of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In 1983, in a bitter power struggle, <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> persuaded management to let him become co-managing partner along with <PERSON> Kumble </PERSON>. By then, <PERSON> Finley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kumble </PERSON> had 283 lawyers, only 100 of them in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. There were 86 lawyers in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, 63 in a new <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office, 26 in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and eight in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. The firm was on the move. In the next four years, <PERSON> Finley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kumble </PERSON> would more than double in size and open new offices in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and Ft.. <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> It would recruit former Sens. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Tydings </PERSON> to join former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> and former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> Sr. It would become one of the most high-profile firms in the country, with lawyers and legal publications constantly discussing its aggressive tactics and its philosophy of `` meritocracy,'' in which lawyers were said to be rewarded according to the business they generated, not the years they served. But the battle for control of the firm continued. First it was <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>; after he left in 1986, it was a new partner, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, who struggled with <PERSON> Kumble </PERSON>. The showdown came in February 1987. At a management committee meeting in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, the firm's officers voted to strip <PERSON> Kumble </PERSON> of power, which fell to <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office. The expansion continued, but through that spring and summer, unsettling reports made the rounds among lower-level partners. According to these partners, the rumors said the firm was in debt _ deeply in debt. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> partner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fass </PERSON> says the bottom line for him was the discovery, just a few months after he joined the firm in January 1987, that more than half the firm's profits were borrowed. `` The ship was already underwater when I got there, but I did n't know about it,'' <PERSON> Fass </PERSON> said `` A lot of people who had been there for a number of years had no inkling what was going on.'' What was going on, many partners later charged, was that the managing partners had hidden the borrowing by creating a separate corporation that took out bank loans to buy up the firm's accounts receivable _ the unpaid bills of clients. This money was then used to pay the generous salaries of the firm's superstar lawyers, many of them lured in the firm's final year of furious expansion. <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> and Long were said to have been offered $ 800,000 a year.

 In September, the borrowing scheme was divulged publicly in an extraordinary front-page article in The American Lawyer magazine by editor <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Brill </PERSON>. It was titled, `` Bye, Bye, <PERSON> Finley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kumble </PERSON>,'' and it was prophetic. `` It was devastating,'' said one <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> partner, who, like many people interviewed for this article would speak only on condition of anonymity. `` That article, I think, was really the beginning of the end.'' In it, <PERSON> Brill </PERSON> not only laid bare <PERSON> Finley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kumble </PERSON>'s financial morass in excruciating detail, he also castigated the firm for what he viewed as a misplaced sense of priorities. `` It has become a place,'' wrote <PERSON> Brill </PERSON>, `` where the only corporate culture is money, where things like pro bono -LRB- charitable legal work -RRB- or collegiality are sissy stuff _ which means that when the money dries up, even temporarily, there's no other glue there, no shared values, to hold the place together.'' Toward the end of the summer, lawyers were leaving <PERSON> Finley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kumble </PERSON> in growing numbers. After <PERSON> Brill </PERSON>'s article, the stream turned to a torrent. By the beginning of December, branches were closing and it became apparent that the firm could not survive. On Dec. 21, at a sparsely attended meeting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the remaining partners voted to disband as of Jan. 4. A four-member liquidation committee is now sorting the firm's accounts, trying to determine how its assets stack up against the $ 83 million debt One <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> partner estimates that as much as $ 60 million can be squeezed out of the firm's real estate, accounts receivable and other assets. But he said the process could take years. `` I'm sure that five years from now there will still be some quivering in the corpse,'' he said. Meanwhile, two lawsuits have been filed by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> partners <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborn </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellsworth </PERSON>, and others are expected. <PERSON> Osborn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ellsworth </PERSON> allege that they were misled about the financial health of the firm and should not be responsible for repaying the debt. Four banks have sued, charging that all partners are responsible and that some assets have been hidden. Some partners who have signed individual settlements with the banks were not named in the suit, and more such settlements are likely. What went wrong at <LOCATION> Finley </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kumble </PERSON>? The consensus is that the firm grew too far, too fast, exercising questionable business judgment along the way. Its level of borrowing was `` almost unheard of'' among law firms, according to <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, chairman of an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> committee on law office management and president of <ORGANIZATION> Hildebrandt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest legal management consulting firm. `` In fact, until recently, law firms did n't borrow, period,'' <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kumble </PERSON> counters that the firm's loans were no different from those employed by many corporations. `` It was a big business, and it borrowed like big businesses do,'' he said. The problem, he said, was that when adversity began driving partners away from the firm, those remaining could n't support the debt. And as they realized that, they left too. And what of <PERSON> Brill </PERSON>'s contention that <PERSON> Finley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kumble </PERSON> lacked the loyalty, friendship and shared goals that hold law firms together, that it was a place to do business, nothing more? `` I've had more conversations with other people in two weeks than I had in 11 months at <LOCATION> Finley </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kumble </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Fass </PERSON>, now at another <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> firm. `` There, nobody cared what you did so long as you brought in money.'' Still, <PERSON> Finley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kumble </PERSON>'s basic business strategy _ national growth, corporate-style aggressiveness _ was far from unique. Ten years ago, only two law firms in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had more than seven branches, according to <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Abel </PERSON>. In 1987, there were 13 such firms. Ten years ago, no firm had more than 300 lawyers. In 1987, there were 38. <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> said the growth has been disproportionate among the lowest-paid attorneys, the associates, whose fees help pad the profits of increasingly wealthy partners. Others say simply that the growth has been triggered by a new intensity in competition that has forced firms to reach out for new business. `` It's gotten to be a very tough, competitive marketplace,'' <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kumble </PERSON>, who is now chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Lincolnshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, a firm that arranges and finances leveraged buyouts, prided himself as a seer of the legal profession, often to the irritation of his competitors. He is giving no ground now. `` I think a lot of firms are emulating what <PERSON> Finley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kumble </PERSON> did, in terms of being a national law firm, in terms of lateral recruitment -LRB- of partners -RRB-, in terms of expansion, and I think that will continue,'' he said. `` The problem we had is that our management committee became very politicized. ... I do n't think the concept was flawed. I think the combination of people we had did n't work cohesively. It was n't the concept _ it was the people.

<TEXT>
 Despite her opposition to apartheid, despite her work as a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> delegate, despite her award-winning efforts for human rights, <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Makeba </PERSON> insists she is an artist _ not a politician. It was as an artist that the empress of African song first spoke out against the system of discrimination in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, testifying before the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Apartheid in 1963. In retaliation, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> banned her records. `` Afterward, I tell the press, ` I am not a politician or a diplomat,''' <PERSON> Makeba </PERSON> writes in her recently published autobiography `` Makeba: My Story,'' written with <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION>, $ 18.95 -RRB-. `` I am just a singer, I say. But in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, when the authorities learn of my testimony, I become something else: a criminal.'' `` Makeba: My Story,'' recounts some of the joy and sadness in the life of one of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s most acclaimed singers, who has been in exile from her native country since 1959. She decided to write her autobiography five years ago. `` I never really wanted to write a book. Besides, I do n't know how to write.'' However, <PERSON> Makeba </PERSON> said, friends convinced her of the book's importance; she was `` the first artist to leave the country and make some type of impact on the world'' while not forgetting the problems that exist in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> `` They said that if anything should happen to me, others could write whatever they wanted without my being able to say whether it's true or false,'' she said. `` It was so hard. Every time I read it, I just cry. This morning I was looking at the book. ... I looked at it for maybe for 10 minutes and I was crying.'' The book coincides with the release of `` Sangoma,'' the singer's first American album since the late 1960s It is a collection of 19 African songs, sung in three languages. The songs were taught to <PERSON> Makeba </PERSON> by her mother, who was a Sangoma, the South African term for a healer in close communication with ancestral spirits. `` ` Sangoma' is the most personal record I've made,'' <PERSON> Makeba </PERSON> said. `` I like the songs because every time I sing them I think about my mother because she sung them.'' Born in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> on March 4, 1932, with the Xhosa tribal name Zensile, <PERSON> Makeba </PERSON> has survived bitter personal and career setbacks. When she was just 18 days old, she went to jail for six months with her mother, who had illegally brewed homemade beer to support the family. Later, after her mother was released, the family moved to <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, where they endured the hardship of apartheid. At a young age, she found joy in singing. Some of the songs protested her country's white minority regime: The songs were a way she and others could demonstrate their defiance in school and church choruses. <PERSON> Makeba </PERSON> started her professional career in 1952. She was chosen as the female vocalist for one of the country's top bands, the <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>. In 1955 she accepted a small role in the documentary, `` Come Back Africa,'' based on the life of a murdered black boxer. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Belafonte </PERSON> spotted her in the film, helped her to obtain a visa and then boosted her career when she arrived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1959. She writes in her book that <PERSON> Belafonte </PERSON> _ or `` Big Brother,'' as she calls him _ gave her this advice: `` You must always be careful how you conduct yourself on stage and off, because some day you will have a chance to speak on behalf of your people.'' With her `` click'' singing and deep but lilting voice, <PERSON> Makeba </PERSON> created a sensation in her first American TV appearances and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> club dates, and she was received by the late Ethiopian Emperor <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Selassie </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, the late President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and other world leaders. In 1960, her mother died and she wished to return home to visit her grave and see relatives. She went to the South African consulate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The man at the desk takes my passport. He does not speak to me, but to himself when he says, ` <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Makeba </PERSON>,' as if he was expecting this moment,'' she writes. `` He takes a rubber stamp and slams it down on my passport. Then he walks away. I pick up my passport. It is stamped ` INVALID.''' She has not been allowed to return to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> since. Her troubles were not limited to her native land. She has been married five times, including once to South African trumpet player <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Maskela </PERSON>, but her career in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was most affected by her marriage to black activist <PERSON> Stokely </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON>. `` I never had any problems with the officials in this country, it's just that when I married <PERSON> Stokely </PERSON> ... many concerts that were booked for me were canceled _ I guess because some people took my marriage so personally,'' she said. `` And when that happened I had a tour planned in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, so I just packed up and went to some of my friends in <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>.'' Her friendship with <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>'s president, <PERSON> Sequo </PERSON> <PERSON> Toure </PERSON>, led to her work as a Guinean delegate to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Are Humans Fundamentally Aggressive?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In 1972, <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Strum </PERSON> found herself alone with a troop of baboons among the spare, scattered acacia trees on the plains of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, a jacket knotted around her waist and a clipboard in her hand. A graduate student in anthropology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Strum </PERSON> had been dispatched to <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> to observe the baboons. She knew little about them. And she knew less about survival in the African wilderness. `` It was only total ignorance of what I was getting into that gave me the courage to go,'' she said recently in an interview. <PERSON> Strum </PERSON> was supposed to stay in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> for 18 months, just long enough to collect the data she would need to write a Ph.D. thesis. Instead, she made <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> her home. By 1976, her studies had grown into the Gilgil Baboon Project. She now employs six full-time researchers. <PERSON> Strum </PERSON> has written a lively, personal account of the project in `` Almost Human'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Random </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, $ 22.50 -RRB-. She was in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to promote the book, which synthesizes the ideas she has developed during 15,000 hours of watching baboons in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> during the past 15 years. In `` Almost Human,'' she compares the behavior of the olive baboon, Papio anubis, to the behavior of <PERSON> Homo </PERSON> sapiens. Her studies, vividly recounted in the book, challenge the accepted wisdom that baboons are brute, aggressive beasts. In so doing, the studies have changed her thinking about human nature. `` If baboons were aggressive, then the killer ape was where we started from,'' she said. Early baboon studies formed part of the underpinning for the idea widely popularized in the 1960s by the writer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ardrey </PERSON> that a `` killer ape'' lurks inside each of us. Humans are fundamentally aggressive, <PERSON> Ardrey </PERSON> wrote in `` African Genesis,'' and nothing we do can change that; we can only control it. That is not what <PERSON> Strum </PERSON> found, however. She draws an engaging picture of baboons as sophisticated creatures who prefer negotiation and persuasion to aggression. The old picture was of a society in which males held all power and used force to attain dominance. Strum found that males were transients and that they did not arrange themselves in a hierarchy with dominant males on top. She found that females were the stable core of baboon troops, and were ranked in a dominance hierarchy. Females _ not males _ were the linchpins of baboon society. They did not, however, exert their dominance over the males. `` It turns out to be a society where there is a complementarity of roles,'' <PERSON> Strum </PERSON> said. `` Even if you have dominance and aggression in the traditional sense, it does n't explain everything.'' No one suggests that the hominids, or human-like creatures, that gave rise to humans resembled baboons. But, said <PERSON> Strum </PERSON>, if baboons had developed to the point where they no longer relied on naked aggression, then humanity's early ancestors probably did too. `` It's impossible for me to believe that the early hominids were less sophisticated than baboons,'' she said. Thus our early ancestors may have abandoned aggressive social practices long ago. <PERSON> Strum </PERSON> grew up in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, and she had no plans to become an anthropologist when she left home in 1965 for the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>. But the turmoil of those years in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> made a mark on her. `` As I lived through the Free Speech movement and the Vietnam War protests, I found myself confronting, over and over, questions about human nature, about what was innate and impossible to modify and what was flexible and worth changing,'' she writes. She drifted in and out of the psychology and sociology departments before fixing on anthropology. She fell under the spell of <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON>, a leading American anthropologist who had done some of the first observations of baboons in the 1950s and'60s. It was <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON> who said: `` Go out and watch baboons.'' That's what she did for six years, keeping careful records of her observations. In June 1978, at a conference on baboon behavior organized by <PERSON> Strum </PERSON>, she presented her findings to her colleagues. `` The 10 worst days of my life followed,'' she writes. Other baboon watchers at the conference could n't accept her conclusions, or her methods. When she arrived in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, she decided to follow baboons on foot, rather than watching from a van, as her predecessors had done. That was partly what enabled her to learn so much about baboon society. `` Rival baboon watchers criticized me,'' she writes. `` I was ` interfering,' ruining the baboons!'' It took time, but <PERSON> Strum </PERSON> overcame her disillusionment with her colleagues and won many of them over. As that crisis resolved, however, she faced a crisis of a different sort in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>: The baboons she had come to know so intimately were in danger; the undeveloped ranch on which they had been allowed to roam had been sold, and it was being divided into 5-acre and 10-acre parcels. The baboons' wilderness would soon be farmland. <PERSON> Strum </PERSON> and her colleagues made preparations to do the unthinkable _ to relocate the baboons to another wilderness area. No one had ever attempted to move a group of non-human primates from one wilderness area to another. The search for a new location proved difficult, but at the last minute a site was found. The animals were difficult to capture. They were being moved to an area where they would have to learn to eat new foods. Would they survive? They would. `` It's been a great success,'' <PERSON> Strum </PERSON> said. The animals adapted well, and with <PERSON> Strum </PERSON>'s help, survived a dry period shortly after arriving at their new home. The success of the move has made translocation an option for conservationists, she said. `` Unwittingly, the baboons had given me much over the years, personally and scientifically,'' she writes. `` Now I had been able to reciprocate by giving them a chance for a better future.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Tom Wopat Battling ``Good Ole Boy'' Image</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former `` Dukes of Hazzard'' star <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Wopat </PERSON> is battling his spirited `` good ole boy'' image with love songs and a new TV show about modern family issues. <PERSON> Wopat </PERSON> is starring in the new <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION> drama, `` Blue Skies,'' and is maintaining a singing career with country music-oriented songs that have a more romantic feel than driving souped-up cars as the adventurous <PERSON> Luke </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>. `` Blue Skies'' is scheduled to begin this spring and the action involves coping with contemporary issues such as aging and alcoholism rather than rural escapades with his blond buddy <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>. `` It was a golden opportunity to be involved with fine persons and escape the ` good ole boy' stereotype,'' the 36-year-old <PERSON> Wopat </PERSON> said. `` I'm a totally different character. In ` Dukes,' everything was fantasy. In ` Blue Skies,' it's straightforward and as near to life as possible. `` I feel it's the type of show the public is looking for as shown by the success of ` Our House,''' he said. `` It's about three generations of family and the problems of the parents and their families.'' <PERSON> Wopat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, and their high powered car, the General <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, co-starred in `` Dukes of Hazzard'' for seven seasons beginning in 1978. Since then, both have gone on to country music careers and remained in acting. He and <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> just reunited in a holiday special, `` Christmas Comes to <LOCATION> Willow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>,'' which did well in the ratings. He sees <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> six to 10 times a year. `` I love him dearly,'' he said. `` He's like a brother. We shared so much and we were in so many scenes together. We genuinely liked each other and had the same interests. `` We decided from the beginning it was going to be fun and we'd enjoy it and I think this came across on the screen It's not common to have two leading men who got along as we did.'' Looking back on the highly rated `` <PERSON> Dukes </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Wopat </PERSON> said it was popular because it was different. `` Until then, urban half-hour comedies were on. We were a new rural show that was action oriented with some violence and exciting stunts. It was a calculated approach: a dark-haired boy, a light-haired boy, a mean old man, a nice old man, a comical old man, a pretty girl. `` It was pure entertainment. Kids could watch it with older people. There was no cussing and no sex except for -LRB- <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Bach </PERSON>'s -RRB- legs. There was a little moral message once in a while and it was oriented to family, not like ` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>' or ` Dynasty.' `` There were imitators, but we outlasted them all. No show will ever be seen again like it. The cost is too high.'' <PERSON> Wopat </PERSON>, who directed some episodes of `` <PERSON> Dukes </PERSON>,'' is selecting songs now for his second album. The first was `` Tom Wopat: A Little Bit Closer.'' A cut from the album, `` A Little Bit Closer,'' is the current release and has zipped up the country music charts. Two previous songs have reached the Top 20 on the charts: `` The Rock and Roll of Love'' and `` <PERSON> Susannah </PERSON>.'' He and his band, <LOCATION> Southwind </LOCATION>, do four to eight shows a month. Since `` <PERSON> Dukes </PERSON>,'' he has performed in two stage musicals, `` Carousel'' in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and off-Broadway in `` Olympus on My Mind.'' He's not done quite as well musically as <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, who's had No. 1 country music songs such as `` I've Been Around Enough to Know,'' `` What's a Memory Like You -LRB- Doing in a Love Like This -RRB-'' and `` Country Girls.'' `` It's been a long and frustrating process except when you have a passion for it,'' <PERSON> Wopat </PERSON> said about his music career. `` We're looking for a song to make a big difference _ that big hit that changes everything `` I'm still in the process of making believers out there in my commitment to country music. I think I can broaden the base of country music because of my visibility on TV. I'm optimistic about my future in country music. I think I'll be here for a long time.'' <PERSON> Wopat </PERSON>, who was raised on a small dairy farm in <LOCATION> Lodi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, says he watches very little television these days, mostly `` Cheers'' and reruns of `` The <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> Show.'' He has n't seen reruns of `` Dukes of Hazzard'' for a long time. `` I have them all on tape. I got one out a while ago and looked at how I directed it.'

 `` Serious Swingers'' -LRB- Fantasy -RRB- _ Bud Shank and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> Halfway through this record you swear you've heard this music somewhere before. You have if you listen to Side 1. The most noteworthy thing about this album is that it marks only the second time these two longtime studio musicians have recorded together. The first time was in 1954. However, the title is `` Serious Swingers,'' and this album does n't pretend to be any more than a good time _ incidental music for a Saturday night. In the jungle of over-produced pop jazz and fusion albums, there is a place for people who want to swing, to plow straight ahead in familar fields. Yet, this record somehow leaves an empty feeling. All the chops are just right, the solos just free enough that you know they were n't charted, the mix of ballad and swing ever so correct. A solid rythym section drives <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>' tenor sax and <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Shank </PERSON>'s alto. But the bottom line is this material has been done before and better by many. If you want the real thing instead of an homage, check out early <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> or Thelonious Monk or <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mingus </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Strike Threats, Labor Bitterness at Pan Am, Northwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Two of the nation's biggest and best-known airlines are facing strike threats over wages, benefits and concessions that reflect growing hostility between labor and management in the intensely competitive deregulated industry. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the union representing 4,500 ground employees in 14 cities remained deadlocked Monday following the breakup of their talks. Union leaders in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> threatened to call a strike at any time and vowed `` guerrilla war'' tactics that included losing passenger bags and canceling reservations. At the same time in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, flight attendants at <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> voted by a 94.4 percent majority to strike this weekend if a contract dispute over wages and benefits is not resolved. `` The strike authorization of 94.4 percent refects the deplorable state of labor relations at <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Musto </PERSON>, spokesman for the Teamsters Local 2747 representing 6,500 Northwest attendants. Officials at both airlines said managers would replace strikers in the event of walkouts and predicted minimal disruption. But the threat of a labor rebellion at <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> already appeared to be discouraging potential passengers. `` It's a very bad situation for everybody,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> DMS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> in midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. `` Some people are shying away -LRB- from <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flights -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> said his agency has been using double bookings as an insurance technique for customers booked on <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flights. For passengers taking <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> airport to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on Monday night, for example, he also booked them on flights offered by other airlines to the same destinations. The union threats against <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> came against a background of staggering losses for the eighth-largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline, which once dominated overseas travel but has been struggling over the past several years because of high costs and growing competition from other carriers, a partial result of airline deregulation a decade ago. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> management has demanded $ 35 million in concessions from the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>, who control ground workers at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> cities of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Prospects of a strike disruption at <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> were considered less severe, partly because flight attendants are the most easily replaced of all airline workers. But the carrier's machinists and pilots unions have not said whether they would honor a strike by flight attendants. Northwest and its major unions have been engrossed in talks on new contracts since the 1986 merger with <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, another result of deregulation, which made <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> the fifth-biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline. Many former Republic employees are paid less than their Northwest counterparts, a cause of friction between the airline and its unions. Northwest's latest proposal to the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> offers immediate elimination of pay gaps between former <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> and former Republic flight attendants. The union claims the company is compensating by reducing vacation pay and retirement benefits.

<HEAD>Judge Thwarts Ohio Takeover Law, Part of Federated's Anti-Campeau

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s new anti-takeover law, a key element of <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s strategy to thwart a hostile acquisition by Canadian developer <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, has been invalidated by a federal judge. The ruling Monday by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> was regarded as at least a temporary victory for <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, which has been pursuing the Cincinnati-based retailing giant with a takeover offer valued at $ 5.4 billion. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> granted <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s request for a preliminary injunction against the new statute, which was passed as an addition to the state's existing takeover law. He said the new measure unconstitutionally discriminated against certain businesses and was an improper regulation of interstate commerce. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> attorney general's office, said state officials had not decided whether to appeal the ruling. A Federated spokesman declined comment. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> stock rose 50 cents a share Monday to $ 60.75 in active <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. The ruling removed one legal obstacle to <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to acquire <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>, which has been spurning the Canadian concern's offers <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> has a pending $ 61 a share hostile tender offer, totaling about $ 5.4 billion. It also has made an alternative offer to acquire the retailer for $ 66 a share, about $ 5.8 billion, in a definitive merger agreement. The Toronto-based company had indicated the anti-takeover law could prove to be an impediment in arranging financing for the acquisition. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> also has challenged another recently passed anti-takeover law in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> is incorporated. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s law violated federal measures aimed at avoiding inconsistent regulation of commerce among states. The judge said the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> law is `` discriminatory on its face'' because it regulates only takeovers by certain businesses organized in foreign countries. He said federal law prohibits such discriminatory legislation by states. The judge agreed with <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> attorneys that the Canadian corporation could suffer irreparable injury because of the law. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s board of directors on Friday rejected <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 66 a share proposal, saying they were not convinced that <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> had solid financing for the deal. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> operates department and mass-merchandising stores in 36 states and had sales of more than $ 11 billion last year. Its divisions include <ORGANIZATION> Abraham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Straus </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnin </PERSON> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Filene </ORGANIZATION>'s of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Burdines </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>

<HEAD>Henley Proposes Santa Fe Scrap Part of Restructuring, Sell It More

<DATELINE>LA JOLLA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is pondering a proposal from <ORGANIZATION> Henley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to scrap part of the railroad-energy giant's restructuring and sell $ 780 million in new stock to the dissident investor. The move, which would boost <PERSON> Henley </PERSON>'s stake in Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> to 34.3 percent from 15.7 percent, was announced Monday and faced an uncertain reaction from <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, which has been fending off <PERSON> Henley </PERSON>'s unwanted overtures since mid-1987. <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gehrt </PERSON> said the proposal would be taken up at <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION>'s regularly scheduled board meeting later today but would not comment further. <PERSON> Henley </PERSON>'s proposal called for <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> to stop the planned payment of $ 5 per share in high-yield `` junk bonds'' for each of its 157.3 million shares on March 1. <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> already has made a $ 25-per-share cash payout. <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> has claimed persistently that the pay-in-kind debentures would leave shareholders with a large tax liability because of the way they are structured. Instead, <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> proposed that <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> sell <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> $ 780 million worth of new stock at $ 17.50 per share. Proceeds from that deal would be used to make a onetime $ 5-per-share cash payout to all current shareholders. The proposed deal would mean 44.6 million new shares for <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> and would boost <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION>'s total shares outstanding to 201.9 million. But <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> said the proposal was dependent on <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION>'s annulment of a `` poison pill'' takeover defense that would make a hostile acquisition prohibitely expensive Under the measure, if any hostile suitor exceeds 20 percent ownership in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>'s stock, other <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> shareholders would be permitted to buy new stock at half price. <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> now owns 24.6 million shares, or 15.7 percent, of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, a railroad, land and natural resources concern that has been attempting to restructure because of federal regulatory rulings forcing it to sell one of its two railroads, either the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> line or <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> line. Together, those lines constitute the nation's third-larges rail system extending over of 26,000 miles of main track. <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> repeatedly has criticized <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>'s adoption of the `` poison pill,'' saying the measure restricted the ability of major holders to maneuver. In another development Monday concerning <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, Denver-based <ORGANIZATION> Rio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grande </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> filed an application with the <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to acquire the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> line for $ 1 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> already has approved an expedited schedule for the application, with a final decision expected in six months, <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> said. <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>'s action threw into question <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s rival bid of more than $ 1.25 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> L.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rothschild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a venerable investment firm that once served wealthy clients, later became dangerously diversified and was devastated by the October stock market crash, is selling itself to a <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> company despite earlier vows to remain independent. The announcement on Monday signaled the latest casualty from the stock collapse and the first major Wall Street firm to be acquired by a savings and loan company. It also marked the end of an era for the 89-year-old brokerage, which had been hemorrhaging even before Black Monday, Oct. 19. Since then, several small firms have been forced out of business, and <ORGANIZATION> E.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's largest investment firms, agreed in December to be acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON>, which also announced a $ 128.8 million loss for the final quarter of 1987, previously had sold virtually all its retail stock brokerage operations, cut staff by more than 40 percent and undertaken several other austerity moves The firm said it would merge with <ORGANIZATION> Stern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an investment bank in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. wholly owned by <ORGANIZATION> Franklin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which in turn is owned by <ORGANIZATION> Franklin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ottawa </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kan </PERSON>. The purchase price still was subject to adjustment, but estimated at about $ 4.40 in cash and securities for each of <ORGANIZATION> Rothschild </ORGANIZATION>'s 15.1 million shares, or about $ 66.4 million. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>'s major subsidiary is <ORGANIZATION> Franklin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, which had $ 9 billion in assets at the end of 1987. It also has brokerage, insurance, mortgage banking and financial consulting operations. `` The merger ... will form a unique investment banking combination,'' said <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischer </PERSON>, chairman of <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Savings </PERSON>, who along with his wife owns just over half of the company's stock. `` It brings together the advantages of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading desk and regional distribution.'' `` Our <ORGANIZATION> Stern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> clients will receive expanded underwriting and distribution capabilities. For <PERSON> L.F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON>'s clients, we will provide risk management and solid financial backing,'' he said. Franklin Financial will provide a 2 -LCB- - year, $ 30 million loan to <ORGANIZATION> L.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rothschild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the broker-dealer subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> L.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rothschild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION>, the announcement said In a separate announcement, <ORGANIZATION> Rothschild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> reported severe losses for both the fourth quarter and all of 1987, reflecting both the impact of the stock market crash and other troubles <ORGANIZATION> Rothschild </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 128.8 million on revenues of $ 32.5 million in the quarter, compared with a net loss of $ 15.4 million on revenues of $ 92.4 million in the same period of 1986. For the full year, it lost $ 129.1 million on $ 461.4 million in revenues, compared with an after-tax profit of $ 498,000, or 3 cents per share, on $ 401.1 million in revenues in 1986. It said approximately $ 56 million of the losses resulted from arbitrage and over-the-counter trading positions held during the stock market's collapse. An additional $ 15 million in losses stemmed from the post-crash bankruptcy of <ORGANIZATION> Haas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, a correspondent firm of <PERSON> Rothchild </PERSON>'s broker-dealer subsidiary. In addition, <PERSON> Rothchild </PERSON> said quarterly and annual losses reflected at least $ 28 million in charges related to cutbacks in staff and offices and the sale of its retail brokerage business. Once considered a specialty investment banking house that serviced extremely wealthy clients, <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON> later evolved into a publicly held firm that expanded into government bonds, mutual funds, arbitrage and other areas. The company encountered trouble in late 1987, when a management dispute surfaced over whether the company was becoming excessively diversified. Two Rothschild principals who opposed diversification abruptly quit and the firm foundered thereafter. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berger </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Rothschild </ORGANIZATION>'s president, had said in a statement to the press on Dec. 7 that the firm intended to remain independent, `` get our house in order and as quickly as possible return this business to profitability.'' The company has scrapped its public finance and municipal bond activities and agreed to sell its securities brokerage operations in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. It is in the process of closing offices in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Liechtenstein </LOCATION> and is trimming its activities in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has extended until midnight Friday its $ 66-a-share offer for a friendly merger with <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Meanwhile, a federal judge Monday threw out an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> anti-takeover law enacted to protect <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> from the Toronto-based developer. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement Monday that without a friendly merger it would continue its hostile tender offer at $ 61 a share, or $ 5.4 billion. The friendly offer, which previously expired Sunday, totals $ 5.8 billion. A Federated representative had no comment on the renewed offer. The Cincinnati-based retailer twice last week rejected the $ 66-a-share bid, saying <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> had not shown it had adequate financing. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s board has delayed implementing a company shareholder-rights plan until midnight Thursday. The rights plan, a so-called `` poison pill'' defense, is designed to make a hostile takeover too expensive. A <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> representative said the retail and real estate company was renewing its offer `` to remind -LRB- <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s -RRB- board we're very interested in signing a transaction.'' At the same time, Chief U.S. District Court Judge <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> ruled unconstitutional the state's anti-takeover law enacted Feb. 12. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> had no comment when asked if an appeal was planned. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said that while states have a role in the regulation of commerce, the new law `` is discriminatory on its face.''

 Japanese companies spent 3.945 trillion yen, or about $ 30.34 billion, on advertising in 1987, up 8.1 percent from the previous year and the highest increase in six years, a report released Tuesday said. <ORGANIZATION> Dentsu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest advertising agency, said the increase reflected the recovery of the Japanese economy led by rising domestic demand, and Japanese firms' efforts to expand their doemstic business activities. The previous highest annual increase was 8.2 percent in 1981, although the standard for the survey was modifieid in 1985 by eliminating advertising for promoting exports, <ORGANIZATION> Dentsu </ORGANIZATION> said. Corporate spending on advertisements in newspapers and magazines and on radio and television was 259 trillion yen, or about $ 19.95 billion, up 7.7 percent from 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Dentsu </ORGANIZATION> said. That accounted for 65.7 percent of total advertising expenses. <ORGANIZATION> Dentsu </ORGANIZATION> said advertising through direct mail, outdoor ad services, inserts and exhibitions was 1.344 trillion yen, or $ 10.3 billion.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> completed its effort to buy <ORGANIZATION> Sterling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> today by acquiring more than 96 percent of Sterling's stock during the 20-day tender offer, a <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> acquired about 54.5 million shares of Sterling stock by the midnight Monday deadline and will now complete the merger `` in the matter of a few days,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. The acquisition, the largest in <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> history, has attracted a great deal of criticism from stock analysts who said <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> was paying too much for the drug and household products company. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> had agreed to pay $ 89.50 a share for the 57 million outstanding shares of <LOCATION> Sterling </LOCATION> stock, which is more than $ 34 higher than the stock was selling for at the end of 1987.

 Stock prices were narrowly mixed this morning after pushing to their highest levels in six weeks in the previous session. Trading was more active than in Monday's session. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which jumped 25.70 points on Monday to its highest level since Jan. 7, backed off 1.33 to 2,038.96 after 90 minutes of trading. But advancing issues took a slight lead over losers in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 639 up, 584 down and 512 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 81.94 million shares as of 11 a.m. on Wall Street compared with 52.26 million shares at the same point on Monday. The stock market has benefited recently from indications that the economy may be stronger than had been expected, leading some analysts to take an optimistic view of the outlook for corporate profits. But there is plenty of uncertainty about the economy's prospects. In a new report today, the government said orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for durable goods plunged 2.8 percent in January, the biggest decline in a year. But that statistic has been volatile, and many analysts expected a decline in January because it had risen by an unusually large 4.1 percent in December. Stock traders were also looking to today's congressional testimony by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said the country faces `` formidable challenges'' in keeping the economic recovery alive, urged further progress on reducing the federal deficit and cautioned <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> against passing protectionist trade legislation.

<HEAD>Two Specialists Surrender Market-Making Roles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two stock specialist firms have agreed to give up their roles as market-makers in three stocks, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> said. The moves are part of a review of the performance of specialists during the October stock market crash, the exchange said in a press release Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said that <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> O'Donnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> would surrender its market-making role in <ORGANIZATION> Neiman-Marcus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> common stock next week. <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Branche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> will give up its rights to market <ORGANIZATION> E.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on March 3. The franchises in the affected issues will be reallocated by the exchange, <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> officials said. In the case of <PERSON> E.F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>, a large securities firm due to be merged with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the stock is expected to be delisted by the exchange around March 24. The exchange's 53 specialist firms each control lucrative franchises to market certain stocks and are required to maintain orderly trading in those issues by setting opening prices and covering trades when there are too few buyers or sellers. Following the crash, the exchange launched investigations into the volatile behavior of some issues and the specialists assigned to them. The activity of market specialists also was criticized by a presidential task force and the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in their separate probes of the October collapse. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> said the agreements with <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> and <PERSON> LaBranche </PERSON> were reached voluntarily after discussions with the firms. In the case of <PERSON> LaBranche </PERSON>, the exchange's review centered on the firm's handling of <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> stock, but because of the imminent delisting of that issue, the firm also agreed to accept the withdrawal of its Edwards franchise as a penalty, the exchange indicated. The exchange did not disclose the results of its investigations into the trading of <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Neiman-Marcus </ORGANIZATION> stock, but extreme volatility appeared to have prompted the inquiries. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> has taken action in four situations since the crash. Previously, Spear, <ORGANIZATION> Leeds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON> surrendered its franchise in <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> stock and <ORGANIZATION> J.J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meehan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> withdrew its rights to <ORGANIZATION> Gould </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Exchange officials would not say whether its inquiries into the activity of specialists were continuing, but <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> has told congressional investigators that reallocations of stock franchises was one means of repairing the damage caused by the crash

 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said today the country faces `` formidable challenges'' in keeping the economic recovery alive, urged further progress on reducing the federal deficit and cautioned <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> against passing protectionist trade legislation. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> confirmed that the central bank, in an effort to keep the recovery alive, had taken a `` small easing step a few weeks ago.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chairman said the central bank agreed with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration that recovery from the 1981-82 recession should last through this presidential election year, but said prospects for growth would be enhanced through further efforts to reduce the huge federal budget deficit, which raises <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dependence on foreign investment. `` We face formidable challenges over 1988 and beyond in meeting national economic goals of sustaining growth and progress toward price stability,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Banking subcommittee. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s comments came as part of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s semi-annual report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the conduct of monetary policy. It was the first time <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> has delivered the monetary report since he took over as chairman from <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> in August. <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> repeatedly lectured <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> during his eight years as <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chief over the need to reduce the soaring federal budget deficits and warned that the central bank could not be expected to carry the full burden of keeping the economic recovery going. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, sounding very much like <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>, echoed those same themes, contending in his testimony that the challenge of managing the economy `` can not be negotiated by the Federal reserve alone.'' `` For the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the most direct and beneficial approach would be to address the problem at its major source _ the federal budget deficit,'' he said. `` Reducing the deficit further would give us the opportunity to add to domestic saving and reduce dependence on foreign capital, while still encouraging much-needed investment spending.'' Since January a variety of interest rates, including home mortgage rates, have declined, leading many economists to speculate that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> had eased credit conditions. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> confirmed the move toward easier money, saying the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> had made the change amid indications of an economy that was slowing as the year began. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> had the leeway to loosen credit conditions because the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar had stabilized on foreign exchange markets. For part of last year, the central bank had been forced to push interest rates higher in an effort to support the dollar, which was declining rapidly in value. Higher interest rates in this country tend to make dollar-denominated investments more attractive to foreignes. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> released an economic forecast that was very close to the predictions made by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration when it released its budget last week. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said it believed the overall economy, as measured by the gross national product, would grow at rate of 2.0 percent to 2.5 percent this year, down from last year's growth of 3.8 percent. The administration is forecasting 2.4 percent GNP growth this year while many private economists believe growth will not reach 2 percent. In response to a question, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said that while the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> was expecting sluggish economic growth this year, it saw no evidence that a recession would occur because the economy was not exhibiting the kinds of imbalances that normally start appearing at the end of an expansion. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> was asked by Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, whether over the next 12 months he saw `` a greater danger of increased inflation or recession?'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> paused a moment and then responded, `` At the moment I would say the dangers are probably equal. It's very difficult to judge.'' At another point, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> disagreed openly with a contention by <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s chief economist, that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> had pursued a tight monetary policy during 1987. `` We did not perceive ourselves as being tight,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said. He claimed that <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> placed too much emphasis on the importance of monetary growth in foretelling future economic activity. To have controlled the growth in the money supply to the extent that <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> advocates would have triggered `` an unduly inflationary environment'' last year, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> testified. `` There is a difference of opinion between Mr. <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> and myself on this issue. It is an economist's disagreement,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chief refused under questioning to make a prediction on the course of short and long-term interest rates during the coming year, saying that for him to do so would be `` sheer mischievousness'' in light of the fact that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has direct influence over interest rates. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> predicted that the unemployment rate, because of the more sluggishgrowth, would not show any improvement, holding at around 5.8 percent to 6 percent. The unemployment rate currently is 5.8 percent. On inflation, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> predicted that consumer prices, as measured by an inflation index tied to the GNP, would rise 3.25 percent to 3.75 percent this year, a slightly better forecast than the administratin, which is looking for a 3.9 percent rise in the GNP price deflator, as the index is called. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> also revealed the money growth targets the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has set for 1988. These targets, while covering a broad range, serve as a policy guide for the central bank as it tries to supply enough money to keep the economy growing at a healthy rate while guarding against pumping out so much money that inflation is rekindled. In one measure of the money supply, M-2, which includes checking deposits plus cash held by the pubic along with savings accounts and money market accounts, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said it was aiming for growth of 4 percent to 8 percent. This was the same target set for a somewhat broader measure of money known as M-3. The central bank, as it did last year, decided to set no growth target for M-1, the narrowest guage of money, because of its erratic behavior in recent years. The ranges for M-2 and M-3 were slightly lower than the 1987 targets of 5.5 percent to 8.5 percent. M-2 actually grew much more slowly last year than the target, increasing only 4 percent, a fact that raised criticism inside the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration from some officials who contended that the central bank was pursuig a tight-money policy which was driving up interest rates and threatening a recession. The president's <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION> issued a report on Friday which said tight <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> money policies were partly responsible for triggering the Oct. 19 stock market crash. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, less than a month after succeeding <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>, led the central bank to increase its discount rate from 5.5 percent to 6 percent on Sept. 4. The action raising the rate the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> charges to make bank loans occurred as the value of the dollar was falling sharply and causing fears of higher domestic inflation.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

 Stock prices pulled back this morning, as the market ran into resistance in active trading after pushing to its highest levels in six weeks in the previous session. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which jumped 25.70 points on Monday to its highest level since Jan. 7, was off 12.60 at 2,027.69 at noon on Wall Street. Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of nearly 3 to 2 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 558 up, 802 down and 480 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 112.65 million shares as of noontime compared with 52.26 million shares at the same point on Monday. The stock market has benefited recently from indications that the economy may be stronger than had been expected, leading some analysts to take an optimistic view of the outlook for corporate profits. But there is plenty of uncertainty about the economy's prospects. In a new report today, the government said orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for durable goods plunged 2.8 percent in January, the biggest decline in a year. Many analysts had expected a decline in January, however, because orders had risen by an unusually large 4.1 percent in December. Stock traders were also looking to today's congressional testimony by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, who told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that the country faces `` formidable challenges'' in keeping the economic recovery alive. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, a technical market analyst for <ORGANIZATION> MKI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said the market's decline was `` a reflex reaction after pretty good runup'' over the past two weeks. `` The market is in a mature rallying phase subject to these short bouts of profit-taking,'' <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON> said, adding that he felt the market `` could regroup and work its way higher'' later. Among the most active issues on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> was unchanged at 19 ~, <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> was down \ at 40 -LCB-, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> was up 1 \ at 31 \ and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> was off \ <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> was unchanged at 42 -LCB- after saying it had agreed to pay the government $ 1.25 billion to settle an oil pricing dispute.

 <PERSON> Harlan </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. Strong has seen his share of losers in his work for <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's largest handlers of sweepstakes, rebates and product promotions But Strong says it's the winners who stand out, especially when they're as excited as a Detroit-area woman he called to inform that she and her family had won a trip to <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>. `` There was this long pause; then all I could hear was this blood-curdling scream,'' said <PERSON> Strong </PERSON>, the company's vice president of sales. The woman put down the receiver and <PERSON> Strong </PERSON> said he could hear her running through the house yelling the good news to her family for several minutes before returning to continue their conversation. `` I enjoyed that. It was a real honest expression of joy at receiving this,'' he said. Nationally, there are about 40 companies in the fulfillment industry, which takes its name from its work fulfilling rebate requests and product promotions and conducting sweepstakes. <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is one of five fulfillment companies in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, and its closest national competitor, the <ORGANIZATION> Maple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, is less than 20 miles away in Maple Plain. `` This is kind of the mecca of the fulfillment business,'' said Strong. The 17-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has grown from 15 employees to more than 1,000. That's nearly the population of this tiny town, from which the company took its patriotic-sounding name, 40 miles west of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. Business became so brisk that the company had to acquire its own post office a few years ago to handle its up to 2 million pieces of mail a week, ranging from consumers' requests for <ORGANIZATION> Duracell </ORGANIZATION> battery rebates to <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> soup bowls to sweepstakes entries. The 180,000-square-foot plant, which is completing its fourth expansion in 10 years, is highly automated, and that often surprises visitors, Strong said. In one room, employees do nothing but feed envelopes into automatic slitting machines to open them. `` I think people think there are folks sitting around the table opening envelopes,'' Strong said. That impression was closer to the reality of the company's earlier days when Strong recalls executives taking off their coats and joining workers in packaging watches to keep product promotions on schedule Selecting winners from thousands of contest entries has grown more sophisticated, too. `` In the old days, we used to dump them on the floor,'' Strong said. Now, workers randomly select 2 percent to 10 percent of the entries received each day until the contest deadline and place them in numbered boxes. After the contest deadline, workers draw numbered pingpong balls from a lottery drum and then pick the winners from the corresponding numbered boxes of envelopes. But the prizes _ TVs, VCRs, furs and jewelry and other goodies small enough to be stored at the plant _ are still kept locked in a carefully guarded storage area. The privately held company, which does not disclose its financial figures, promotes its security when selling its services to its clients, mostly Fortune 500 companies, by touting its computerized tracking of mail and products as they move through the company. The company installed a paper shredder more than two years ago to destroy mailed-in rebate forms after people began digging through landfills to retrieve other companies' discarded ones, Strong said. He is proud of the company's record of employee honesty. <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has never had to discipline a worker for trying to influence contest drawings or stealing rebate forms, Strong said. <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is the largest single employer in <LOCATION> Carver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, a dairy farming area that's beginning to give way to the suburban sprawl of the Twin Cities. Many employees have been with the company for years, and up to 20 people a day apply for jobs there. `` If I left here to get a job with this kind of status and variety, I would have to go to <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Feltmann </PERSON>, a senior client service representative who began working for the company 14 years ago a few hours a day at home. `` I was a young mother and had a college loan to pay and I did n't want to have my husband pay for that,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Feltmann </PERSON>, 35. Company officials were so impressed with her work that they brought her to the plant, where she now supervises others. About 600 employees are home checkers and home data entry personnel, verifying customers' entries, rebates and order forms and typing the information for entry into the company's computer system, which is capable of canceling multiple requests from the same household. Customer service, where 30 people respond to incomplete rebate forms and handle requests for exchanges on product promotions, also is a fast-growing segment. The employees answer toll-free numbers set up to handle customer inquiries. A wholly owned telemarketing subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Direct </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Edina </LOCATION>, was formed last year and already employs about 100 people.

 A group of Japanese gets off a bus chartered by <ORGANIZATION> Hokubei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tours </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to gaze at the Statue of Liberty. But these Far Easterners are not mere picture-taking tourists _ they're entrepreneurs who want to own a piece of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, rather than just eyeball it <PERSON> Hokubei </PERSON>, whose most popular tour shuttles visitors to as many as five cities in pursuit of anything from a ski chalet to a factory to a wide-open prairie, is just one company catering to the swelling ranks of small Japanese investors interested in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> property. Big cash-rich corporations, like <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fudosan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which bought <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Exxon building in 1986, have been the biggest players in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market up to now, and experts say they'll likely dominate the $ 4 billion to $ 10 billion in purchases expected this year But smaller investors also are making a mark, quietly traveling the nation, visiting with local business people and getting a feel for the landscape. A recent study by <ORGANIZATION> Cushman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Wakefield </PERSON>, a major real estate company, found that Japanese institutional investors rate real estate as their most important investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, well ahead of government bonds and corporate stock. The new wave of Japanese buyers is being drawn to this country by high returns and comparatively cheap property. The average price per square foot for high-quality office space in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> is $ 4,000, while office space of similar quality in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> commands $ 400 per square foot or less, according to <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Shulman </PERSON>, director of real estate research at <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Lower interest rates and the dollar's drop against the Japanese yen make such bargains too good to pass up for many Japanese investors, who stand to reap yields three times higher than in their own country With their penchant for savings, Japanese who have amassed as little as $ 500,000 are realizing they can own a luxury condominium in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and pay someone else to manage it. More ambitious investors might join forces to buy a piece of commercial property. What may be equally noteworthy is that they also are `` spreading out from main-tier cities,'' <PERSON> Shulman </PERSON> said. Their interest no longer is exclusively focused on a handful of major urban areas. At <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles-based </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hokubei </LOCATION>, which specializes in promoting Japanese-American business relationships, research manager <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Laub </PERSON> said the company arranged 30 real estate tours last year and expects to do as many this year, if not more. During the planning stages of a trip, investors are asked what type of property they would like to see and in what geographic regions. Then <PERSON> Laub </PERSON> makes the appropriate real estate contacts, while others arrange for accommodations, transportation and interpreters. `` They wo n't just go to one city,'' he said. `` Most want to see four or five cities.'' Typically, he said, investors spend `` five to seven days in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, then maybe they'll fly to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, then down to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, up to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The whole thing could be two or three weeks.'' Most often investors ask to see office buildings, although there is increasing interest in upscale residences like single-family homes or condominiums valued at a minimum $ 500,000, <PERSON> Laub </PERSON> said. When on tour, `` it's all business'' from Monday to Friday, said <PERSON> Laub </PERSON>, who added that arrangements can be made if travelers `` want to go play golf, or if they're in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and want to go to the Empire State Building. Some want to go to <LOCATION> Epcot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Center </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>.'' Many of the tours <PERSON> Laub </PERSON> arranges are sponsored by big Japanese institutions like <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, which ultimately hope to serve as lenders if deals are consummated. Independent investors, who usually travel in small groups, must foot the $ 3,000-to - $ 6,000 bill for a two-week trip on their own `` On the first trip, they like to get a feel for the area,'' he said. Actual deals are negotiated on subsequent visits. Despite all the tours <PERSON> Laub </PERSON> has arranged, he has no idea how many have actually resulted in definite sales agreements. `` They come in secretly to close on deals ... I do n't know what is sold,'' he said. Others also have discovered that real estate can be a common language when talking to the Japanese. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Hori </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bunker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, puts out newsletters in Japanese that list <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> properties for sale. While several property owners complain of a lack of response to the ads, <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> insists that if he keeps on publishing, he'll penetrate the market `` Translation is very important,'' said <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON>, adding that the Japanese `` expect the same preferential treatment they've been giving us.'' <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivey </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Piping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Sand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, said he has had some nibbles from Japanese interested in the shuttered welding plant he is trying to sell in <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Although he advertised with <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON>, he said his contacts came from elsewhere. Much foreign interest has centered on southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where investors can cash in on the maquiladora concept, in which companies set up manufacturing facilities in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to take advantage of cheap labor while maintaining office operations just miles away in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Last year, a full busload of Japanese descended upon the southern part of the Lone Star state, hitting `` every town on the border from <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Pranis </PERSON>, who, as vice president of economic development for the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION>, played host when the group reached <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` They're like information vacuum cleaners,'' he said. `` They're very courteous and well-mannered, but they've got a very good idea what they're looking for They asked very pointed questions.'' Elsewhere, a developer who asked not to be named said Japanese are among those interested in a package of two buildings that comprise an entire block in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>'s prime business district. Even <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a retired salesman in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, spent a couple of hundred dollars on an ad to sell the 35 acres of land he owns in central <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> to the Japanese. At $ 69,000 for the parcel, he thinks it's a bargain.

 The president of the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> television network indicated <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> is unlikely to sell programming to <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed new cable network, unless <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> owned a portion of the parent company. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> TBS </ORGANIZATION> discussed the possibility of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> taking part ownership of Atlanta-based TBS. But the companies announced in mid-January that the talks had been halted. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said Monday the network would be interested in helping program the proposed <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> only if it owned a piece of TBS. `` We could be very interested in selling programming to it, but I just do n't see that happening,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said after speaking to a civic group in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` The problem with <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> is that it is very much involved in the organizational, ownership issues'' that blocked <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to buy an interest in TBS last year, he added. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> reportedly had attempted for the second time in three years to purchase up to 25 percent of TBS for $ 400 million. TBS is hoping to launch the new cable network in July.

 <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Emil </PERSON> never envisioned traveling all the way to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to sell some of the 54 luxury condominiums he developed in lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. And he was more than a little skeptical when <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fujisankei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> approached him about featuring one of the units on a home-shopping broadcast that would air in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION> and nine other cities in late January. A Fujisankei representative explained that the communications giant's satellite shopping network `` markets high-ticket items,'' <PERSON> Emil </PERSON> said. `` They said they sold a chateau in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.'' And what could be more high-class than his condos, which range in price from $ 500,000 to $ 1.7 million and feature such amenities as sub-zero refrigerators in the gourmet kitchens, 17-foot ceilings and a 24-hour concierge in addition to the doorman. <PERSON> Emil </PERSON> had a hard time with the notion that someone would buy an apartment without `` physically visiting the property,'' although he said it does happen from time to time. But Fujisankei promised, after a single broadcast, to present him with 20 to 25 qualified buyers. `` I'm assuming these are real buyers,'' he said shortly before leaving for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in early February. But 16,000 miles later and one week later, <PERSON> Emil </PERSON> was a believer. `` You can sell apartments in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by television in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' he exclaimed. While <PERSON> Emil </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Fujisankei </LOCATION> introduced him to fewer qualified buyers than promised, he was still pleased. None of the investors signed on the dotted line, but <PERSON> Emil </PERSON> said several are coming to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to see the landmark building in the near future, and he's confident he'll close on more than one deal. <PERSON> Emil </PERSON> described the buyers as wealthy executives who do business in and around <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and were attracted by the building's luxury qualities. `` I expected a number of offshore buyers, but that I would schlep myself over to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> ...,'' he joked. Fujisankei's January broadcast proved to be successful not only for <PERSON> Emil </PERSON>. A limousine used by Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> XXIII </PERSON> also sold _ to an unnamed bidder for $ 423,000.

 Japanese who invest in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> real estate evoke mixed emotions on this continent, angering Americans competing to buy the same properties but pleasing sellers. `` They have come into the market with a tremendous new source of capital, and prices have gone up on the very small, upper-tier of properties they're interested in,'' said <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Minikes </PERSON>, a managing director at <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wootton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, an international real estate firm headquartered in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Among those `` upper-tier'' properties are <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Exxon building, which was sold to <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fudosan </ORGANIZATION> for $ 610 million; the <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Towers </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, which sold for $ 620 million to <ORGANIZATION> Shuwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; and the <ORGANIZATION> Equitable </ORGANIZATION> building in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, for which <ORGANIZATION> Nissei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realty </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 250 million. `` Whenever more money is chasing a good product, prices have to go up. It's very simple economics,'' he said. But Americans who expected to pay less for quality commercial property in major cities `` are upset with the Japanese,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Shulman </PERSON>, director of real estate research at <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, while `` building sellers are very happy.'' <PERSON> Shulman </PERSON> estimated that prices for quality office buildings could drop by as much as 10 percent to 15 percent if the Japanese ceased buying property or became less aggressive in their purchases. Japanese can afford to pay more because they are guaranteed to reap far greater yields in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> than at home. For example, a $ 100 million investment in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would probably yield 1 or 2 percent a year, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Montinari </PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Cushman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Wakefield </PERSON>, a national commercial real estate firm. Yield is what investors earn after they subtract expenses from rent collected. But the yield on the same $ 100 million investment in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> real estate `` is certain to be 6 to 9 percent. Comparing oppportunity to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> versus the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is anywhere from triple to more,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, high-quality commercial real estate appreciated between 50 percent and 60 percent in price from 1985 to 1986, shutting out potential investors from their domestic market and turning their attention to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where prices for comparable properties rose about 15 percent, <PERSON> Shulman </PERSON> said. The fall in the value of the dollar against the yen also has lured Japanese investors, but a cheaper dollar can be `` a double-edged sword,'' Minikes said. `` Most Japanese investors are looking at the rise in value of the yen as a way to make the purchase cheaper, but you realize that if the yen keeps rising, their investment _ which is generating <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars _ will show a lower yield, he explained. While some Americans are miffed at the cash-rich Japanese companies that are snapping up top properties at top dollar, real estate companies have adapted to serve a new market. `` We constantly have groups coming through who want us to tell them about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> real estate,'' <PERSON> Minikes </PERSON> said. `` We regard them as a continuing source of profitable business.''

<HEAD>National Westminster Bank's 1987 Profit Plummets 30.1 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s largest bank, said Tuesday its profit sank 30.1 percent last year, mainly as a result of higher provisions against loans to Latin American countries and heavy losses at its investment bank. The bank said its 1987 earnings totaled 429 million pounds, or $ 759 million, down from 614 million pounds, or $ 1.09 billion in 1986. On a per-share basis, that worked out to 57 pence, or $ 1 per share in 1987, compared with 94 pence, or $ 1.66 in 1986. The bank said its provisions against loans to lesser developed countries, including <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and other Latin American countries, now total 810 million pounds, or $ 1.43 billion _ 33 percent of its total exposure of 2.47 billion pounds, or $ 4.37 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Natwest </ORGANIZATION> raised its provisions against loans to lesser developed countries to 30 percent last summer, and later by another 3 percent, to keep it within guidelines set up by the Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Natwest </ORGANIZATION>'s international banking unit swung to a loss of 339 million pounds, or $ 600 million, from a profit of 223 million pounds, or $ 395 million, because of the increased provisions and the lower dollar. The group's investment banking division widened its loss to 116 million pounds, or $ 205 million last year, from 38 million pounds, or $ 67 million in 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Natwest </ORGANIZATION> blamed continuing development costs and the effects of the October stock market's crash. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> had a loss of 95 million pounds, or $ 168 million, after increasing its provision for loans to lesser developed countries to 35 percent. That loss compared with a profit of 68 million pounds, or $ 120 million, in 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Natwest </ORGANIZATION> said its results were encouraging in the light of the experience of banks worldwide in 1987.

 <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> shoved aside two competitors last year to reclaim the title of the nation's largest defense contractor, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. Releasing its annual rating of the top 100 military contractors, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> had jumped past <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to win the top ranking for fiscal 1987. The St. Louis-based <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> increased its Pentagon work by $ 1.1 billion during the year to a new total of $ 7.7 billion, easily surpassing <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION>. General Dynamics, ranked No. 1 in fiscal 1986 with $ 8 billion worth of contracts, fell to No. 2 in 1987 with work valued at $ 7 billion. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> also suffered a decline in contract awards, falling from the $ 6.8 billion it won in 1986 to $ 5.8 billion in fiscal 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report covers the fiscal year ending last Sept. 30, and is considered the most definitive gauge of how major military contractors are faring each year. The report discloses that the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s contractors were fighting over a smaller pie in fiscal 1987, with prime contracts totaling $ 142.5 billion being parceled out. That is $ 3.2 billion less than the total awarded in fiscal 1986. Moreover, the top 100 companies, as a group, saw their share of those contracts decline slightly last year. The 100 firms received $ 95.4 billion of the contracts, or 66.9 percent of the total, compared to $ 98.6 billion and 67.7 percent in fiscal 1986. According to the rankings, there was only one company in the fiscal 1986 top 10 that failed to stay in that number last year. <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which is winding down its work on the new B-1B bomber, fell from fourth place on the 1986 list to 12th place in fiscal 1987 with contracts worth $ 2.2 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION>'s spot in the top 10 was claimed by <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which moved from 11th to seventh place in the rankings with work totaling $ 3.7 billion. The other top 10 rankings involved the same companies as in 1986, but in a different order. The fourth largest defense contractor in 1987 was <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which won contracts totaling $ 5.6 billion. It improved from sixth place the year before, when its military business totaled $ 4.9 billion. Fifth in the rankings was <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> with $ 4.1 billion. That was a decline from the $ 5.1 billion in work won by <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, but still enough to keep it at the same spot in the rankings. Rounding out the top 10 were <ORGANIZATION> Raytheon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, with $ 3.8 billion in contracts; <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION>, with $ 3.7 billion; <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, with $ 3.6 billion; <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, with $ 3.5 billion, and <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, with $ 3.4 billion. <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>' rise to the No. 1 spot is nothing new for the giant aircraft maker. While General Dynamics was No. 1 in 1986, <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> was the top-ranked contractor in fiscal 1984 and fiscal 1985. Some of the company's larger contracts include the F-A-18 Hornet fighter for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>; the F-15 Eagle for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>; the AH-64 Apache helicopter gunship for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, and the AV-8B Harrier jump jet for the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>.

 The stock market was drifting at modestly lower levels this afternoon as its recent rally ran into some resistance. Trading was moderate. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which jumped 25.70 points on Monday to its highest level since Jan. 7, was off 3.82 at 2,036.47 with two hours to go in the session. Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of nearly 4 to 3 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 677 up, 816 down and 441 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 147.77 million shares as of 2 p.m. on Wall Street with 109.87 million shares at the same point on Monday. Traders said the market seemed to pause after a sharp runup over the past two weeks. They said traders were also looking for clues in <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s testimony to a congressional panel about the central bank's view of the economy. The stock market has benefited recently from indications that the economy may be stronger than had been expected, leading some analysts to take an optimistic view of the outlook for corporate profits. But there is plenty of uncertainty about the economy's prospects. In a new report today, the government said orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for durable goods plunged 2.8 percent in January, the biggest decline in a year. Many analysts had expected a decline in January, however, because orders had risen by an unusually large 4.1 percent in December.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Finance Minister <PERSON> Edouard </PERSON> <PERSON> Balladur </PERSON> indicated Monday he was opposed to the planned sale of the French financial newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Les </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Echos </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Pearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, saying he wo n't allow the transfer of ownership to proceed automatically In a statement, <PERSON> Balladur </PERSON> said the 886 million franc, or $ 158 million, deal that was signed Jan. 11 between <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Les </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Echo </ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Beytout </PERSON> `` is subject to the explicit authorization of the French authorities.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Beytout </PERSON> called the government's position `` exclusively political,'' and the management of <ORGANIZATION> Les </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Echos </ORGANIZATION> said the newspaper would n't publish on Tuesday in protest. Under regulations, takeovers involving French companies and other <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> entities must be submitted for approval by the French treasury. If no objection is raised after a two-month period, the transaction goes ahead automatically. The ministry noted, however, that a 1986 press law stipulates that individuals or corporate entities that do n't reside in the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> ca n't acquire a stake of more than 20 percent in the capital of a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> publishing company without prior government approval. The ministry said `` the European character of the <ORGANIZATION> Pearson </ORGANIZATION> group does n't appear to be durably established at this time.'' Ministry officials said the main stumbling block to the sale is the 20.5 percent stake in <LOCATION> Pearson </LOCATION> held by media magnate <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s Australian press group, disclosed Jan. 13 that it had increased its stake in <LOCATION> Pearson </LOCATION> by purchasing a 4.9 percent block of shares from <ORGANIZATION> Cerus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>, the French investment arm of Italian financier <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Backs Company In Dispute Over Pensions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled unanimously Tuesday that businesses may not be sued in federal court in certain cases involving their contributions to union benefit funds. The court said the federal courts have no authority over cases in which companies refuse to contribute to multi-employer union benefit funds after a collective bargaining agreement expires. In an 8-0 ruling in a case from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the court rejected <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration arguments that barring lawsuits in such cases could undermine the solvency of the multi-employer pension plans. Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, in his opinion for the court, noted that in 1980 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> amended the Employee Retirement Income Security Act -LRB- ERISA -RRB- to provide a federal court remedy for trustees of the multi-employer benefit plans to collect delinquent contributions. But <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said the remedy does not extend to `` the employer's statutory duty to make post-contract contributions while negotiations for a new contract are being conducted. The federal courts have no authority to determine whether an employer's refusal to contribute to the funds in such circumstances is a violation of the National Labor Relations Act, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said. The case stems from a decision by <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lightweight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Concrete </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to withdraw from the union funds on June 15, 1983, when its collective bargaining agreement with its workers expired. The fund managers filed a federal court suit in December that year, seeking to force the company to pay into the pension plans for the period when the old contract expired until bargaining talks over a new contract reached an impasse. The unions said <ORGANIZATION> ERISA </ORGANIZATION> conferred such jurisdiction on the courts. The suit was dismissed on grounds that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has final say. The <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> had ruled against the unions in November 1983, rejecting claims that <ORGANIZATION> Advance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lightweight </ORGANIZATION> failed to bargain in good faith. Today's decision upheld a 1985 ruling by the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who joined the high court on Thursday, did not take part in the decision. The case is Welfare Trust Fund vs. Advanced Lightweight Concrete, 85-2079. In other cases Tuesday involving business: _ The court limited the job protection for government workers fired for lacking security clearances By a 5-3 vote, the justices agreed with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration that the <ORGANIZATION> Merit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> lacks authority to decide whether the denial of security clearance is justified. The court ruled against <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Egan </PERSON>, who was hired in 1981 as a laborer at the Trident Naval Refit Facility in <LOCATION> Bremerton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, on the condition he subsequently receive a security clearance. The facility is used to test and repair Trident submarines. All jobs at the facility require security clearance. _ The court, in a victory for three Midwestern states, limited the secretary of the interior's authority to allocate water stored in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> reservoirs The justices ruled unanimously that the <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> secretary exceeded his authority when in 1982 he approved a contract authorizing <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> ETSI </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to take water from <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oahe </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> for a coal slurry pipeline project. The decision is a victory for officials in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, which had blocked the now-scrapped pipeline project. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> took the other side. _ The court rejected claims by private landowners and ruled that the state of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> owns thousands of acres of oil - and gas-rich land near the state's <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> By a 5-3 vote, the justices said states may claim title to land beneath waters subject to the tie's influence _ and not only land under navigable waters. The ebb and flow of the tide, not navigability, determines the state's ownership, Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said for the court.

 Italian financier <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s economics minister on Tuesday called for a truce in the battle for control of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belgique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, the country's biggest holding company. `` Representative shareholders have to sit down at the table to discuss clear-cut principles: an industrial plan, the modalities of efficient management and a revitalization of the company,'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> said in a statement. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>, the largest independent stockholder, claims to own 43 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>'s 28.2 million shares outstanding. He has launched a bid for another 15 percent, but the stock price has since exceeded his offer of about 4,000 Belgian francs. <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> hit a new record Tuesday, closing at 5,350 francs, or $ 152.80, up about $ 7.15 from Monday. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> held meetings Tuesday with several top government officials, including Minister of Economy <PERSON> Philippe </PERSON> <PERSON> Maystadt </PERSON>, caretaker Prime Minister <PERSON> Wilfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vice-Premiers </PERSON> <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Verhofstadt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Philippe </PERSON> <PERSON> Maystadt </PERSON>. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> wants to create a pan-European holding company, but the Belgian government has maintained it wants <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> to remain firmly anchored in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. The 166-year-old company controls about half of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s top 50 companies and has interests in more that 1,200 companies worldwide. As speculation mounts as to whether a brittle alliance of Belgian and French financial groups could fend off <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>, the Italian financier called for a truce. `` As the most important shareholder by a wide margin, I want to make an appeal to reason,'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> said. `` There have been enough maneuvers in the corridors, enough artificial coalitions, enough unrealistic share counts, enough projects inspired only on the basis of personal interest.'' <PERSON> Maystadt </PERSON> also said that it would be `` desirable that all concerned parties without exception at last sit down around the same table.'' The French <ORGANIZATION> Cie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financiere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> and about 18 Belgian companies claim to hold more than 50 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>'s shares, but they have not officially agreed to form an alliance. <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> management has supported a Franco-Belgian alliance.

<HEAD>Government Clears BP's Offer For Britoil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The British government said Tuesday it would relinquish its `` golden share'' in <ORGANIZATION> Britoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, removing a major roadblock to <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 4.4 billion acquisition of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil company Since December, <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> has accumulated 79.8 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Britoil </ORGANIZATION>'s 504 million outstanding shares in a takeover bid priced at 2.5 billion pounds. The oil giant has been paying 500 pence, or $ 8.85, for each Britoil share. The government retained its special share _ which gives it a controlling vote over the company's affairs _ when it privatized Britoil in two stages in 1985 and 1982. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> said it would give up the share under certain conditions agreed to by BP. <PERSON> Britoil </PERSON> said its board of directors would meet to decide whether to abandon its resistance to <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION>'s offer. Britoil's shares rose 1.77 cents to finish at $ 8.83 -LRB- 499 pence -RRB- on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Stock Exchange Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION>'s shares finished unchanged at $ 4.39 -LRB- 248 pence -RRB-. The government does n't intend to exercise its special share as long as BP upholds promises to maintain headquarters for some of <PERSON> Britoil </PERSON>'s operations in <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, and meet other conditions, Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said in answer to questions in the House of Commons. Scottish politicians had expressed concern that the takeover would mean the loss of jobs in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said control of the golden share will eventually be transferred from the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, where legal moves will be taken to terminate it. `` An acceptable arrangement has been reached with BP,'' <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said. `` I am quite sure there will be no backsliding by <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said in a statement that the company was `` pleased that our discussions with the government have produced a successful resolution of the issues surrounding the special share.'' `` We believe the outcome will enable us to manage the assets of <LOCATION> Britoil </LOCATION> on a proper commercial basis in the interests of both our shareholders and the <LOCATION> U.K. </LOCATION> economy,'' <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said. But a Britoil spokesman, who asked not to be named, said, `` If you look at the statements -LRB- by the government and BP -RRB- you'll see it's a two-party agreement between the chancellor and BP.'' Although Britoil officials met with <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> officials concerning the government's use of the golden share, the company was n't a party to the agreement, he said.

 Share prices closed higher in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Tuesday, but were down sharply from their best levels in concert with weak early trading on Wall Street. Trading volume picked up from its recent slack pace as some good institutional buying interest emerged, dealers said. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished at 1,757.9, 10.7 points or 0.6 percent higher, just 1.2 points above its lowest level for the day. The index rose as much as 25 points in early trading, bolstered by strong gains overnight in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> stock markets. The strong tone was reinforced by news that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s real gross domestic product rose 1 percent in the fourth quarter of 1987 from the third quarter and was up 5.3 percent from a year earlier. Share prices showed little reaction to the GDP news, but dealers said the figures should help sustain a cautious optimism among market participants. Dealers said another factor boosting the market was expectations that substantial tax cuts would be included in the budget to be presented next month by the <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> government. Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said the government has agreed to give up its golden share in <ORGANIZATION> Britoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, clearing the way for the independent company's takeover by <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>.

 Stocks traded at modestly lower prices this afternoon as the market's recent rally ran into some resistance. Trading was moderate. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which jumped 25.70 points on Monday to its highest level since Jan. 7, was off 8.29 at 2,032.00 with one hour to go in the session. Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of about 4 to 3 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 669 up, 846 down and 436 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 165.28 million shares as of 3 p.m. on Wall Street with 131.66 million shares at the same point on Monday. Traders said the market was pausing after a sharp runup over the past two weeks. They said traders were hesitant to make big moves while <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> was testifying before a congressional panel about the central bank's view of the economy. The stock market has benefited recently from indications that the economy may be stronger than had been expected, leading some analysts to take an optimistic view of the outlook for corporate profits. But there is plenty of uncertainty about the economy's prospects. In a new report today, the government said orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for durable goods plunged 2.8 percent in January, the biggest decline in a year. Many analysts had expected a decline in January, however, because orders had risen by an unusually large 4.1 percent in December. Among the most active issues on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> were several utility stocks that will soon be paying dividends. <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> was the most active, and was unchanged at 19 ~ Among the blue chips, <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> was down \ at 40 -LCB-, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> was down \ at 29 | and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> was off \ at 115 <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> climbed 10 -LCB- to 34 -RRB- after <ORGANIZATION> Southdown </ORGANIZATION> disclosed it was offering $ 31 a share for the company.

 Grain and soybean futures prices closed moderately lower Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Wheat futures declined in reaction to the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement late Monday that it would replace its weekly auctions of surplus wheat with three weekly auctions beginning March 2, analysts said. Sales from the Friday auctions have declined in recent weeks, with last week's total of 11 million bushels falling far short of the target of 25 million bushels. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> set initial targets of 10 million bushels for each of the three new auctions, which will be held on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Traders fear that the new auctions could put as much as 30 million additional bushels of wheat onto the open market, which would tend to depress prices, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON>, an analyst for G.H. <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.

<TEXT>
 A computer magazine has published a story providing confidential details of a long-awaited Apple computer still under development. The article appearing in this week's edition of Macintosh Today was based on a 160-page confidential in-house document given to a free-lance writer by an <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> employee, the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The article details the size, appearance and technical specifications of <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> laptop model, which it said would be available in 1989. Apple has been hard hit by information leaks before, and even hired a private detective two years ago to find out who was releasing information. The investigator found leaks at firms developing software and accessories for Apple products, according to company spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Krause </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Krause </PERSON> declined to comment on the magazine report. The article describes a 12-pound laptop capable of running Macintosh software. It said the computer would have 1 megabyte of internal memory, the same as the Macintosh SE. It said the computer would have a flat-panel screen and be powered by a five-pound lead-acid battery that will last up to 10 hours before recharging.

<TEXT>
 Foreign ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> on Monday formally adopted decisions taken at last week's <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> summit on limiting farm subsidies and overhauling the group's finances. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> had made their acceptance of the summit agreement conditional on settlement of a relatively minor issue raised by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in the final stages of the Feb. 11-12 meeting. Officials said the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> foreign minister, <PERSON> Jean-Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Raimond </PERSON>, told Monday's meeting that his government remained unhappy with proposals for placing new controls on <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> subsidies to growers of such products as tobacco and wine. But <PERSON> Raimond </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> would allow the proposals to go forward without further debate. That cleared the way for the foreign ministers to formally adopt the overall summit agreement. By satisfying British and Dutch demands for strict limits on farm spending, the summit accords marked a breakthrough in the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s budget crisis. The 12-nation group has been operating without a formal budget since the start of the year and faced possible bankruptcy by late summer. <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> budget ministers are scheduled to meet Tuesday to adopt a draft 1988 budget. The spending plan then must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, the West German foreign minister and chairman of Monday's meeting, told reporters that adoption of the summit agreement was `` an important step forward in the history of the European Community.'' <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said he and Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials during a visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last week that the summit agreement will `` strengthen the economic vitality of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'' by permitting faster removal of trade barriers between <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> member countries and by giving more financial aid to the relatively poorer members in southern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The head of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday he did not expect <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to give the agency control of the stock index futures market and stressed the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> is working with futures regulators to prevent a recurrence of the October stock market crash. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> also indicated his agency was examining ways of reducing volatility of stock prices and trading volume, which he attributed partly to the use of margin in the stock index futures markets. In a speech to an economic outlook conference sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> repeated his agency's call to examine proposals for increasing coordination between the stock and futures markets and expanding the markets' capacity to deal with unprecedented trading volumes. Trading strategies involving stock index futures _ representing `` baskets'' of actual stocks _ have been widely blamed for worsening market volatility and contributing to the severity of the Oct. 19 market crash. <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> has contended the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> should have final regulatory power over all stock-related instruments, including the ability to overrule the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which now regulates such products. In testimony to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month, <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> asked for broad new powers over stock-related futures trading, such as increasing margin requirements and ordering temporary trading halts, to help prevent a recurrence of the crash. <PERSON> Kalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hineman </PERSON>, acting chairman of the commodities commission, in subsequent testimony resisted the idea of putting the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> in charge of stock index futures trading. During a news conference after Tuesday's speech, <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> defended his proposal but said he did not anticipate congressional support for <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> authority over stock index futures markets. He said that although he was not supporting a broad congressional revamping of the regulatory system, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s proposals would result in `` a more active and aggressive oversight of those markets'' by his agency That at times could entail pressuring the commodities commission to make market changes, <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said. But he also said he expected any future regulation to stem from `` cooperative'' proposals, and emphasized his agency's commitment to work closely with other regulators. <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said he and the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> staff had met with <PERSON> Hineman </PERSON> and the staff of the commodities commission to discuss `` a wide range of market-related topics.'' Similar joint discussions were held with representatives of the stock and futures exchanges and would continue as the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> attempted to formulate concrete steps for preventing another crash, <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said. In his speech, <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> again called for higher margin requirements _ the `` down payment'' a buyer must make _ for trading stock index futures and for other measures to improve liquidity in the futures markets. He said the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> would continue considering the effectiveness of delayed futures market openings. <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said the `` increased velocity and concentration'' of trading within the stock and futures markets and between those markets had increased the probability of wild price swings. He said the increased intensity of trading was due partly to the lower margin levels in the futures markets. `` Initial margin on stock inedex futures for non-market makers should be raised, at least temporarily, to levels harmonious with stock margin levels applicable to stock market professionals,'' he said.

 Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION> are recommending expanded production at the plant that could include a second passenger car line, the company stated Monday. However, the plant is not among the sites under consideration for a proposed joint venture with <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to build a new vehicle, company officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced that it would undertake a second phase of a study on the proposed joint venture and that a proposal would be made for top management review in May. A study committee indicated a site had not been selected yet but the <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION> facility _ which makes light trucks and Sentra cars, was not among those being considered. `` The joint venture project with <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> is looking at building a type of vehicle that is very different from the cars and trucks we build at <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Benefield </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of the <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION> plant. But officials said plant production may be expanded anyhow because of a proposed addition of a second passenger car line, and parts production may be increased. <PERSON> Benefield </PERSON> said he was recommending that the plant begin making three components: Sentra engines, truck axles, and front and rear bumpers for the Sentra. The new production would not require any new employees, officials said. The company also is considering adding a second passenger car line at the plant, which would require a larger work force. The company's board of directors will review the proposals at an April meeting.

<HEAD>Greenspan Remarks Get Negative Reaction From Metals Markets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s prediction of modest economic growth and continued low inflation received a sharp negative reaction on the precious metals futures markets Tuesday. On other markets, which were not necessarily affected by <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s comments, prices for future delivery of livestock, meat, orange juice, grains, soybeans and stock indexes all retreated. Energy futures advanced. Analysts said <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s 1988 economic forecast, delivered in testimony before a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, was viewed as a price depressant for precious metals, which tend to perform well as investments during bad economic times. `` The most important thing he said for the precious metals was that inflation is expected to be at a moderate rate of 3.25 percent to 3.75 percent for 1988,'' said <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Raptopoulos </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON>, commodity trading adviser for <ORGANIZATION> Josephthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said precious metals futures also were pressured by the day's lower prices for most other commodities, reflected by a 2.68-point decline in the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>'s index of 21 commodities. Among the precious metals, platinum futures registered the sharpest drop, falling $ 15 across the board at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for April delivery settled at $ 448.80 a troy ounce. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold settled $ 3 to $ 4.30 lower with April at $ 444.30 a troy ounce; silver was 11 cents to 11.8 cents lower with March at $ 6.30 a troy ounce. Some feeder cattle futures fell the daily limit of 1.50 cents a pound on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, and other livestock and meat futures also posted steep losses. Cattle futures weakened in reaction to a variety of fundamental factors, including relatively slack wholesale demand for beef products, high retail prices for beef, and good availability of slaughter-ready cattle, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hare </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. A monthly <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report showing the number of pork bellies in cold storage to be higher than the market had expected sent pork complex futures down sharply, <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> said Live cattle settled .70 cent to 1.23 cents lower with April at 71.77 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .75 cent to 1.50 cents lower with March at 81.02 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to .77 cent lower with April at 43.67 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1 cent to 1.85 cents lower with March at 51.80 cents a pound. Frozen concentrated orange juice futures sank on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to a price cut of $ 25 a ton for Brazilian juice, analysts said.

The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> set initial targets of 10 million bushels for each of the three new auctions, which will be held on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Traders fear that the new auctions could put as much as 30 million additional bushels of wheat onto the open market weekly, which would tend to depress prices, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON>, an analyst for G.H. <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.

<TEXT>
 The dollar was mostly lower after a session of choppy trading Tuesday. Gold prices also fell. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a late bid price for gold of $ 441.50 a troy ounce, down $ 2.75 from Monday's late bid. Analysts said the dollar gained some strength from reports of congressional testimony by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> early in the session, reversing overnight losses. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynam </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, said traders were encouraged by <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s statement that he saw no signs of a recession. Other analysts in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> cited his comment that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> money supply might grow at a faster pace this year. That spawned speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> might have to encourage higher interest rates to slow excessive money growth _ which would stimulate inflation. In turn, higher rates would make dollar-denominated investments more attractive, boosting demand for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. In the end, however, the dollar wound up mostly lower in trading described as choppy. <PERSON> Lynam </PERSON> said the market continued to be dominated by `` charts and technicals,'' making people `` less willing to hold on to their positions.'' `` The whole problem is that this has become a one-release market: the trade numbers, everyone focuses on that,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chorek </PERSON>, an analyst at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an investment firm. `` And after that, volume is just dead,'' he continued. `` So the market becomes keyed off of technicals.'' In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound rose to $ 1.7655 from $ 1.7630 late Monday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound stood at $ 1.7633, more expensive than Monday's late price of $ 1.7593. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar fell to a closing 128.50 Japanese yen from 129.95 yen at Monday's close. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trading later Tuesday, it edged up to 128.75 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it stood at 129.00 yen late in the day, down from Monday's 129.38 yen. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday, were: 1.6948 West German marks, down from 1.6979; 1.3933 Swiss francs, up from 1.3928; 1.2677 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2723; 5.7330 French francs, down from 5.7400; and 1,248.50 Italian lire, down from 1,249.50.

Gold bullion prices slumped everywhere. At the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold fell to $ 441.80 a troy ounce, down $ 3.80 from Monday's $ 444.90.

 <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> reported a 27 percent drop in first-quarter earnings Monday, but noted results for the year-earlier period were inflated by a $ 20 million gain from discontinued operations. Firestone reported earnings of $ 30 million or 94 cents a share, on sales of $ 976 million for the three months ended Jan. 31, compared with earnings of $ 41 million or $ 1.07 a share on sales of $ 846 million during the same period a year ago. Excluding a one-time gain of $ 20 million from the December 1986 sale of its North American wheel and rim business, <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION>'s first-quarter earnings were up 40 percent from a year earlier The results reflected improved automotive parts and service sales, increased income from credit-card operations, and larger profits from the company's diverisified-products operations due to higher natural-rubber prices and improved building-products sales, <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON> said in a news release. During the quarter, Firestone repurchased 3.6 million shares of its outstanding stock for $ 116 million. Firestone, which moved its headquarters from <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> during the quarter, announced last week it would sell a 75 percent interest in its tire-manufacturing operations to <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 1.25 billion.

The suit contended that if the proposed merger went through, <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Fuqua </PERSON> would control 50 percent of the wholesale photofinishing industry and 80 percent of the total market for photo-related paper and chemicals, said <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Landry </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The injunction will remain in effect pending a trial on the merits of the case. <PERSON> Fuqua </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>, in arguments supporting the merger, said the merger would result in a new company controlling only 25 percent of the total photofinishing market in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> antitrust division approved the proposed merger in December and said their investigation did not show any evidence that federal antitrust laws would be violated. On Dec. 7, <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> announced plans to merge its wholesale photoprocessing laboratories with <PERSON> Fuqua </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, N.C.-based subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Colorcraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Several financial analysts have lowered their opinions of <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> in recent weeks on grounds that the company overpaid for Sterling `` Obviously there are pros and cons to this,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellmann </PERSON>, a stock analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Wertheim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schroeder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` But I want to hear what management has to say.'' <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> will pay $ 89.50 for 54.5 million of the 57 million outstanding shares of Sterling stock, more than $ 34 higher than the stock was selling for at the end of 1987. The company will acquire the 2.5 million shares that were n't offered for sale for the same price after the deal is final, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said. The total value of the deal is expected to be $ 5.1 billion. Sterling, based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, has 22,000 employees and has annual sales of about $ 2 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, has 124,000 employees and annual sales of about $ 13 billion a year. The acquisition will help <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> move into the $ 110 billion pharmaceutical industry and give the company an established pipeline to get drugs to market, said <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s bond ratings were downgraded by <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> from A2 to Aa2 largely because of the heavy borrowing needed to pay for Sterling Sterling's bond rating was also downgraded from A2 to Aa1.

 <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> will pay <ORGANIZATION> Ambrit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> $ 8.5 million to settle a trademark battle over similar ice cream bars made by the two companies, <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> announced Tuesday. The 6-year-old case stemmed from <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>'s Polar B'ar ice cream bars, which Ambrit contended were packaged in a manner that infringed on the trademark of its own Klondike bar. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last May let stand a lower court ruling prohibiting Polar B'ar from using a wrapper resembling the Klondike package and denying Polar B'ar exclusive trademark rights to that name. The 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> had ruled in December 1986 that Polar B'ars may not have images of polar bears on their wrappers in imitation of the Klondike design. The appeals court also said Polar B'ars may have the color royal blue on their silver foil wrappers only if it did not make them `` confusingly similar'' to the Klondike wrapper. The appeals court also had ordered a federal judge to determine what damages if any <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> must pay Ambrit, which is based in <LOCATION> Clearwater </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, for imitating the Klondike wrapper. <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> said from its <LOCATION> Glenview </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, headquarters that the settlement was `` significantly less'' than the amount sought by <PERSON> Ambrit </PERSON> but declined to comment further, citing agreements by both parties not to discuss specifics of the case. The appeals court had canceled <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>'s Polar B'ar trademark because the company had abandoned the name from 1932, when it stopped making a like-named ice cream novelty, until it began marketing a new ice cream bar in 1979.

<HEAD>Southdown Offering $177 Million for Moore McCormack Resources</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Southdown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a cement and energy company, launched a $ 177 million cash tender offer Tuesday for <ORGANIZATION> Moore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McCormack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>. The offer is contingent on the valid tender of a majority of <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>'s common stock, the inapplicability of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>'s recently enacted anti-takeover law, the redemption or invalidation of <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>'s `` poison pill'' anti-takeover defense and <ORGANIZATION> Southdown </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to secure $ 635 million in financing, of which $ 500 million has been committed by a major commercial bank <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Doumlele </PERSON>, director of corporate relations for <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>, said the `` tender offer was totally unsolicited.'' On Monday, Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Southdown </ORGANIZATION> and its subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> SDW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, filed a federal lawsuit which seeks to overturn <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>'s anti-takeover defenses, including a poison pill provision that would make the acquisition prohibitively expensive The lawsuit claims that <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tregurtha </PERSON> tried to illegally block the tender offer. <ORGANIZATION> Southdown </ORGANIZATION> said in the suit that it will offer $ 31 a share for <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>, a building materials company. With 5.7 million <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> shares outstanding, the transaction would be worth about $ 177 million. <ORGANIZATION> Southdown </ORGANIZATION> said in its suit that unless the anti-takeover defenses are removed, it will be deprived of the right to make a bona fide offer and will be subjected to confusion, delay and lawsuits. The suit said <PERSON> Tregurtha </PERSON> and <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>'s board of directors violated their fiduciary responsibilities by setting up illegal obstacles that allegedly will prevent the company's shareholders from considering the tender offer. The suit also said that merger talks between the two companies were initiated by <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> a year ago and that <PERSON> Tregurtha </PERSON> insisted that he hold the posts of chairman and chief executive officer in the combined business. As a result, <ORGANIZATION> Southdown </ORGANIZATION> said, it concluded that its only alternative was to take a proposal directly to the shareholders of <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Southdown </ORGANIZATION> produces and sells cement and ready-mixed concrete and is in oil and gas exploration and development. It announced Monday that it has 137.6 billion cubic feet of proved natural gas reserves, up from 111.7 billion cubic feet last year. It attributed the increase to successful exploration in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> produces building materials and is also involved in oil and gas exploration and production, mainly in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. No hearing has been set for the case, assigned to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>.
