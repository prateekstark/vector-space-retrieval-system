<HEAD>Claim military truck involved in road accident carried nuclear
weapons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ILMINSTER, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A sports car crashed into a truck in a military convoy in western <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> Saturday and anti-nuclear activists claimed the convoy was transporting nuclear weapons. Police said the driver of the MG Midget car was killed but there were no other casualties. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said there was no danger to the public but he would neither confirm nor deny claims a truck leading the convoy was carrying nuclear depth bombs. The accident occurred near <LOCATION> Ilminster </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Somerset </LOCATION> when the car struck a bus and then crashed head-on into the huge transporter truck, according to police. They said the truck was slightly damaged. Members of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament said they trailed the convoy, which they claimed included four warhead transporters, from the time it left the <LOCATION> Burghfield </LOCATION> nuclear assembly facility near Reading, 35 miles west of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, earlier Saturday. Press Association, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s domestic news agency, said without attribution that the convoy was transporting four nuclear depth bombs to the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s armament depot in <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION> on the south coast. Depth bombs are designed for use aircraft to attack submarines. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hines </PERSON>, a spokesman for the environmentalist group <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>, said Saturday's accident and another convoy accident in January 1987 were `` a virtually inevitable consequence of the trundling around <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> of not only 128 Polaris missiles, but also the little-known 140 naval nuclear depth bombs and 50 naval nuclear free-fall bombs. `` It's time for this nuclear transport to stop and for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s naval nuclear weapons to be put upon the disarmament agenda,'' he said A spokesman for the Avon and <LOCATION> Somerset </LOCATION> police said the area was not evacuated. `` We have special contingency plans for situations where an accident occurs involving a sensitive load. They were not put into operation in this case,'' he said. He was not indentified in keeping with British practice. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, also speaking anonymously, called the collision `` a very minor incident.'' On Jan. 10, 1987, a 20-ton truck, part of a top-secret military convoy, skidded off an icy country road near <LOCATION> Salisbury </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. A large area was sealed off while the military spent 18 hours righting the vehicle.

 A paroled killer with a drug addiction was arrested Saturday night and charged with murdering a 24-year-old <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> artist a week after she arrived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to study, police said. The suspect, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> DeChirico </PERSON>, 37, of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, was grabbed by police on a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> street corner and charged in Wednesday's slaying of <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Wrappe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, said police spokesman Sgt <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>. DeChirico is addicted to crack, the highly potent cocaine derivative, and was paroled in December 1986 after serving 13 -LCB- years for manslaughter, <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> said. Miss <PERSON> Wrappe </PERSON> was shot in the chest when she would not give up her purse to a robber near the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> campus of the <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, where she had just begun studying for a graduate degree in fine arts. The arrest came hours after hundreds of friends and relatives gathered at a requiem Mass in her hometown and remembered Miss Wrappe for her spirit of independence and her vision as an artist. `` She wanted to stand on her own,'' said <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>. `` She wanted to prove her independence. That very spirit found her on the streets of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on the way home after finishing her part-time job earlier this week. On that street, the artist, the hard worker, died, a victim of senseless crime.'' <PERSON> DeChirico </PERSON> was picked up by police just blocks from the slaying, at about 7:30 p.m., said <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>. He was booked for murder, robbery and criminal possession of a deadly weapon, the spokesman said. The last charge involves the alleged murder weapon, which was not recovered, <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> said. Police had no immediate details about the suspect's previous manslaughter conviction. <PERSON> DeChirico </PERSON> was identified by several witnesses in the area of the shooting, <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> said. Miss <PERSON> Wrappe </PERSON> was fatally shot when she refused to surrender her purse to an attacker as she returned home from her first night at work. Witnesses said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Wrappe </PERSON>, who was shot in the chest, struggled with the robber and screamed as he took her purse about 1 a.m. one block from her dormitory. She was returning home after her first night at a part-time job as a waitress in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. Police found Miss <PERSON> Wrappe </PERSON>'s purse a couple of blocks away, with a dollar and other objects inside. Miss Wrappe, of <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, was a 1987 graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Notre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dame </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Wrappe </PERSON>'s parents gave their six children space to `` grow and be themselves. <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> marched to a different drummer. She set standards for herself. ... She was not afraid to be different. <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> was an artist _ photography, water coloring, charcoal, painting.''

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has sent two messages to <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> military leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in recent days inviting him to resume bilateral talks that collapsed in May, the general said in an interview. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said he sees the alleged overtures by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government as a `` positive step'' and added that his regime is ready to start `` serious, scientific and realistic'' negotiations immediately, The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in its Sunday edition. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials confirmed there were meetings with `` members of the ruling coalition'' in the last few days, but added these were part of `` regular meetings with a cross-section of Panamanian political leaders.'' They denied these were proposals for new negotiations. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said he is ready to meet face-to-face with ousted president <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> `` without preconditions,'' if that helps solve <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s crisis. Previously, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said he would never sit down with <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who unsuccessfully tried to fire him as commander of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s Defense Forces early this year <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had generally shunned the press since he was indicted Feb. 4 in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> for drug smuggling and his country exploded into political crisis. The <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> interview Thursday was at the main office of the General <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> military base in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hato </LOCATION>, about 68 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government in May offered to lift two drug indictments against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, if he would step down. But subsequently, presidential candidates <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> both said they oppose any deal that would result in dismissal of the indictments. Referring to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dispatches, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said, `` We have received a message from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> transmitted to us through -LRB- <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s -RRB- commerce minister <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Rognoni </PERSON>, with suggestions or open doors to continue the talks that had been suspended.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Maisto </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy chief of mission, delivered the message last Wednesday to <PERSON> Rognoni </PERSON>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said. An embassy official said `` written talking points'' were delivered describing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> positions on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, but said they were summaries of on-the-record <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has set out guidelines that no further negotiations with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> are expected.

<HEAD>Caribbean Religious Group Condemns Haiti's Rulers for Church
Massacre</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Caribbean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> denounced the killing of 13 parishioners and the burning of two churches in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> and urged the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> governments to condemn <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s military rulers. But late Saturday, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> deposed its military leader, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>, and two military commanders took power, a government spokesman said in <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>, the Haitian capital. It was unclear whether the attacks on Sept. 11 and the following day, blamed on the government, were related to <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s ouster. The church council, which represents <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> churches in 16 <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> countries, said the bloody attacks were `` cold-blooded cruelty which was shocking even by the brutal standards of Haitian repression.'' While army critic Rev. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> said Mass Sept. 11 at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, two dozen people armed with guns and knives attacked killed parishioners before burning down the building as soldiers watched from across the street. Nine were killed in the massacre and 77 were wounded, of which four died at in the hospital, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haiti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday. Five men and a woman that night boasted on government television they took part in the massacre, and the next day arsonists burned down a second Roman Catholic church. `` The inaction of the government security forces can only be interpreted as collusion with the method of terrorizing the Haitian population into silence,'' said the council's statement, released Friday. Though the government of Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> said it `` regretted'' the massacre and promised to punish the culprits, similar statements issued after mass killings in the past have never resulted in investigations or convictions. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> returned to power after ousting the 4-month-old government of civilian President <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> in a coup June 19. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> previously ruled for two years after the exile to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> of President-for-Life <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> on Feb. 7, 1986. But on Saturday, <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> was ousted in a military coup and taken to the airport, said <PERSON> Frantz </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s director of information. <PERSON> Lubin </PERSON> said he believed Commander Prosper <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> had been named the new head of state and <ORGANIZATION> Dessalines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barracks </ORGANIZATION> Commander <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> as new commander-in-chief of the army.

 Almost 200 tourists expressed their relief and thanks over being home when they landed here Saturday night after enduring Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Damage in the Mexican resort was extensive, said passengers upon arrival at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> at 8:53 p.m. EDT. `` <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION> does n't exist anymore,'' said <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardoso </PERSON>, who weathered the hurricane in a hotel. `` We were lucky. Our hotel is a very old, well-built building. `` Unfortunately, those poverty stricken people are really suffering. They're going to have to start all over again.'' `` Everybody's glad to be home,'' said <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The first thing the tourists requested was fresh water, said an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> crew member. Eastern does not normally fly to <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>, but arranged for an L-1011 jet with room enough for 316 passengers to pick up the stranded tourists after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> appealed for help, said the airlines' chief spokesman, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON>. Hundreds of Americans were scattered in shelters in <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>, passengers said, but only 196 made it to the airport in time to take the flight. Eastern delayed takeoff for almost two hours and sent members of the plane's ground crew into town in hopes of picking up more passengers, but many tourists never got the word, the passengers said. The airline encouraged <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area hotels to let the tourists stay overnight free of charge, <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. `` We're trying to keep their costs to a minimum,'' he said. <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> accommodations would be a welcome change compared to the shelters they stayed in during the hurricane, said <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION> `` They put eight of us in a room with two beds, no power, no lights, no food and no plumbing for two days,'' she said. `` We had never met before. Now we're best friends.'' <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was a fierce storm when it rammed the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> Wednesday, killing 29 people and badly damaging the popular resort towns of <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cozumel </LOCATION>. But after making landfall again Friday in northern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> quickly lost power. It was downgraded to a tropical depression Saturday.

 Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> spun off dozens of tornadoes in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> that killed at least two people as the nearly spent storm steamed inland Saturday, a `` huge rain-making machine'' with potential for deadly flooding. Thousands of <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> residents from <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> began returning home to areas struck only a glancing blow by the main storm, at one time the most powerful on record in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>. `` What could have been one of the most deadly storms in history appears to have missed us,'' said <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>. Texans inland braced for more twisters and flash flooding, with as much as 20 inches of rain expected. A tornado Saturday evening damaged 50 homes and destroyed 15 in <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>, 150 miles west of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> and just northwest of the Mexican border, officials said. Two people were treated for minor injuries and released, but scores of others spent the night with relatives or stayed in shelters set up in the city, said police dispatcher <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was downgraded early Saturday to a tropical storm. At midday, its top sustained winds were 35 mph and it was downgraded to a tropical depression. A woman was killed Saturday when a tornado hit her mobile home south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, some 300 miles north of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>. A man died in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> when a tree toppled onto his house during a thunderstorm Friday. In <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, a man trying to cross a rain-swollen creek in <LOCATION> Tallapoosa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> southeast of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> was swept to his death early Saturday, officials said. A tornado heavily damaged a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> apartment complex just after sunrise. `` I just heard a loud, loud roar, like the wind blowing through the broken patio door in my living room,'' said <PERSON> Wes </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, whose apartment was hit. `` I just looked out, I freaked out. The roofs were gone on the buildings. Cars were tossed all over the parking lot.'' <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> also signed a disaster declaration for his city so <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> personnel could fly in parts needed to repair air conditioning at two hospitals hit by tornadoes earlier Saturday. At least 98 deaths and billions of dollars in damage were blamed on the storm in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. An additional 200 people were feared drowned after a river swollen by rain from the hurricane jumped its banks and overturned four buses Saturday in <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The storm never made an expected turn to the north and spared the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> coast, where thousands had fled to shelters after boarding up homes and businesses along the entire length of the state's 370-mile coastline. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> rolled ashore late Friday afternoon in northeastern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> with 120 mph wind about 150 miles south of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, where gusts of 82 mph were recorded at <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Padre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Swayze </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, owner of a <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> jewelry store, picked up the pieces after a twister hit her shop. `` A policeman found a diamond ring out in the parking lot,'' she said. Wind gusted to nearly 40 mph at midday at <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, but coastal residents were allowed to return to their boarded-up homes to begin cleaning up. Damage from the hurricane itself appeared to be minor. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Padre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isabel </LOCATION>, which had expected to receive the brunt of the once-fierce storm when it roared ashore, reopened to the public at noon. Other coastal cities began closing emergency shelters. `` I was surprised because I was expecting a lot of water,'' <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Campiran </PERSON>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Padre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> city manager, said Saturday. `` We have no knowledge of significant damage. Most of the damage is like roofs, windows, awnings, this kinds of stuff.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Padre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinkerton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> estimated the storm would cost local businesses $ 3 million to $ 5 million in lost tourist revenue but said he expected business to be back to normal by next weekend. Only a few low-lying coastal roads remained closed because of flooding. The greatest damage appeared to be to trees, with many uprooted or missing branches. `` It just trimmed the trees a little and that's about it,'' <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, 31, said as he cleaned up around his home. `` My neighbor back there had a tree go through a fence. We came through it real lucky.'' At 11 a.m., the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> put the storm center 220 miles west-southwest of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> and 45 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, moving toward the west-northwest at 12 mph. Tornado and flash flood watches and warnings were posted for a 26-county area of southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Inland rainfall of 10-15 inches was likely with up to 20 inches possible, forecasters said. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s remnants should bring very heavy rain to the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> before heading north up the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> as a `` huge rain-making machine,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>, meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center. In the 24 hours up to 7 a.m., <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> received 4.53 inches of rain. In <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> reported 5.7 inches in 24 hours. By midweek, the storm should be in the lower <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and end up in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> as nothing more than foul weather, forecasters said. `` The people in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> better dust off their umbrellas,'' <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON> said.

 A Tunisian diplomat has been expelled for failing to pay hundreds of dollars in parking fines, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday. The office confirmed a published report in Sunday's editions of The Mail, in which <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Eggar </PERSON> wrote that administrative attache <PERSON> Sadok </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassous </PERSON> was ordered to leave about three weeks ago as part of a crackdown on envoys who break the law. The article did not give an exact figure. The report of <PERSON> Kassous </PERSON>' departure follows the expulsion within the past week of three diplomats _ <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s ambassador, a Cuban attache and a <LOCATION> Vietnamese </LOCATION> envoy _ in connection with firearms violations In 1984 diplomats in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> failed to pay about 100,000 parking tickets, he said. The newspaper, in a separate article on the expulsion, quoted Tunisian economic attache <PERSON> Hatem </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergaoui </PERSON> as saying <PERSON> Kassous </PERSON> refused to pay the tickets because his embassy was allocated three parking spaces for six diplomats. A Foreign Office official said he did not know when <PERSON> Kassous </PERSON> left the country. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s ambassador and commercial attache were expelled Tuesday after the attache opened fire in a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> street and wounded a man. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> said he fired at a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> operative trying to get him to defect. Their expulsion came within days of a Vietnamese diplomat being ordered out for brandishing a gun at demonstrators outside his embassy.

 About 450 anti-abortion activists were arrested during demonstrations Saturday outside clinics where abortions are performed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, police said. The arrests were the latest resulting from Operation Rescue, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-based </LOCATION> organization that has spawned anti-abortion protests around the nation in recent months. Police in <LOCATION> Shrewsbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, arrested about 250 chanting and singing protesters for blocking entrances to a Planned Parenthood clinic. `` We picked Planned Parenthood because they are the McDonald's franchise of the abortion industry,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Slattery </PERSON>, a spokesman for Bi-state <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, which organized the demonstration in <LOCATION> Shrewsbury </LOCATION>, about 45 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> The Planned Parenthood in <LOCATION> Shrewsbury </LOCATION> is the only one of eight in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> that performs abortions as well as provide family planning counseling, said <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinsler </PERSON>, executive director of Planned Parenthood of <LOCATION> Monmouth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. She said the 15 or so women who had appointments for abortions for Saturday were warned of the demonstration, but none rescheduled their appointments. `` Ironically, what has happened is that these people scared away walk-ins who may have wanted birth-control devices or information,'' she said. `` At the same time, the people who wanted the abortions were there. They showed up.'' The demonstrators were taken to the <LOCATION> Shrewsbury </LOCATION> Fire Department, where they were arraigned on charges of trespassing and violating a 1984 court injunction that prohibits protests at the clinic. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, about 200 people were arrested Saturday when they surrounded the Pregnancy Consultation Center, police said. Police Chief <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said the arrest procedure was very lengthy because demonstrators were `` lifted up and carried away, which is very time consuming.'' `` We were trying to be as diplomatic as possible,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Senkir </PERSON>. `` But it's obvious these people want to be arrested.'' In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, police estimated 250 anti-abortion protesters and 50 counterprotesters demonstrated at the center, which performs abortions twice a week. `` We're just trying to prevent abortions,'' said <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Brouth </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for Operation Rescue, which claims 1,000 members in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brouth </PERSON> said 250 members and supporters surrounded the facility starting at 7 a.m. However, police later cleared a path to the back entrance for employees.

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A forecast for up to 6 inches of snow gave firefighters prospects Saturday of reinforcing battle lines against fires that have burned for nearly three months. `` This forecast is music to our ears,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Dittmer </PERSON>, one of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s area commanders. But high winds preceded the storm, with more than 40 mph gusts in some areas. Firefighters fought a fire that threatened <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> because of the winds. `` I hope this thing decides to take a nap soon,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetzinger </PERSON>, who heads a team of firefighters from <LOCATION> Brainerd </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION> `` The snow should take care of it. We sure hope so.'' The storm, forecast to swing into <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> sometime Saturday night, was expected to leave much of its moisture on the northern sections of the country's first national park, <PERSON> Dittmer </PERSON> said. Fires burning in northern <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, including the 335,300-acre <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fork </LOCATION> blaze, have been the most active in recent days and got the least moisture from a front that passed through the park a week ago, according to the commander. That previous rain represented about the first significant moisture in the park since spring. `` It could n't come to a better place,'' he said. The North Fork fire is the one that burned buildings in the tourist complex at Old Faithful geyser, and threatened <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, and park headquarters at <LOCATION> Mammoth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>. It and other fires have blackened almost half of the 2.2-million-acre park. Despite progress toward containment of the flames with fire lines, park officials declined even to venture when the blazes could be called controlled. Officials would say only that they predict the North Fork, half contained Saturday, may be fully contained sometime the middle of next month. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said showers would change to snow during the night with accumulations of 4 to 6 inches possible by Sunday morning. Daytime temperatures were expected to remain in the 40s and 50s through Wednesday, falling below freezing at night. `` It's time to break out the sweaters,'' commented park spokeswoman <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>. She said the fires did not grow Friday despite gusty winds that whipped up flames after several days of calm. Other major fires in the park included the 411,500-acre Clover-Mist fire in northeastern <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>, 75 percent contained Saturday, and the 225,500-acre Huck-Mink fire in southern <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bridger-Teton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, declared fully contained. Elsewhere, officials gave a day off to some firefighters in Glacier National Park, where a 35,000-acre fire has resisted efforts to douse it, and crews were released from another wildfire as steady rain and snow pelted much of western and central <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> Saturday. The weather bureau issued a winter storm warning for today in western and central <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, predicting up to a half-foot of snow in the foothills and a foot of snow in the mountains. High humidity and temperatures in the 40s helped firefighters in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> to keep most fires within the boundaries of the <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Church-River </PERSON> of No Return, Gospel Hump and Selway-Bitterroot wilderness areas. Still active fires had charred nearly 200,000 acres. `` The only thing consistently in our favor is winter is coming,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Zabinski </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Nez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Perce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in central <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, a $ 5,000 reward has been offered for information leading to the conviction of the person responsible for starting a forest fire that had burned 8,200 acres of the <ORGANIZATION> Willamette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> by Saturday. Investigators believe it was started by a careless hunter with a cigarette.

 A 12-year-old boy was arrested Saturday night and charged with arson for a fire that nearly destroyed a synagogue where 15 swastikas also were spray-painted, police said. Other youths were still being sought, said a police spokesman, Sgt. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>. The youth, whose name was withheld because of his age, surrendered with a parent to detectives, <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> said. He was charged as a juvenile delinquent with arson and burglary and would be released to his parents for an appearance in family court at a later date, <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> said. The fire, reported early Saturday, started on the main floor of <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congregation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rabbinical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sharai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Torah </ORGANIZATION> in the borough of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, said Sgt. <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, a police spokesman. He said the fire caused extensive interior structural damage. `` These people have violated not only the criminal law, they have violated every law of decency, and people of every religion have to be horrified that any temple of religion has been desecrated,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said a torah, a parchment scroll containing Scriptures, was set on fire, and 15 swastikas and some obscenities were spray-painted on the interior. Because the fire and desecration were declared a bias incident, a task force was formed to investigate the incident. The <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said it was offering a $ 5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and indictment of the arsonists.

The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday that federal officials have overcome major legal obstacles in their case against the deposed <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> leader and likely would ask a federal grand jury to indict him. `` I will not try to guess what the motivation is -LRB- behind the possible federal indictment -RRB-, but as I have said in the past several times and so have my lawyers _ we can prove the charges are false and we have evidence to do so,'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> responded through a spokesman. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said 35 cases are filed in a <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> court involving billions of dollars allegedly misappropriated during and after his 20-year rule. `` And so, why is there an effort to file a similar case in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> which are mere repetitions -LRB- sic -RRB- of charges pending in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>?'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> asked.

 The election campign was generally low key, with little controversy. In both major primary races, the Democrats stressed their professional backgrounds and government experience in their appeal to voters. The three Democrats who sought to unseat <PERSON> Saiki </PERSON> became known as `` The Three Amigos'' because of their general agreement on issues. They aimed most of their criticism at the first-term Republican, who gained some national exposure last month as the secretary of the Republican National Convention. <PERSON> Bornhorst </PERSON> is the front-runner among the five Democrats running for <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> mayor, according to a recent Advertiser-Channel 2 News poll. She is also leading <PERSON> Fasi </PERSON> in the poll for the general election, but <PERSON> Fasi </PERSON> was narrowing the gap and many voters were still undecided. <PERSON> Fasi </PERSON> served three terms as a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> mayor but lost in the 1980 primary.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> declared himself leader of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> Sunday after ousting Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> in a military coup. Residents reported hours of gunfire Saturday near the presidential palace. In an address on national television at 2:30 a.m. EDT, <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> said the presidential guard he commanded had toppled <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> Saturday because it was `` sickened'' by the way <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> had been governed. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, a former adviser to President <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> will respect all international treaties, liberties and human rights and said that `` dialogue will be honored for the sake of national reconciliation.'' <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> was arrested and escorted under guard to the international airport late Saturday, a government spokesman said. The <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> announced <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Franck </PERSON> <PERSON> Romain </PERSON> had requested and been granted political asylum in its <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> embassy. It said they were in the embassy and would be flown on a military plane to the capital of <ORGANIZATION> Santo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Domingo </ORGANIZATION> Sunday. The reports on <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s whereabouts could not be independently confirmed early Sunday. The government reported <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s ouster several hours after shooting broke out at the main plaza in front of the presidential palace. The gunshots sent dozens of people fleeing for cover in what appeared to be fighting between army factions, witnesses said. Earlier, <PERSON> Frantz </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s director of information, had told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> soldiers were reportedly slain during the coup, but no casualties were mentioned by <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>. Rapid gunfire continued until about 11:45 p.m. Saturday. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> has been a key figure in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s succession of governments since <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> fled to exile in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> on Feb. 7, 1986. He served as an adviser to a military-civilian junta headed by <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> which succeeded <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> was forced to resign that post in early 1986 by anti-government demonstrations. He then participated in the June 19 coup that toppled the 4-month-old civilian government of President <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>, who had tried to transfer <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> from commander of the presidential guard to an administrative post. In his speech at the national palace, <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> promoted himself to lieutenant general and said he had been forced to act. Speaking from the national palace before the presidential guard, <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> said: `` The presidential guard, sickened by the way the country has been governed since the 7th of February, 1988 ... has been forced to act again.'' <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> was named president Feb. 7, 1988. Earlier, <PERSON> Frantz </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s director of information, had told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that Dessalines Barracks Commander <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> had been named the new commander-in-chief of the army, but <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was not mentioned during the address. Behind <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was considered the most powerful figure in the military regime. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, a bespectacled, slim man of medium height, was dressed in uniform during his address. He was introduced as `` the most honest officer in the armed forces'' by Sgt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Heubreux </PERSON>, who wore full battle gear. He reference to `` dialogue'' followed a similar proposal by opposition leader <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Bazin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bazin </PERSON>, a conservative leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Understanding </ORGANIZATION>, recently said the democratic opposition and military government should meet. <PERSON> Bazin </PERSON> was one of four leading candidates for president in the aborted Nov. 29 civilian-run national elections. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON>, said early Sunday that the new government made initial contacts with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. `` The stated intentions of this new government ... were to correct the abuses of the <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> era, and to try to re-launch a period of change and progress for <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` And obviously we hope that the government will be able to carry out these intentions.'' A usually reliable source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said an army major told him that a group of officers detained <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> after preventing him from entering the palace at 4:30 p.m. Sources said the fighting involved army factions and members of the <ORGANIZATION> Tonton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macoutes </ORGANIZATION>, dreaded agents that terrorized Haitians during the 29-year-old dictatorships of the <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> family. A French diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity and <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropole </ORGANIZATION> said the shooting, including automatic gunfire, broke out around 5 p.m. Satuday on the Champ-de-Mars Plaza, in front of the Presidential Palace and near the army general headquarters and <ORGANIZATION> Dessalines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barracks </ORGANIZATION>. Several dozen panicked people were seen running away from the plaza. The coup came six days after about 20 thugs invaded the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> church during a Mass being said by the Rev. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>, a critic of the military government. The thugs, armed with guns, machetes and knifes, killed 13 people and wounded 77 and then set fire to the church as soldiers watched from across the street. That night, five men and a woman boasted on government television that they took part in the massacre and on Monday thugs burned down a second Catholic church. Some people in the St. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> church during the attack said they recognized several City Hall employees among the assailants. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s government said it `` regretted'' the killings. It has made similar statements after earlier killings but no arrests were announced.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> declared himself president of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> on Sunday after ousting the nation's leader, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>, in a military coup In an address on national television early Sunday morning, <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> said the Presidential Guard he commands had toppled <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> on Saturday because it was `` sickened'' by the way <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> had been governed. Earlier Saturday, residents reported hearing heavy gunfire near the presidential palace in what appeared to be fighting between military factions. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> was head of the armed forces, while <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> commanded the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, a 1,000-man force responsible for protecting the presidential palace. The coup came less than a week after Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, one of the most powerful storms on record, lashed <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> and killed about 30 people. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, a former adviser to President <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> will respect all international treaties, liberties and human rights and said that `` dialogue will be honored for the sake of national reconciliation.'' <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> was arrested and escorted under guard to the international airport late Saturday, a government spokesman said. The <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Franck </PERSON> <PERSON> Romain </PERSON> were granted political asylum in its embassy in <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Romain </PERSON> was a colonel in the Presidential Guard and chief of police under the <ORGANIZATION> Duvaliers </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Domingo </LOCATION> about 8:30 a.m. Sunday on a plane that landed at the private <LOCATION> Herrera </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Fabio </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>, deputy foreign minister in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> was accompanied by his wife, <PERSON> Gabrielle </PERSON>, and his daughter, <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> said. The minister said he believed <PERSON> Romain </PERSON> was still at the embassy in <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>. The Haitian government reported <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s ouster several hours after shooting broke out at the main plaza in front of the presidential palace. The gunshots sent dozens of people fleeing for cover. <PERSON> Frantz </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s director of information, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> soldiers were slain during the coup, but no casualties were mentioned by <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>. Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the fighting involved army factions and members of the <ORGANIZATION> Tonton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macoutes </ORGANIZATION>, the dreaded agents that terrorized Haitians during the 29-year-old dictatorships of the <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> family. A French diplomat who also spoke on condition of anonymity and <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropole </ORGANIZATION> said the shooting, including automatic gunfire, broke out around 5 p.m. Saturday on the Champ-de-Mars Plaza, in front of the Presidential Palace and near the army general headquarters and <ORGANIZATION> Dessalines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barracks </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> has been a key figure in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s succession of governments since <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> fled to exile in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> on Feb. 7, 1986. He served as an adviser to a military-civilian junta headed by <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> which succeeded <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> was forced to resign that post in early 1986 by anti-government demonstrations. He participated in the June 17 coup led by <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> that toppled the four - month civilian government of President <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>, who tried to transfer <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> from commander of the Presidential Guard to an administrative post In his speech to members of the Presidential Guard at the national palace, <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> declared himself president and promoted himself to lieutenant general. `` The Presidential Guard, sickened by the way the country has been governed since the seventh of February, 1988 ... has been forced to act again,'' he said. <PERSON> Lubin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dessalines </PERSON> Barracks Commander <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was named the new commander-in-chief of the army, but <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was not mentioned during <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>'s address. After <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was considered the most powerful figure in the military regime. It was not clear what role, if any, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> played in the coup. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, a bespectacled, slim man of medium height, was dressed in uniform during his address. He was introduced as `` the most honest officer in the armed forces'' by Sgt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Heubreux </PERSON>, who wore full battle gear. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON>, said early Sunday that the new government made initial contacts with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. `` The stated intentions of this new government ... were to correct the abuses of the <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> era, and to try to relaunch a period of change and progress for <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` And obviously we hope that the government will be able to carry out these intentions.'' The coup came six days after about 20 thugs invaded the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> church during a Mass being said by the Rev. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>, a critic of the military government. The thugs, armed with guns, machetes and knifes, killed 13 people and wounded 77 and then set fire to the church as soldiers watched from across the street. That night, five men and a woman boasted on government television they took part in the massacre. On Monday thugs burned down another Catholic church. Some people in the St. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> church during the attack said they recognized several City Hall employees among the assailants. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s government said it `` regretted'' the killings. It has made similar statements after earlier killings but no arrests were announced.

 Military commander <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> overthrew civilian President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> in a coup Sunday, saying it was necessary to halt deteriorating conditions in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, the state-run Radio <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> announced. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, 59, widely regarded as a hard-line officer and a right-hand man of former President <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, promised to hold multiparty elections once law and order is restored in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, the radio broadcast said. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> resigned Aug. 12 after bloody clashes between troops and unarmed protesters. Shortly after the broadcast Sunday, thousands of people surged into the streets of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> in a spontaneous rejection of the new regime and shouted for others to come out of their homes with weapons. The protesters felled trees and threw them across the roads to obstruct military traffic. But no military movements were spotted by nightfall. The coup came a day after soldiers shot at protesters marching on government buildings in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> to demand the end of 26 years of repressive rule by the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the sole legal party. The protests have been led by students and monks and included striking civil servants. <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, the defense minister and <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s fourth leader in two months, identified himself as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Restoration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. A later broadcast named the other 18 military officers in the committee, including the vice chiefs of the army, navy and air force. It said authorities imposed an immediate 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. curfew and banned public gatherings but did not specify if that was nationwide or only in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. All government and state bodies were dissolved, including local administrations nationwide, it said. All striking government workers were told to return to work by Sept. 26 or face dismissal. Nationwide protests since July have forced the resignation of two leaders and more recent strikes, demonstrations, looting and lawlessness have paralyzed the economy and pushed the nation on the verge of anarchy. The statements Sunday said the military had taken over state authority `` to curb further deterioration of the general situation in the country.'' It said military authorities would `` restore law and order, peace and tranquility in the country ... and ease the daily livelihood of the people.'' `` After accomplishing the above objectives, -LRB- the regime will -RRB- hold general elections under a multiparty system. Political parties which accept and practice true democracy can prepare for the general elections from now on.'' The broadcast said the election supervision commission formed earlier by <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s government would be retained. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, a Western-educated lawyer, on Aug. 19 became the nation's first civilian leader since the 1962 military coup that installed the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> offered general elections under a multiparty system, but demonstrators demanded an interim government to conduct the polling. There had been several signs of military resistance to the government's response to its opposition. Security forces have sided with protesters in several towns, including <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> in the southernmost <LOCATION> Mergui </LOCATION> province bordering <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. On Sept. 9, about 500 servicemen mutinied and joined protest marches in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> in the first major military defections in the capital. On Saturday, <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks and armed students took over a government building after a soldier opened fire on two protesters. The 24 soldiers inside surrendered, and the monks and students disguised them as protesters and got them past a heavily armed, 100,000-strong mob threatening to behead them. Up to 500,000 demonstrators, including striking government workers and policemen, took part n marches Saturday in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. State-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday the government had ordered soldiers to support the state and national unity. Security forces killed scores of people in quelling student-led protests in March and June. That set the stage for the July 23 resignation of Ne Win, who had ruled since he staged the 1962 military coup. More protests flared after <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, a former general, succeeded him. By government count, at least 112 people were killed in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> during the riots against <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, who resigned Aug. 12 after 17 days in power. Protesters blame the rigid socialism of the ruling party for turning resource-rich <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> into one of the poorest countries in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>One Year After Deadwood Blaze, Nature `Does Its Thing'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK WARBIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CASCADE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 While many lament the fires that have charred much of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, a wilderness that went up in smoke just one year ago already displays lush and diverse greenery that attracts herds of elk. `` The fire created more wildlife habitat than anything we could have ever done,'' <PERSON> Forest </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranger </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Huffman </PERSON> said of the Deadwood Summit fire in the <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Church-River </PERSON> of No Return Wilderness in the <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. The fire 250 miles west of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> burned more than 50,000 acres during the summer of 1987. `` It's a natural mosaic now, with open meadows and stands of timber,'' said forest spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>. `` A forest that was just getting older and deader has now been beautifully revived.'' Federal land managers, rocked by criticism of their hands-off approach to dealing with naturally sparked wildfires in wilderness areas and parks, point to Deadwood Summit as an example of a good burn. It's a tough sell. Fires this summer have charred more than 1.5 million acres in and around <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>. An early decision to let the flames go unchecked within prescribed boundaries ignited a firestorm of controversy, and <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> has said a change is likely. <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> secretary, and others have called the `` let burn'' policy a prescription for disaster, especially during the region's worst drought in decades. But while the tourist-dependent communities surrounding <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> look with apprehension at changes nature will take generations to erase, others say Deadwood Summit is, and <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> will be, an ecologically healthier place as a result of being burned. `` When fire goes through an area and turns those trees into ash, one of the things that happens is that the minerals the tree has captured during its life are returned to the soil,'' said <PERSON> Tracey </PERSON> <PERSON> Trent </PERSON>, chief of program coordination for the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> and Game. `` That really increases the productivity of the soil for a number of years after the fire.'' Or as <PERSON> Huffman </PERSON> puts it: `` It does n't take long before nature starts doing its thing.'' The Deadwood Summit fire was started by lightning on Aug. 1, 1987, about 25 air miles east of <LOCATION> Cascade </LOCATION> and three miles east of the <ORGANIZATION> Frank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> wilderness boundary. The blaze was doused by rain and snow three months later, after burning about 40,000 acres inside the wilderness and 11,500 acres elsewhere inside a 75-mile perimeter. `` The Deadwood fire in some senses is an example of how the natural fire policy can be very successful,'' <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said. `` Even though it burned longer than we predicted and got much bigger than we predicted, it actually was an outstanding fire from a forest-management standpoint.'' Today, the burned acreage is virtually covered with grass and other forage. Brush is starting to return and the area provided summer range this year to as many or more elk than before the blaze, officials said. <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gebhards </PERSON>, regional supervisor for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> and Game, said he has received reports of 150 elk or more on some meadows. That's good news for hunters, and an archery season for elk is going on as usual this month, with general elk hunting opening in the area later this fall. Before, there were uniform stands of lodgepole pine like tree farms, some of it infested with pine bark beetles like those that left thousands of acres of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> timber dead and dry. Beneath the canopy the ground was relatively barren, the smaller, more succulent plant life crowded out by the trees. Now there is the kind of diversity sought in a wilderness by land managers who try to let nature manage itself. Plants like service berry and buck brush have adapted to fire over the centuries, and some lodgepole pine cones wo n't release their seeds until they're burned. `` There's probably some pretty good arguments that maybe this year we should have done something different,'' <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said. `` But the bottom line is, nature heals itself.''

 The `` Rambo of Moon Pie eaters'' is in serious training to try to become the first man to repeat as the world champion wolfer of the sweet, gooey, Southern treats. `` I've been practicing,'' said <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazer </PERSON>, a stockman at an <LOCATION> Oneonta </LOCATION> discount store. `` I've been eating a Moon Pie every time I go on break.'' His boss, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Love </PERSON>, describes him as `` 270 pounds of rompin, stompin, genuine, 100 percent <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> Moon Pie-eating country boy who loves Moon Pies like a hawg loves slop.'' First place in the Oct. 8 contest brings $ 100, second place $ 25 and third $ 15. Last year, there were 51 contestants when <PERSON> Frazer </PERSON> won the title by eating 15 within the 10-minute limit. `` He is the Rambo of Moon Pie eaters,'' Love said. Moon Pies, made in <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, are made of a thick slab of marshmallow cream surrounded by thick coats of banana, vanilla or chocolate. `` I like the banana ones best,'' <PERSON> Frazer </PERSON> said. `` You could mix'em up in the contest but I do n't know how good they'd taste.'' A year ago he fasted a couple of days to get ready, and consumed a bunch of Rolaids after the Saturday eating bout. `` I was feeling all right by Tuesday,'' he said. `` They make you feel like you've got little bricks in you. Although a rescue squad was on hand last year, and will be again this time, `` nobody choked,'' Love said. `` A few got sick and a few did n't wait until they got away from the table. It got pretty messy right there at the end.''

<HEAD>Boudoir Photo: An Intimate Gift For the Man Who Has Everything</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some women are finding that a boudoir photo makes the perfect gift for the boyfriend or husband who has everything. At <ORGANIZATION> Design </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Binder </PERSON>, a 39-year-old insurance executive, posed for a photographer while sprawled on a black leather sofa with an emptied bottle of <PERSON> Dom </PERSON> <PERSON> Perignon </PERSON> champagne and a black mink coat on the floor. She was clad in high heels, sheer nylon stockings, garter belt and a black silk teddy with the straps hanging off her shoulders. `` I was engaged to a man who literally had everything, so for his birthday I got him this,'' she said of the photos. `` It's completely opposite of my corporate image Doing it was a fantasy for me, something very personal. `` I would recommend that any woman do it. Men, too.'' In the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area, more than 30 studios offer boudoir photography _ soft, sexy portraits to be given to boyfriends or husbands. A 1986 industry survey indicated that boudoir photography was the fastest growing segment of the business. `` It's stylized photography, a very intimate portrait of a woman,'' said photographer <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrnes </PERSON>, who took the shots of Ms. <PERSON> Binder </PERSON>. It also is definitely not a cheap gift. <PERSON> Byrnes </PERSON>, who has done this sort of work for four years, charges $ 250 or more for a session. Other <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> photographers quote prices ranging from $ 150 to $ 500. But the photographers can give customers their money's worth. Mattresses or a strategically draped sheet can be used to hide fat. After the shots are taken, retouching can eliminate stretch marks, facial puffiness and dark circles under the eyes. `` We know how to make a woman look good,'' <PERSON> Byrnes </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnur </PERSON>, a photographer at <ORGANIZATION> Furia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said customers sometimes ask him to duplicate a pin-up picture or even a shot from the Sports Illustrated swimsuit calendar. `` Others just say, ` Make me look sexy, make me look 10 years younger,''' <PERSON> Schnur </PERSON> said. Men have also started posing for their ladies and there is a trend toward portraits of couples. <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, 32, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> actress and model, said she had her picture taken embracing her boyfriend in softly erotic poses. `` Posing with my boyfriend made it more personal than posing alone,'' she said. `` The pictures captured the way we are when we're together.'' But sometimes a boudoir photo is not the perfect gift. <PERSON> Sherri </PERSON> <PERSON> Northrup </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> writer-publicist, said she paid $ 800 for a series of color shots two years ago as a St. Valentine's Day present for her husband. Ms. <PERSON> Northrup </PERSON>, now divorced, said her husband hardly reacted. `` He just kind of blew the whole thing off, like it was no big deal,'' she said. `` I should have got divorced right then and there.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> is a great writer whose works, now banned in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, should be made available in his native land, a prominent Soviet critic said in an interview published Sunday. The comments on the exiled Nobel Prize winner were made by <PERSON> Natalya </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivanova </PERSON> and printed in the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> youth daily Moskovsky Komsomolets. They were the most positive remarks on Solzhenitsyn to appear in the official Soviet press in recent memory and a further sign of an ongoing reassessment of his works. <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>, who spent eight years in labor camps under dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, wrote `` The Gulag Archipelago,'' a voluminous study of the political repression and purges that marred <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s 29-year reign. Under Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and his legacy have been sharply criticized. <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>, who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1970, was expelled from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1974 and stripped of his Soviet nationality. He now lives in <LOCATION> Cavendish </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, and is a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen. `` I consider that he is a very great writer,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ivanova </PERSON> was quoted as telling Moskovsky Komsomolets in a wide-ranging interview about contemporary Soviet literature. `` It is a great misfortune for our literature that the young generation has been deprived of the possibility of reading his books. I hope that this abnormal situation will be corrected.'' Although the greater openness fostered by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has led to the publication of once-banned works by <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasternak </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulgakov </PERSON> and other Soviet authors, <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> has so far remained off limits. The editor of the literary monthly `` Novy Mir'' has said he is negotiating for the rights to print <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>'s novel `` Cancer Ward.'' But a work such as the `` Gulag'' triology, which maintains that wide-scale political repression began in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under Soviet founder <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>, is still at odds with official ideology, which pins the blame on <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Ivanova </PERSON>, whose literary criticism regularly appears in the weekly magazine <ORGANIZATION> Ogonyok </ORGANIZATION>, also said she believed <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> should be given his Soviet citizenship back.

Former Democratic City Councilwoman <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Bornhorst </PERSON> won the right to face Republican <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fasi </PERSON> after defeating three other former council members and a community activist in Saturday's election. Voters also chose nominees for 100 federal, state and local offices. <PERSON> Bitterman </PERSON>, 44, received 51,942 votes, while <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> City Councilman <PERSON> Leigh-Wai </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo </PERSON> had 35,579 and former teachers union executive <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Radcliffe </PERSON> trailed with 15,258. <PERSON> Saiki </PERSON>, 58, was unopposed in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary for the urban <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> district. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. Spark <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>, 71, had an easy time with his little-known Democratic opponent, <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> writer <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON> gathered 180,853 votes, or 82 percent, to <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON>'s 27,360, or 12 percent, and faces Libertarian candidate <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Schooland </PERSON> in the general election Six-term <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Akaka </PERSON>, whose district includes outlying areas of <LOCATION> Oahu </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Neighbor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, was unopposed in the Democratic primary. His only competition in November will come from <ORGANIZATION> Libertarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mallan </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fasi </PERSON>, 68, received 36,608 votes, almost 90 percent, to easily defeat two relatively unknown candidates in the Republican primary. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> finished second with 1,167 votes and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirayasu </PERSON> had 1,035 votes. <PERSON> Bornhorst </PERSON>, 61, received 57,097 votes to defeat former Council members <PERSON> Patsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mink </PERSON>, <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Iwase </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, and activist <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Souza </PERSON>. Mink got 48,771, <PERSON> Iwase </PERSON> and <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> trailed with 22,906 and 21,585 votes respectively and <PERSON> Souza </PERSON> had 3,469. <PERSON> Bornhorst </PERSON>, <PERSON> Iwase </PERSON> and <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> were required by law to give up their City Council seats to run for mayor. <PERSON> Mink </PERSON> resigned her council seat two years ago when she mounted an unsuccessful campaign for governor. There was little bad blood in the two major Democratic primary races. In fact, the three Democrats who sought to unseat <PERSON> Saiki </PERSON> became known as `` The Three Amigos'' because of their reluctance to criticize each other and their general agreement on the issues. The Democrats stressed their professional backgrounds and government experience in their appeal to voters. <PERSON> Bornhorst </PERSON>, a 13-year <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> veteran, is the front-runner in the <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> mayor's race, according to a recent <ORGANIZATION> Honolulu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertiser-Channel </ORGANIZATION> 2 News poll.

<HEAD>Newly Combative Dukakis Shows Impact of Aide's Return</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had already begun to fire back at <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> before former aide <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> rejoined his campaign, but <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has become even more combative since, his sharpened rhetoric bearing the stamp of the man he likens to a brother. Exiled from the campaign a year ago, after admitting his role in the videotape that helped drive Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> from the presidential race, <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> returned to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' side two weeks ago. And the friends who gathered to welcome him back erupted in approval when he made a simple declaration: `` There are contrasts and weaknesses that are issues in this campaign. I will not shy away from pointing these contrasts out.'' All signs since, to borrow a favorite <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> phrase, indicate that <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> means it. The return of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' longtime political alter ego came at a time when the Democratic presidential nominee had lost the momentum he gained from his party's national convention and as he was being criticized for not responding aggressively to attacks from <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his fellow Republicans. `` Garbage,'' was what <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> quickly had to say about the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> attacks. Then, seeking to regain the offensive, he took aim at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his running mate, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, and audiences seemed to approve. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been around <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> a long time, but if he could n't stand up to the ayatollah or say no to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, how will he measure up to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in a speech in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. He then reminded his audience that three vice presidents have assumed the presidency within the memories of many voters. Said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is no <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>. He's no <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. And he sure ai n't <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>.'' In <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' speeches, tone and at his campaign headquarters, <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>'s stamp is obvious. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been more feisty, his staff invigorated and long-overdue channels of communication with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and key members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> established. `` It was an important development that brought our team up to full strength and we're delighted,'' said <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>, the former <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> `` Tip'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> aide who was brought in as a senior adviser to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> after <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> resigned last September. `` I think first of all his relationship with the governor is very important but also his long experience in campaigns. He's a well-respected, and deservedly so, political strategist.'' <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> was the architect of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' presidential bid, turning his eye toward the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> even as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaigned for re-election as governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> in 1986. <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> assembled the team, but was forced to leave it behind after admitting he had a role in the `` attack video'' showing <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> using the words of a British politician without attributing them. Reports based on the videotape and subsequent stories about plagiarism put <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> out of the race, but then stories about <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>'s involvement forced him from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' side. But as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign lost steam in August, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> recalled his longtime sidekick for the stretch run of his self-described marathon. <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>, whose title is vice chairman, has kept a relatively low profile since returning and declined to be interviewed about his impact. But other <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides, some speaking privately, credited him with taking a number of steps to sharpen the campaign's message and focus. `` He's gotten things moving,'' said one aide who works closely with <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>. `` The message is tightening up. The events are tightened up to help focus on that message, and the need to respond and respond quickly now has a higher priority here.'' One example came in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, just days after <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>'s return. After anti-abortion protesters disrupted his speech and became the campaign story of the day, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held an unscheduled meeting with reporters _ making sure he reclaimed a major part of the story. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides were careful to avoid belittling <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON>, who replaced <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> as campaign manager a year ago. They were unanimous in praising <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> for her stewardship in the tumultuous period after <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> resigned and for her handling of his return, which has reduced her role in plotting strategy somewhat but also allowed her to do what many in the campaign believe she does best _ dissect issues. `` It's been a win-win situation,'' a senior <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide said. One asset <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> brought with him was the power to win <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> over. <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>, for one, was urging <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to respond aggressively to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attacks. The cautious <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> initially resisted and was just beginning to show signs of aggressiveness when <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> was called back _ in effect an admission by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> that it was time to turn up the heat. `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> listens to <PERSON> John </PERSON> in a way he does n't listen to others,'' said one of the aides who commented only on condition he not be named. <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> also has extensive contacts in Democratic circles from his 1984 job as manager of <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>'s vice presidential campaign. <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> was his deputy then and both were involved in the decision to ask <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON>, who played <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>'s debate rehearsals, to play the same role this week as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> begins in earnest his preparations for his first debate with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Pearl Harbor Just One in Bush's Blooper List</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Blame it on long campaign days with multiple stops, jet lag, or whatever. Bloopers are becoming a standard feature of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s stump speeches. `` You ought to vote for me. I knew about <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> three months before it happened,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> joked last week, trying to take the edge off his mistake about the date of the Japanese attack that led <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> into World War II. He had said it was on Sept. 7 instead of Dec. 7. Since that foulup, it seems that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> slips in every speech. `` I hope I stand for anti-bigotry, anti-Semitism, anti-racism,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in one. `` That is what drives me.'' Later, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sent his press secretary out to make sure reporters knew he did not mean to say he stands for anti-Semitism. Tripping over his oft-stated goal of full employment, the Republican presidential nominee said he wanted to ensure that `` everybody who has a job wants a job.'' Usually candidates do n't try to improvise on the Pledge of Allegiance, but that's what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides say he was doing at an appearance last week after reporters suggested he had stumbled over the words. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has tried to wrap his campaign in patriotism, said the flag was the symbol of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and then continued `` and to the liberty for which it stands, one nation, under God with freedom and justice for all. And let's never forget it.'' If he was trying to use the words of the pledge, he should have said, `` and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.'' On the same day, he referred back to January 1981 when he was sworn in with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Giving himself a promotion, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Ten days before I was sworn in as president. ...'' In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> with Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> at his side, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> apparently forgot that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had been a two-term governor of the state. Referring to <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` He will go down in my book as THE great governor'' of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tried to poke holes in <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' boasts about the economy in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Inadvertently, he gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> some campaign ammunition by incorrectly stating the record. His speech text said that <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, under <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, had lost 26,000 manufacturing jobs and was `` one of the biggest manufacturing job losers in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' But that's not the way <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said it. Reading from a device that scrolled his speech in front of his eyes, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> dropped the word `` manufacturing'' in two separate references. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' staff pounced on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> because although the state has lost manufacturing jobs, it has added about 230,000 jobs overall. Over breakfast at a <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> restaurant in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made three gaffes in a matter of minutes. He said his Mexican-born daughter-in-law `` became a citizen so she could vote for her grandfather ... her, uh, father-in-law.'' He referred to Republican Rep. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> as a congressman from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> _ not <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. And he referred to the oldtime `` Dragnet'' television series character <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> Friday as `` senator'' before he corrected it to `` sergeant.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said last week that when he makes a mistake, he's fair game for attack by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ and vice versa. `` We'll foul up and he'll jump on me, and he'll make some mistakes and I'll jump on him, but the thing is to get the issues out there so the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people can see them. `` Once in a while you do get sore; once in a while you might get a little tense, but you know when you make a mistake like that, I expect somebody to jump on me. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> did it. It did n't bother me. <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> did it and that did n't bother me.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also acknowledged that some staff members did n't want him to meet with reporters, one reason being his occasional gaffes. `` It's just some lower level hand-wringers who think I'm going to screw up,'' he said.

 From the turret of an <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> tank in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> to a union hall in <LOCATION> Republican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> fought all last week to regain the initiative in the presidential race. `` It was really a good week,'' he told reporters on the long flight Saturday night from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to the nation's capital. A good week had been a long time coming. Aides to the Democratic presidential candidate readily conceded the race had changed dramatically during the past month, with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> enjoying a surge. Gone were those double-digit leads <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> once held in national polls. Gone also was the sense some had had that he was a near certain bet to win back the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION> for the Democrats. Presidential campaigns can turn on which candidate is more successful at setting the issues agenda and defining the public perception of the contenders. For the past month, voters have learned more about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> from Republican <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his allies than they did from the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate. They have received a picture of a <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> liberal who vetoed legislation to require recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools, of a governor who supported allowing convicts to have weekend furloughs from prison, of someone who opposed most major weapons systems. The past week, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> set out to alter that image, to `` sharpen the message,'' as his aides put it. He sought to counter the charge that he is weak on defense by riding in the turret of a tank and by delivering a speech decidedly hawkish _ for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ in tone. The emphasis in his speech at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> was on the weapons systems he favors _ the Trident II, the Stealth bomber, a new fighter and a new attack submarine. Then he flew to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> where the emphasis was on fighting crime and drugs as well as on the environment. His speeches contained more specifics _ doubling the number of drug enforcement agents and elevating the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to Cabinet status. It was clear the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign had decided it was time to make clear what he stands for. `` In most of the country, voters do n't know who <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is,'' said <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, a senior campaign adviser. No one summed that up better than <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the week before the Republican National Convention, when he dubbed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> the `` Stealth candidate,'' a reference to the experimental plane designed to evade radar detection. It was a jibe at a candidate who had avoided laying out specific proposals on many major questions and had directed his party to come up with a non-specific platform. For those who saw Democrats unduly burdened by past promises to a variety of interest groups, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' strategy seemed right. But as the fall campaign opened it gave the Republicans an opportunity to be the first to give voters a picture of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Suddenly, the talk within the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign was of the need for `` a good solid message.'' `` It would have been better had he spoken up a little more sharply, a little sooner,'' said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Podesta </PERSON>, who is running the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The Republican attacks were relentless and at most stops <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> found himself pressed to respond. He often resisted, reluctant to get into extended negative campaigning. But he could n't remain silent. `` We ca n't let them, we ca n't let <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his aides lay charges on us that we do n't answer,'' said <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>. While he sometimes appeared reluctant to respond to the vice president, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was not shy about going on the attack. He repeatedly linked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> always describes as the `` drug-peddling Panamanian dictator'' and said the vice president had provided `` zero protection for the environment.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' sense that he was having a good week was helped by the reports of rhetorical gaffes by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his running mate, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> does n't know what century he's in and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ca n't remember the Pledge of Allegiance,'' he told a delighted partisan crowd in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Omnibus Spending Bill Is Possible, Despite Last Winter's Pledges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Remember President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s nationally televised pledge last January to veto future catchall spending bills like the $ 600 billion behemoth <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> sent him last year, and the promises by scores of lawmakers from both parties not to do it again? Guess what may be about to happen. As the Oct. 1 start of the 1989 fiscal year approaches, increasing numbers of senators and representatives, and their aides, concede that an omnibus spending bill looms as a real possibility. It would n't be as large as last year's. After all, two of the 13 individual appropriations bills that finance the government have already been signed into law, and four others have been sent to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for his signature. But with the presidential campaign influencing much of what happens in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> these days, and with the hopper stuffed with legislation <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wants to pass before leaving town next month, a catchall spending bill may well be the result. `` I do n't see any way out of that scenario right now,'' Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, a ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said recently. Everyone agrees that come Oct. 1, a short-term omnibus bill is virtually unavoidable, providing financing for a week or two for all agencies for which money has not yet been provided for the new fiscal year. But if spending legislation is not finished by the time <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourns in mid-October, lawmakers would likely either pass another omnibus bill to tide the government over until <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> returns in January, or send the president a package of all remaining appropriations bills and dare him to veto it. The engine that would drive such a measure would be defense. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has already vetoed a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget bill containing arms control language and cuts in the `` Star Wars'' missile defense system, a rejection that was interpreted as an effort to make defense an issue in the presidential campaign. Many lawmakers still support those provisions. If <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the White House can not work out a compromise _ or if they send a measure to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and he vetoes it again _ a catchall bill would be born, consisting of the defense spending bill and other unsigned measures. `` There could be a situation, if we run into a problem on the defense appropriations bill, in which there would have to be a continuing resolution in the final analysis,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, using the congressional term for catchall spending legislation, warned his colleagues two weeks Rep. <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>, D-Calif., a member of both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> and Appropriations Committees, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` thinks he's created an issue They may figure they can rekindle it by vetoing an appropriations bill.'' Some Democrats say one scenario would be to send the president a package of bills containing the defense legislation and other spending measures, thus making it painful for the president to exercise a veto and eliminating another opportunity for Republicans to raise the defense issue. `` He threw us a curve by vetoing that defense bill,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON>, D-Ore., a member of the defense appropriations subcommittee `` No one down <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Avenue should be surprised if we use every strategy in the book to launch that curve out of the ballpark.'' However, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' Democratic leadership has vowed repeatedly this year to try to send <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> 13 separate spending bills by the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year. Few lawmakers have forgotten the president's State of the Union address of Jan. 25, when he hoisted thick stacks of spending and tax bills that were months overdue and said, `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should n't send another one of these And if you do, I will not sign it.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> accused lawmakers of trying to force him to accept excessive spending, while <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> blamed the president for being so intractable for so long that lawmakers had no other choice. Nonetheless, dozens of senators and representatives signed letters chastising the use of omnibus spending bills, a belief that many retain. `` They make <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as an institution look bad,'' says Rep. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Penny </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Minn </LOCATION>., a perennial opponent of omnibus spending measures For his part, the president is standing firm on his words of last January. `` I hope <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will watch my lips here: I want 13 separate bills,'' he said Friday. Whatever happens, that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has gotten even this far is a remarkable feat for an institution that is a notorious budget laggard. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed all 13 appropriations bills this year before July 1, the first time that had happened since 1960. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has n't approved all 13 appropriations bills separately since fiscal 1977.

 <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> says he's enjoying the quiet life in retirement, sitting in the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> sun and watching the robins on his windowsill. But his mind, of late, has been back in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, reliving past battles on the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION>. What he remembers is n't at all flattering to those who served with him, and what he sees for the future is n't always reassuring. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>, as always, is still speaking bluntly. At age 79, <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> has written another book, reflecting on his 30-year career as a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> senator, his 1964 Republican presidential bid, and the people and events he encountered along the way. `` <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>,'' written with <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Casserly </PERSON>, will be published by <PERSON> Doubleday </PERSON> on Oct. 12. `` Nostalgia for the old days and other times rises like the sun most of my mornings,'' <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> says. `` But in the evening, when the cool desert air refreshes my spirit, my blood flows faster and I shake my fist at the present.'' Considering his outspoken words, <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> must have written most of his book in the evening, with his blood flowing. Neither Democrats nor Republicans are spared: PRESIDENT <PERSON> REAGAN </PERSON>: `` I believe <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did know of the diversion of Iranian funds to the Contras. He had to know. The White House explanation makes him out to be either a liar or incompetent.'' SENATE REPUBLICAN LEADER BOB DOLE: `` <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> does n't have the leadership qualities that his job as minority leader requires. He tries to make everybody happy. That ca n't be done. I and other Republicans were unable to harden his hide. The <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator must become tough if he is ever to become a leader.'' SENATE DEMOCRATIC LEADER <PERSON> ROBERT </PERSON> <PERSON> BYRD </PERSON>: `` One day I see <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor and did n't recognize him. His face was covered with pancake makeup that ran down his starched collar. His hair was stylishly fluffed. He looked like he was about to step on stage in some nightclub act. I took one look, walked back to my seat, sat down and waited for him to pull out his fiddle.'' PRESIDENT <PERSON> NIXON </PERSON>: `` <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> was the most dishonest individual I have ever met in my life. He lied to his wife, his family, his friends, his colleagues in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, lifetime members of his own political party, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, and the world.'' Election junkies will be disappointed if they expect similar observations on the candidates in this year's presidential election. Fellow senators <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominees, are not discussed at all. The name <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appears one, fleeting time, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> not at all. <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>, however, has something to say about the Democratic and Republican parties as they head into the November elections. _ DEMOCRATS are `` rethinking the fundamental meaning of liberalism and simply have no new direction or programs to use in redirecting their energies. Looking beyond 1988, `` the Democrats will come back strong about the year 2000 or shortly thereafter. But it will be a new <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> largely because of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.'' _ REPUBLICANS `` do n't have to become more centrist, but it's certain the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> has to accommodate and balance a wider variety of opinions and political We must become more a party of inclusion.'' Referring to the New Right and its moral agenda, <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> said, `` We began walking separate roads, however, when the New Right began pushing special social agendas involving legitimate legal, religious and other differences. I support much of what they say, but not at the risk of compromising constitutional rights.'' Despite criticism of the Iran-Contra scandal and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s choices of Adm. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> as national security adviser and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> to be his White House chief of staff, <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> calls <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` the most inspirational president I have seen,'' edging out <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who `` inspired the nation. <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> is less inspired by the growing federal and congressional bureaucracies. `` The colossus we continue to construct in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is now being threatened from within,'' he says. `` The large staffs created to help <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are now beginning to control it. I've long asked the question: Who the hell is running <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, we or the staffs?'' While <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> is optimistic that the world will solve problems of population, hunger and disease, he says communism `` is the world's greatest danger'' and `` the seeds of future global conflict have unmistakably already been sown. A Third World War is not unthinkable.'' For 51 of his nearly 80 years, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> drew support from his wife, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON>, who died in 1985, and he remembers her with pain and poignancy in the book dedicated, simply, `` To <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON>.'' After her death, `` I phoned her four or five times every day for months after returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The phone would ring and ring. Then her memory would fall away and my face would collapse into my hands. The healing process has been slow and painful.'' If the title had n't already been taken for a book about <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> could have called his book `` Plain Speaking.'' As he says at the beginning, `` these recollections are straight from the shoulder _ a last salute before the flag is lowered and the final notes of taps fade into memory. A man stands up, says his piece, then sits down. Others must judge his deeds.''

 Nearly three out of four juveniles in youth correctional facilities come from broken homes and nearly half were under the influence of drugs or alcohol when they committed their offense, a government study reported Sunday. The study found that nearly 60 percent of the 18,226 juveniles in the long-term, state-operated institutions during 1987 used drugs regularly, once a week or more for at least a month. Seventy-two percent of the boys and girls under 18 said they had not grown up with both parents. About half of all the juveniles surveyed said they had lived primarily with their mothers. More than half of the juveniles reported that a family member had also been imprisoned at least once. The report by the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agency, was based on interviews with a nationally representative sample of 2,621 residents of 50 youth correctional institutions administered by 26 states. `` The study found that many of the juvenile offenders had criminal histories that were just as extensive as those of adults in state prisons,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>, director of the bureau. About 39 percent of the juveniles had been incarcerated for violent crimes, and nearly 43 percent had been arrested more than five times. More than 16 percent of the juveniles were institutionalized for an assault, 13 percent for robbery and 6 percent for a rape or other sexual assault. Twenty-three percent said they were under the influence of both drugs and alcohol at the time they committed the offense that led to their incarceration. According to the survey, 15.7 percent said they were under the influence of only drugs at the time of the offense, and 8.7 percent of alcohol only. More than 93 percent of the juveniles were male, and 52.5 percent were white, 41.4 percent were black and 6.1 percent were American Indians, Asians, Alaskan natives or <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islanders </ORGANIZATION>. An estimated 14.5 percent were of Hispanic background.

 Eight boxes of correspondence and memos from the Peoples Temple commune at <LOCATION> Jonestown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION>, where 913 people died in a mass suicide 10 years ago, have become available for scholarly review. Among the documents are dozens of scribbled notes from members suggesting methods of taking revenge on people who defected from the group, proposals that included selling them poisoned Christmas candy. The records, unsealed by a court-appointed receiver and deposited recently at the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, reveal the bizarre mental states of members of the Peoples Temple. In a group of letters to the Rev. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, leader of the religious cult and mastermind of the suicide on Nov. 18, 1978, some members vowed to kill themselves and their children on command. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' aides wrote memos to him on how sleep deprivation and Vitamin B complex deficiency are useful tools in brainwashing. After a `` suicide drill'' at the jungle settlement, one member wrote to <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>: `` Sex, drugs, nor wine could take what took place this evening. I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to go through the process of dying. Just sitting there looking at the line of people, young and old alike, eager to get it over with.

The new documents also reveal that <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Marceline </PERSON>, challenged him during the summer of 1978. When talk of mass suicide became a temple obsession, she pleaded with him in a letter to spare the children. One woman said she would kill herself if <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, whom she called `` Father,'' wanted it. But she added that she still wanted to `` write some short stories, even poetry ... plant rows of vegetables. And I would like to raise a kitten.''

 A majority of Americans favor financial assistance for family planning programs in rapidly growing nations, according to a new poll done for a pair of population groups. Sixty percent of adults polled by <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should fund foreign family planning programs, regardless of whether abortion is legal in those nations. But more than one-third of Americans, 34 percent, disagreed, according to the poll prepared for the <ORGANIZATION> Population </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crisis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the Planned Parenthood Federation of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Providing financial support for family planning has been a bone of contention in recent years, with the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> withdrawing support from countries where abortion is a part of the programs. The agency halted funding to both the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planned </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parenthood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION>'s Population Fund, contending that their policies promoted coercive abortion. The two independent population groups paid for the poll of 1,250 Americans in order to gauge the support for family planning in this presidential election year. A poll of that size has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The study concluded that Americans are aware that the world's population _ which last year topped the 5 billion mark _ is growing rapidly and that this poses many problems Some 91 percent of those polled think food shortages and famines will get worse if populations in poor countries continue their rapid increases, the study found. Continued population growth will lead to more illegal immigration to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to 89 percent of the respondents, while 87 percent predicted that there will be more international crises and that more agricultural land will turn to desert and 69 percent foresee more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jobs moving overseas. Asked if the poor countries of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> should have strong birth control programs, 89 percent agreed. Fifty-nine percent said such programs are in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' interest, and 60 percent approved <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> money for the programs

 Nearly four years after radon from his house caused <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Watras </PERSON> to set off radiation detectors at the <LOCATION> Limerick </LOCATION> nuclear power plant, he wonders daily about his family's health `` There's a fine line between making yourself sick by worrying and having a genuine concern and doing the best you can,'' said <PERSON> Watras </PERSON>, 37, a technical adviser at the plant. Radon levels in <PERSON> Watras </PERSON>' home of 800 times the concentration deemed hazardous first alerted environmental officials and residents of southeastern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> to the danger of indoor radon concentration. Last week, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the problem is more widespread than previously believed and urged that every home in the country be tested. Radon is a radioactive gas produced by the natural decaying of uranium found in all soil and rock and usually dissipated harmlessly into the atmosphere. It poses a health threat when it seeps through the ground and collects in homes. The colorless, odorless gas could be responsible for 20,000 of the nation's 130,000 annual lung cancer deaths, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimates. It kills by leaving its own radioactive decay products in the lung, irradiating the organs for a lifetime. Environmental officials first believed radon to be concentrated along a geological formation known as the Reading Prong, a narrow area of high-uranium soil stretching from Reading, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, across northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state. But a recent <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> survey in seven states and Indian land found health-threatening levels of radon in 29 percent of 11,000 homes tested. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has set 4 picocuries of radon per liter of air as a guideline for determining when long-term exposure poses a health threat. A picocurie is a measure of radiation. Exposure to 15 picocuries of radon for a lifetime is equivalent to smoking a pack of cigarettes a day, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> says. A reading taken in the living room of <PERSON> Watras </PERSON>' modest, split-level house in December 1984 was 3,200 picocuries, the highest ever recorded at a private home. <PERSON> Watras </PERSON>, his wife and two young children were evacuated soon afterward. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON>, administrator of the state Radon Monitoring Program set up several miles away in late 1985, said the Watrases' house was built inches above uranium-laden granite. `` He just had an ungodly concentration of radon spewing into his home,'' <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Watras </PERSON> and his family returned to the house in August 1985 after a $ 32,600 research project dramatically reduced the radon level. <PERSON> Watras </PERSON> and his wife have since had a third child. `` At the beginning, we were saying, ` Why us?' We were looking at the children saying, ` What did we do to you?''' <PERSON> Watras </PERSON> recalled in an interview at his home last week. <PERSON> Watras </PERSON> now believes <PERSON> God </PERSON> put his family in the home for a purpose. `` What we've got to do from now on is try to help other people,'' he said, calling his efforts to bring attention to radon `` a crusade.'' Some of the other residents in his suburban <LOCATION> Berks </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> neighborhood, nicknamed <LOCATION> Radon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, agree with him and have organized to push for legislation protecting homes from the toxic gas. Others believe the threat is overblown. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who lives down the street from <PERSON> Watras </PERSON>, is president of <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvanians </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radon </ORGANIZATION>, a group with about 150 members. Ms. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> believes national building codes should include radon guidelines, wants public service advertisements that warn people about the danger of radon and supports a law that would force a family to leave a home when radon levels reach a certain point. Unless the government acts, people will forget about radon as media interest wanes, she said. `` Right now, everything you pick up, it's radon, radon, radon, but in two or three days it's going to die out,'' Ms. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, another neighbor, is one of those skeptical about the radon threat. `` I do n't think I'm walking into a gas chamber when I walk into my home. I'd like to think something else will get me before the radon,'' said <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, a 34-year-old machinist at a chemical plant. <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> has n't measured the radon level in his home, and he said environmental officials have n't been able to convince him that the problem ca n't be alleviated by opening a few windows. No records exist of the number of people who have had their homes refitted in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> to reduce the amount of radon in the air. <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON> estimated the number was in the thousands, most of them along the Reading Prong, where 60 percent of the homes tested had levels above 4 picocuries. Even when houses have been fixed, health worries remain. `` The fear never goes away,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, whose family spent five years in a home that recorded a radon level of 450 picocuries before being fitted with a ventilation system. `` We're living in the unknown.''

 Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> awarded his latest Golden Fleece award to the Urban Mass Transit Administration for sending government officials to <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> to learn how to motivate employees, his office said Sunday. The September installment of the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Democrat's monthly award for wasteful federal spending was for a four-day seminar that cost the agency $ 68,160. `` UMTA apparently hopes that by sending mass transit officials from around the country to <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Minnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON>, Goofy, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs will help them find out how to make transit employees whistle while they work,'' <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> said in a written statement. Attending the Sept. 6-9 session in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, were six top <ORGANIZATION> UMTA </ORGANIZATION> officials _ including its chief, <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> DelliBovi </PERSON> _ and 47 local mass transit officials from around the country. The officials paid their own travel expenses, but <ORGANIZATION> UMTA </ORGANIZATION> picked up the tab for the $ 110 per night hotel rooms and the $ 795 program fee for each. `` This is an idea Dopey would have loved, but it's likely to make taxpayers feel like Grumpy,'' the senator said. <ORGANIZATION> UMTA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON> said Friday that agency officials are worried that only 2.8 per cent of all travel by Americans is made on mass transit, the lowest percentage since the government began making the estimate 20 years ago. <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON> said the trip served two purposes: To allow officials to learn how <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> officials motivate their workers and to examine the amusement park's huge transportation system. Both would provide helpful lessons for agencies trying to boost ridership, he said. `` It was a perfectly legitimate effort to convince public transit authorities that there are ways to attract new riders,'' <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON> said. `` Government would do well to draw on the experience of successful private companies.'' The seminar, called `` The Disney Approach to <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>,'' was also attended by executives from private industry, <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, however, said he doubted that allowing government officials to `` frolic in the Magic Kingdom with federal dollars'' would prove helpful. `` Instead of a trip to <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>, maybe mass transit officials can improve employee morale by wearing <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON> ears around bus yards,'' he said. `` It would cost far less, and it would probably accomplish as much as this wasteful trip.''

 When presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> addresses Hispanic voters in their own language, <ORGANIZATION> Cables </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> can broadcast his words untranslated on its new Spanish-language program. The language spoken by one-eighth of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population has become part of the daily newsroom hum at the Headline News studios in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, as <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> enters its fourth month of producing `` Noticiero Telemundo-CNN.'' `` It's a very ambitious undertaking for <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> to have gotten into,'' said the program's executive producer, <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON>. `` And they're going full steam ahead. It's sort of like the sky's the limit right now.'' The twice-daily, half-hour newscast premiered in May with on-scene coverage of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit. It is the first time a major Enlish-language news organization has entered the growing Spanish-language television market. But <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>'s Spanish product is shown in this country on 18 Spanish-language stations owned by or affiliated with <ORGANIZATION> Telemundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> network based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> also sold the program in eight Latin American countries. Its main competitor is the newscast produced by <ORGANIZATION> Univision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Spanish-language broadcast system that has been around for some 25 years. The 25-member bilingual staff shares <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>'s Headline News studio in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and has access to the cable networks' English-language news gathering resources worldwide. `` The resources of 1,600 <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> employees around the world are available for them to use in Spanish if they choose,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayworth </PERSON>, spokesman for the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>. However, May stresses that the newscast is not just a translation of <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>'s English product. `` We've hired our own journalists _ everything from editors to writers to anchors to reporters,'' she said. `` There's not a translator on my staff.'' Numbering more than 20 million, Hispanic Americans have become the fastest growing minority market in the country. Among the half who understand English, more than 50 percent still spend most of their time watching Spanish-language television, according to a survey cited in the trade journal Television-Radio Age. Advertisers spent $ 223 million on Spanish-language television last year, up 23 percent from 1986 and nearly double the $ 118 million spent in 1984, the journal reported. `` There is obviously an important and large and affluent marketplace of Spanish-speaking Americans,'' <PERSON> Hayworth </PERSON> said. Though <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> has n't been on the air very long in <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION>, <PERSON> May </PERSON> said she's pleased with the results of its first summer. `` We're ecstatic about the fact that we've kept up our audience share and ratings in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' she said, adding that the program also has been doing well in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, other cities with large Hispanic populations. `` We try to do stories that we feel would really affect the Hispanics ... most things related to health, children, education _ the dropout rate is a major problem among Hispanics,'' said May, a native of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Gestoso </PERSON>, a co-anchor of the program, said it's important for Hispanic journalists to see world events through the eyes of their audience. `` When we covered the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>, we tried to focus on how what they were saying could affect the lives of Hispanics,'' said <PERSON> Gestoso </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>. `` It's vital, it's essential to have Spanish language news. The audience is very different _ at least a portion of them speak only Spanish or very little English,'' he said. `` There's a vital need to let them understand what's going on in the world.''

<HEAD>Congress Considers Raising Minimum Wage This Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When their party regained control of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> two years ago, liberal Democrats placed at the top of their agenda raising a minimum wage that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> claimed had `` caused more misery and unemployment than anything since the Great Depression.'' With only seven weeks remaining until voters pick <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s successor, his former running mate and GOP-designated heir, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, may have waffled just enough on the issue in the past two weeks for Democrats to push through the first increase in the $ 3.35 an hour wage base in eight years <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> figures indicate that a raise to $ 4.55 by 1991 as proposed by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> would directly benefit some 15 million workers now paid less than that amount. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said again last Friday that he could support a modest increase _ less than the $ 1.20 an hour over three years that <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> have agreed upon _ but only if it is coupled with a lower `` training wage.'' Key Senate Republicans such as <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> predicted that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s slight shift to muted support for a wage increase will cause many <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers to reconsider their opposition with or without the training wage. The training wage is the latest <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> euphemism for a subminimum wage, a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> idea that went nowhere when the administration proposed it year after year during his first term but that succeeded in taking the steam out of a push for an minimum wage increase. To quote <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, R-Ind., paraphrasing <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> basketball coach <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>: `` There is nothing that a good defense can not beat a better offense In other words, a good offense wins.'' But with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> expected to complete action on the minimum wage this week followed by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> action the next week, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and congressional Republicans are stuck on defense. The latest Gallup Poll on the issue on June 19 showed 76 percent public support for raising the minimum wage by 50 percent to $ 5.05 over the next four years, with only 28 percent opposition. Even Republicans who were polled favored the raise by 67 percent to 30 percent. The raise to $ 5.05 over four years is the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic version of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s increase to $ 4.55 over three years in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. House leaders already have indicated they will abandon their proposal in favor of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version. As a Republican counter, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> _ who has led the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> opposition to a minimum wage increase the past 7 -LCB- years _ in July offered a 65-cent raise over two years to $ 4 an hour, coupled with a lower training wage. Republicans, however, declined to push for a vote on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s amendment in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> then, saying they preferred to wage the battle on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the Republican campaign have declined to specify what they want in a minimum wage package, Sen. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON>, R-Minn., said he will introduce <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s $ 4 minimum wage as an amendment this week And Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, has a pending amendment on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor to establish a `` training'' wage that would pay any new hire 80 percent of the minimum wage for the first 90 days he or she is on an employer's payroll. But because Democrats control the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>'s proposal may never get a direct vote. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> offered a substitute that would slightly expand coverage of an 85 percent subminimum wage _ currently $ 2.85 an hour _ for full-time students that is now in the law. About 100,000 students are paid that subminimum. If <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s parliamentary gambit works and a majority supports his subminimum proposal, Republicans may be precluded from ever getting a yea-or-nea vote on their training wage. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> expressed doubts last week that he would prevail. But with many lawmakers in both parties taking last Friday off to campaign for re-election, he succeeded in delaying any votes until at least Tuesday when presumably all will have returned. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, meanwhile, welcomed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vague support for any kind of minimum wage increase. `` I only wish that he had spoken up sooner,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said, returning to his `` Where was <PERSON> George </PERSON>?'' theme at the Democratic National Convention. `` I must say that his silence has been deafening during debate on this bill.'' Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to vote Monday evening on a U.S.-Canada trade agreement that would phase out all tariffs between the two countries over 10 years. The House in August approved the agreement negotiated by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. But its anticipated passage by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and then signature by the president does not mean that it will go into effect soon. The bill authorizes <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to implement the agreement next Jan. 1. But it has been approved by only one of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s two legislative bodies. If Canadian Prime Minister Brain <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, as expected, calls new parliamentary elections in the next two or three weeks, legislation there implementing the accord could die in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> A new parliament would then have to start from scratch on enacting the agreement.

 A forest fire that swept out of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> threatened a fir tree inscribed by western showman <PERSON> Buffalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cody </PERSON>, and his grandson feared the worst for his namesake's landmark. But it survived even though trees 6 feet away were burned. `` You talk about a miracle. I'll say it was,'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cody </PERSON> said. The fir tree's 4-foot-thick trunk was inscribed `` Camp Monaco 1913'' when <PERSON> Buffalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> was host to Prince <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Monaco </LOCATION> on a hunting trip in the Shoshone National Forest. <PERSON> Cody </PERSON>'s famous Wild West show was a hit in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` It was about this time of year when <PERSON> Granddad </PERSON> took the prince up there,'' <PERSON> Cody </PERSON> said. He had been worried about the tree ever since the Clover-Mist fire surged into the North Fork drainage about two weeks ago, but a helicopter flight over the area with <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> rangers confirmed the tree was safe. Camp <ORGANIZATION> Monaco </ORGANIZATION> is a half day's horseback ride from <LOCATION> Pahaska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tepee </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Buffalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>'s hunting lodge near <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>'s east entrance. <PERSON> Cody </PERSON> said he had been considering attempting to salvage the inscription if the tree burned, but he started to fear the worst when he saw from the air how much damage the fire had caused. `` It was a disaster all the way up the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fork </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 One week before their high-stakes debate, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> took Sunday off before heading into a week of reduced campaigning amid intense preparation for their first televised confrontation before a national audience. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in brief remarks to reporters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said he'd `` done all the homework'' for the debate but still planned to work later in the week on preparing for it <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who was out of the public eye in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, also planned to ease off on his recently full-speed campaign travels later in the week to concentrate on getting ready for the debate. Meanwhile, Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, a top-ranking <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrat, defended the party's nominee against recent attacks by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other Republicans. In particular, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> took the Republicans to task for their criticism of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' veto of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> legislation that would have required teachers to lead classes in the Pledge of Allegiance. `` There is no greater phony issue that's been raised in this campaign,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>.'' He said, `` In <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the pledge means something because we say it freely. ... We are not forced to do so.'' Rep. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, a co-chairwoman of the national <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, criticized <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> for linking the issue to loyalty oaths in <LOCATION> Nazi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. She said such comments show why the issue `` is working against <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and should.'' As for next Sunday's debate in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, the first of two presidential confrontations before the Nov. 8 election, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I think I've done the homework. It's like a ballgame, getting up for it, mentally up and physically up.'' The vice president, speaking with reporters after attending church services, said he planned to work this week on preparing for the debate `` but not today. It's Sunday, a day off. I'm going to get a little exercise and count my blessings.'' Monday morning campaign appearances in the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> area, a Tuesday visit to a flag manufacturing company in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and a joint appearance with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Thursday in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> were <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s only scheduled trips for the week. The vice president said he did n't expect to visit areas in southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> damaged by Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>. He said of the hurricane, `` It's a sad thing. Fortunately, it was less strong when it hit. But still there is a lot of heartache.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who spent most of last week on the road, giving major speeches on foreign and military policy, also planned to concentrate on getting ready for the debate during the coming week. Still, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, who returned home only Saturday night, was to embark on a campaign trip to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> on Monday. The vice presidential running mates, Democrat <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, also were off the campaign trail on Sunday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who attended services at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, an Episcopal church on <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> across from the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, with his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, answered several questions afterward. Asked about the military coup in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, he said, `` It's too early to say what happened.'' But he added, `` We want democracy for <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, for the whole of the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and for the whole of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' He said such a trend appears to be occurring in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` with some visible exceptions.'' Asked if he favored a resumption of talks with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s leader Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would say only, `` We want democracy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'' as well as through the rest of the region. On another television talk program, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had asked him on two occasions if more could be done to fight acid rain than was called for by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policies. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press,'' said, `` At least twice, individually with me, he pulled me aside on the issue of acid rain and asked if we could do more _ and frankly at that point in time, I did n't think we should _ than where we were going on that problem.'' He did not say when the inquiries occurred. In the campaign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said, `` I am an environmentalist,'' and has said there were many occasions when he argued within the councils of the administration for more environmental protection. He says he will back a program to reduce emissions of one major raw material for acid rain, sulfur dioxide from smokestacks, by unspecified millions of tons. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> has supported the administration's position that not enough is known about the effects of acid rain to justify a major emissions reduction program, and that more research is needed. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Saturday said he would elevate <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to the status of a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> department. Meanwhile, a new poll suggested <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has overtaken <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, a key state in which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had once led by 10 percentage points. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Akron </ORGANIZATION> poll, commissioned by The -LRB- <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> -RRB- Beacon Journal, WKYC-TV in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and WCMH-TV in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, indicated that 43 percent of the registered voters checked in the survey favored <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to 39 percent for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and 18 percent undecided. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s lead was within the poll's margin of potential sampling error _ four points in either direction. The poll was conducted by telephone among 667 registered voters between Sept. 6 and last Thursday.

 <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chrysler </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, an art collector and museum benefactor whose father founded <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, has died of cancer at the age of 79. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, who died Saturday at <LOCATION> Sentara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, divided his time between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, hometown of his wife, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON>. He had devoted much of his life to building a multimillion-dollar art collection that is housed at the Chrysler Museum in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>. `` The Chrysler Museum and the commonwealth have lost a great friend and patron,'' museum director <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Steadman </PERSON> said Sunday. `` Mr. <PERSON> Chrysler </PERSON> was a rare collector whose encyclopedic interests distinguished him from others.'' He purchased his first work of art, a <ORGANIZATION> Renoir </ORGANIZATION>, for $ 350 at age 14. But the painting, a landscape with an inch-high nude, drew the disapproval of a teacher at the <ORGANIZATION> Hotchkiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> was a student. `` The corridor master thought it unbecoming for young men to have such paintings,'' <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> said in a 1980 interview. `` So he busted it over his knee and threw it in the trash can.'' Later at <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> founded an arts magazine with another student, senior <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>. He went against trends, buying paintings by as-yet unrecognized artists. In the 1970s, he sold a Picasso for $ 1.6 million that he had bought 30 years earlier for $ 450. The first Chrysler Museum was in <LOCATION> Provincetown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. In 1970, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> agreed to move the collection to <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> after the city offered to rename its museum for him and add a wing, as well as naming a concert hall at Scope for him. Since then, the collection has grown in size, value and reputation. It was called one of the top 20 in the country by the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> and has an 8,000-piece glass collection, one of the finest in the world. In addition to his art collecting, in 1934 Chrysler founded the Air-Temp division of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, which developed the first air conditioning system on wheels. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is survived by several nieces and nephews. A memorial service will be held Tuesday at the Church of the Good Shepherd in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>. Burial will be Wednesday in the family plot in <LOCATION> Tarrytown </LOCATION>, N.Y.

 A crack-addicted, paroled killer has been charged with slaying a 24-year-old art student because she refused to give him her pocketbook, police said. The robbery netted $ 27. <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Wrappe </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, and a first-year graduate student at <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, had been in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> just a week when she was shot to death early Wednesday, police said. Saturday night, police arrested <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> DeChirico </PERSON>, 37, of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, and charged him with <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Wrappe </PERSON>'s murder, said Deputy Inspector <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Prestia </PERSON>. Detectives from the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> homicide squad and investigators from the state parole office were able to identify DeChirico from information obtained from witnesses and street sources, he said. DeChirico, arrested nine times since 1966 on charges including robbery, drug possession, grand larceny and burglary, had been out on parole since December 1986 after serving 13 -LCB- years for manslaughter charge in a 1973 killing, police said. `` He is a local crack addict who spends a lot of time on the street,'' <PERSON> Prestia </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` We believe the robbery was for the purpose of getting money for drugs.'' `` We were looking for him, spotted him and he was taken into custody without incident,'' the police official said. <PERSON> DeChirico </PERSON> was charged with second-degree murder, robbery, criminal possession of a dangerous weapon and criminal possession of stolen property. <PERSON> Prestia </PERSON> said <PERSON> DeChirico </PERSON> was charged with the weapons count even though the gun used in the killing has not been found. The deputy inspector said DeChirico stole $ 27. Miss Wrappe's purse contained $ 1 and other personal effects when found by police the day after the killing Miss <PERSON> Wrappe </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Wrape </PERSON>, said her daughter, a 1987 graduate of Notre Dame, had moved to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` to pursue her dream'' of becoming a successful artist. She was confronted by a robber as she was returning to her <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> dormitory from her waitress job about 1 a.m. Wednesday. When she resisted, she was killed by a single bullet to the chest. `` It makes me feel better that he's off the street,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Wrape </PERSON>, whose family spells the surname the traditional way, said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>. `` I'm sure the police and the judicial system will take care of it from here, and we can count on justice being done.'' <PERSON> Prestia </PERSON> said <PERSON> DeChirico </PERSON> made no statements after his arrest. A disheveled DeChirico, who was unable or unwilling to stand on his own as he was taken from the precinct house by police, simply said `` no'' when reporters asked him if he were guilty. His arrest came hours after hundreds mourned Miss Wrappe at a requiem Mass in her hometown, and <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> remembered her as a gifted artist who `` marched to a different drummer'' and `` was not afraid to be different.'' She is survived by her parents, four brothers and a sister.

 Police swarmed through gang territories and arrested more than 870 people to curb continuing violence that left one dead and at least four wounded during the weekend, authorities said Sunday. About 380 officers from 10 police divisions arrested more than 360 people Saturday night and early Sunday after bringing in more than 510 people Friday night, police said. More than half of those arrested were suspected gang members, police said. The arrests ranged from felony drug crimes to misdemeanors. Police also wrote hundreds of traffic citations and confiscated 66 cars, eight guns, cocaine, marijuana, and $ 1,400 in cash, said Sgt. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazur </PERSON>. Gang violence continued despite police efforts. One young man was killed and another man was wounded Sunday morning in a drive-by shooting in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> community of <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, police said. A single shotgun blast from a passing car killed the man and wounded his companion, said Officer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>. Their names were withheld pending notification of relatives. A motive for the attack was not known, but police called it gang-related. At about the same time, two gang members and one innocent bystander were hit by shots fired from a passing car several blocks away from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Memorial Coliseum. Hospital officials refused to release their conditions. Two reputed gang members were booked for investigation of attempted murder in suburban <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION> on Friday night after opening fire on a crowd at a hamburger stand, said Sgt. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON>. Officers who were watching the stand because of two other drive-by shootings in the area in the past two weeks saw several people limp away after the attack, but nobody reported an injury to authorities, <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> said.

<TEXT>
 A tape recording of a preliminary strategy session for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1984 re-election campaign indicates his advisers found that his administration lacked a platform to run on, according to a new book. Reporters <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> of the Wall Street Journal and <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> <PERSON> McManus </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times describe the session in `` Landslide,'' a book about <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s second term, published by <ORGANIZATION> Houghton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mifflin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The authors do not say how they gained access to the tape recording that they say was made of the four-hour confidential meeting held in late June 1984 in a conference room at campaign headquarters of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. They quote <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, the campaign's chief strategist, as saying on the tapes, `` The problem is we've been talking to everybody at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> over the past few days _ and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration fired all its bullets very early and very successfully in the first two years. All their plans, all their priorities, all their programs. They've run out of ammunition.'' `` The most striking thing I discovered is that they do n't have a goddamn thing in the pipeline,'' <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> is quoted as saying. `` They've run out of ammunition.'' <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, a longtime <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> associate, is now an adviser to <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Pollster <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON>, according to the book, agreed with <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, saying, `` Days digging around, and we found nothing. This is a national election. We've got to find something to say.'' At one point in the discussion, <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> laughed and said `` If he got a bullet in the toe, it would help the election, would n't it.'' He clearly was nervous about his suggestion, however, and quickly added, `` Turn that tape off. I get that cartridge when you're through. Mention of <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>'s suggestion was in the book, but the authors elaborated on it in an article about the tapes in Sunday editions of The Washington Post. As the group searched for a theme, the book says, the issue of Social Security was quickly ruled out, with speechwriter <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Khachigian </PERSON> saying, `` We should have the next person who even mentions the word fired.'' The authors say that <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> suggested <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> might talk about `` acid rain and all that stuff,'' but <PERSON> Khachigian </PERSON> warned, `` We're better off without it If you get the old man going on it, he does ` killer trees'.'' The `` killer trees'' phrase originated after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> expressed the view, in his 1980 campaign, that trees cause pollution.

 About 500 people chanted a memorial prayer for the dead Sunday as six Holocaust survivors lit candles during dedication ceremonies for a monument called the `` Tower of Remembrance.'' The 80-foot granite tower _ topped by a 10-foot-high `` Eternal Flame'' covered with gold leaf _ was erected at <LOCATION> Sholom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in this <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb to honor the 6 million Jews killed in World War II. `` It means a great deal for me because I went through the Holocaust myself,'' said survivor <PERSON> Pola </PERSON> <PERSON> Mishell </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Skokie </LOCATION>, who lit her candle in memory of the Jews from her native <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> who died in the war. Mrs. <PERSON> Mishell </PERSON>, a Hebrew teacher now in her early 60s, said she has been active in recording and speaking about her recollections as a teen-ager during the Holocaust. After the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> emptied the Jewish ghetto in her small Lithuanian town, she spent 1944-45 in the <LOCATION> Stutthof </LOCATION> concentration camp near the present-day Polish city of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. `` I feel this monument is very important because after we are all gone something will remain to remind people that such horrible things all happened,'' she said. The dedication ceremony took place during the Jewish High Holy Days _ on the Sunday between <LOCATION> Rosh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hashanah </LOCATION>, the Jewish New Year, and Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement _ when the cemetery holds its annual Kever Avot, or Resting Place of our Fathers, memorial service at which families remember loved ones buried there, said <PERSON> Jules </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellow </PERSON>, a spokesman for the cemetery.

 The Pump Room, which has served meals to celebrities from <LOCATION> Bogart </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bacall </PERSON> to <PERSON> Belushi </PERSON>, and banned rocker <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> for inappropriate dress, is turning 50 and the owner says he wants the tradition to continue. `` I want the stories of today to be as legendary as the ones of 40 years ago,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Melman </PERSON>, who bought the historic restaurant in the <LOCATION> Omni </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ambassador </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION> a dozen years ago. The famous eatery, where <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacall </PERSON> celebrated their wedding, will officially mark its 50th anniversary Oct. 1. The restaurant made its name as a place for show business and high society people to see and be seen, but it also is a place where many go to celebrate anniversaries or graduations. `` To this day, many people come here for special occasions _ they get very emotional about it,'' <PERSON> Melman </PERSON> said. `` So do I. I do n't feel like the owner as much as the curator of part of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s history The Pump Room was founded by <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Byfield </PERSON> in 1938 and soon became known as the place where stars had to go when they stopped in the Windy City on their train trips to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>.

A historical booklet put out as part of the anniversary celebration lists almost 1,000 celebrities who have visited the Pump Room. Customers wearing sneakers and men without jackets are politely turned away from the restaurant _ sometimes. The rule apparently depends on how famous people are. One of the most prominently displayed photographs in the restaurant shows actor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Belushi </PERSON>, clad in a T-shirt, having dinner with film critic <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ebert </PERSON>. But rock star <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> was turned away because of inappropriate dress by a maitre d' who did not recognize him, and that led to the title of the singer's hit album, `` No Jacket Required.''

 A couple who returned from a hurricane-marred vacation Sunday said hundreds of frantic tourists were still stranded on the battered resort isle of <LOCATION> Cozumel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, when they left. `` The airport was a madhouse,'' said <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> <PERSON> Walls </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Johnson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION> `` I'm very concerned about the conditions on <LOCATION> Cozumel </LOCATION> and about the people down there.'' He said the island's drinking water was exhausted and food and medical supplies were running low. `` <LOCATION> Cozumel </LOCATION> is in bad shape,'' he said. `` There is no electricity on the island and no communications with the mainland. We felt cut off from the rest of the world after Wednesday, the day the storm hit the island.'' Walls said he and his wife, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON>, were lucky to have been able to get aboard an unscheduled charter flight that left <LOCATION> Cozumel </LOCATION> late Saturday night. They arrived in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> a few hours later, after a refueling stop at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` As of Saturday, only <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> was flying into <LOCATION> Cozumel </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` There were fistfights at the airport the day before. The people there are scared. They need help.'' He said the eye of Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> passed just six miles north of <LOCATION> Cozumel </LOCATION>, a small island located 11 miles off of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> coast, 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION> `` People were evacuated from <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>, but I do n't know of anyone who was able to get off of <LOCATION> Cozumel </LOCATION> before the storm hit,'' he said. `` There was n't any way to leave the island once the wind picked up and the seas got rough.'' Authorities on <LOCATION> Cozumel </LOCATION> did n't seemed overly worried about the storm until Tuesday, <PERSON> Walls </PERSON> said. `` Everyone seemed to think it would turn northward and miss us,'' he said. `` But the hotel management called a meeting Tuesday night and told the guests that <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> had hit <PERSON> Jamiaca </PERSON> and apparently would reach <LOCATION> Cozumel </LOCATION> the next day, unless it changed course. By then, the wind had already started to pick up. `` We were given some emergency supplies _ candles, drinking water and food _ and were told to lock ourselves in the bathroom and prop our mattress up against the bathroom door, if the storm came our way.'' He said he and his wife had a second-floor room and were able to ride out the storm in that fashion. `` The air pressure got intense, but the sound of the wind was the worst part,'' Walls said. `` The noise was terrific. A gust of wind blew out our big picture window shortly after the hurricane hit. Later, the skylight popped out and a light fixture came loose and began banging and clanging; it sounded like the roof was coming off. `` The storm hit us Wednesday morning about 6:30 a.m. and lasted until 2 p.m. It was interesting but I would n't want to do it again. We were told some of those wind gusts exceeded 200 miles per hour.''

 Orthodox Jews on Sunday mourned the loss of six sacred scrolls that police said were set afire in a synagogue by two neighborhood boys. About 5,000 people, including Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, turned out for the service near Congregation Sharai Torah in the heavily Jewish Flatbush section of the borough of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. Two boys, ages 12 and 15, were arrested and accused of setting fire to the torah scrolls and spray-painting 15 swastikas on the walls of the synagogue. The fire damaged the interior of the building and its contents. The incident occurred early Saturday, the Sabbath between <LOCATION> Rosh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hashana </LOCATION> and Yom Kippur, the two holiest days on the Jewish calender. `` You could n't do a worse crime to the Jewish people,'' said City Councilman <PERSON> Noach </PERSON> <PERSON> Dear </PERSON>, who described the mood of the community as one of anger, hurt and puzzlement. The two boys were charged Sunday as juvenile delinquents with arson, burglary and criminal mischief, said Sgt. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>, a police spokesman. They were released to the custody of their parents. Neither boy is Jewish, according to another police spokesman, Officer <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said both youths lived near the synagogue. Dear said the replacement cost of the scrolls could be as high as $ 50,000 each. Torahs, containing the first five books of the Old Testament, are considered the holiest objects in Judaism. It takes one person about one year to produce one, inscribing it by hand under exacting religious guidelines. Rabbi <PERSON> Hillel </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> held a funeral service Sunday for the torahs in accordance with Jewish law, with burial in a cemetery. `` He's in mourning,'' Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said of <PERSON> David </PERSON>, who founded the congregation in 1965. `` It's as if he lost a child.'' The congregation is temporarily using a Jewish high school for prayer. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said Sunday he was relieved that the suspects were juveniles and `` not members of some organized adult organization.'' `` The fact that they're juveniles puts a somewhat different cast on the vicious action of arson and bias that took place,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said. `` They have to be punished. They -LRB- also -RRB- have to be carefully taught to respect and tolerate and even to love.'' Others, however, found it chilling that the suspects were so young. `` This scares everybody,'' <PERSON> Dear </PERSON> said. The incident came against a backdrop of a rising number of anti-Semitic incidents nationwide, according to the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. `` I have never heard of any desecration in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in recent years where that number of torahs was destroyed,'' said <PERSON> Justin </PERSON> <PERSON> Finger </PERSON>, the league's associate national director.

 `` Rasputin,'' which premiered over the weekend at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION>, is a serious and sometimes shockingly sensual production with a strong sense of unity and easily grasped plot and music. The production, about the power-worshiping `` Mad Monk'' who advised the family of <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>'s last czar, is <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Reise </PERSON>'s first opera. The 38-year-old Reise, who teaches music at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>, also wrote the libretto. Although `` Rasputin'' was sung in English, the libretto was shown on a screen above the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> State Theater stage so the audience Saturday night would n't have to strain to understand an unfamiliar opera. Some of the music is tonal, some atonal. The opera begins with <PERSON> Rasputin </PERSON> preaching carnal sin as a path to salvation while a woman in a body stocking writhes on the floor in front of him. This is more effective than the usual operatic orgy, in which people wave their arms around sexlessly like undersea plants moved by waves. Bass-baritone <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheek </PERSON>, who sings with this company and with the Metropolitan Opera, sang <PERSON> Rasputin </PERSON>. He is tall, young and well-built for the bare-chested scenes but was n't quite forceful enough in his singing or acting. <PERSON> Rasputin </PERSON> is such an outrageous character that Cheek could project still more fire. But he is definitely on the right track. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Cusack </PERSON> was <PERSON> Czarina </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON>, who takes <PERSON> Rasputin </PERSON>'s advice in matters of state because he once stopped her hemophiliac son's bleeding Ms. <PERSON> Cusack </PERSON> sung high notes that would cause some sopranos to screech. Price was splendid in the third principal role, Prince <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> acted and sang with conviction as a terrified Czar <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> relying on a strong wife. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lankston </PERSON> also was splendid as a doctor helpless before hemophilia. The staging, by <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Corsaro </PERSON>, is direct and powerful. A nightclub scene in which <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON> sings that he's `` Bebe d'Amour'' is meant to indicate a decadent society just before it falls. Price, wearing tailcoat, shorts, nylons, garter belt and high heels, looks much like <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Grey </PERSON> in `` Cabaret.'' There is wonderful use of stylized staging. <PERSON> Erick </PERSON> <PERSON> Avari </PERSON>, in a nonsinging role as <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>, gives a speech behind a brightly lighted, transparent screen. His profile and listeners facing him from across the stage are silhouetted. In another scene, couples dance in silhouette at stage rear, establishing a ballroom setting and allowing major characters uncluttered use of the stage front. This uncluttered staging looks more German expressionistic than Russian, but it suits the opera. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Keene </PERSON>, who will succeed <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Sills </PERSON> as general director of the company in March, conducted an obviously well-prepared orchestra. The two-act opera is n't unusually long but some of Act 2 might have been trimmed. Some plot points made crystal clear the first time are retold.

<TEXT>
 A small wagon train slowly moved westward Sunday along the route of the <ORGANIZATION> Cherokee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>' `` Trail of Tears,'' bolstered by the arrival of two additional wagons and a bright, blue sky. `` A lot of us have stiff muscles and are a little bit saddle sore but we'll get over that,'' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Golconda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, the coordinator of the wagon train project. The wagon train is commemorating the 150th anniversary of the forced removal of the Cherokees from their eastern homelands to <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. About 4,000 of the 13,000 Indians who made the 1,000-mile march died along the way. The six covered wagons set out Saturday from nearby <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Historical </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, the last eastern council ground of the Cherokees, bound for <LOCATION> Tahlequah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>. No Indians have joined the group, but <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said he expects several to ride along as the trip progresses Two wagons joined the train Saturday night when the group camped at a farm just west of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, 17 miles from the park. `` We'll have dozens of wagons joining us, off and on, before we reach <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> in early December,'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> predicted Sunday. He said the wagon train will average 16 miles a day as it follows the winding route that the Cherokees took in 1838, when they walked through <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. Two of the more experienced hands on the wagon train are <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> `` Muleman'' <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, and his Australian sheep dog, Clipper. `` Me and Clipper are big buddies. We've been on wagon trains before,'' said <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, a mule skinner and logger. A pair of matched mules pulled his wooden wagon, which is carrying the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> flag to <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> said he hoped to make the entire trip to <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> but might have to stop when the wagon train reaches the <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> border two weeks from now. <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> said he was expecting financial help from the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION>, but that apparently is n't going to happen <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> state coordinator for the project, said he is hoping some sponsors will come forward as the wagon train moves westward. `` This is a private, non-profit project,'' said <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, who raises and sells horses. `` Our goal is to do some consciousness-raising about the terrible thing our government did to the Cherokees. Anybody who wants to help us, or join us, as we travel along the trail is welcome to do so.''

<HEAD>Israel Reportedly Planning Spy Satellite</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was planning to launch an experimental satellite soon as part of a program to orbit a spy satellite, a newspaper reported Sunday. The daily <ORGANIZATION> Hadashot </ORGANIZATION>, quoting foreign sources, said the experimental part of the program would last two years and that the spy satellite is to be carried by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s improved Jericho-II missile. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> refused to confirm or deny the report. `` I do n't deal with subjects of this type,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said in an interview with state-run <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. `` You have to turn to the people and industries that deal with this.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> told the radio: `` I ca n't know about every subject.'' <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinreich </PERSON> and a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman declined comment. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said they had no information on the report. The newspaper did not further identify its foreign sources used as a basis for the story. Such attribution is sometimes used by Israeli newspapers to get around restrictions of the Israeli military censor. Unnamed defense experts were quoted by <PERSON> Hadashot </PERSON> as saying putting up a spy satellite could increase <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s deterrence, providing accurate and immediate information and the investment would pay for itself by reducing reconnaissance flights. The Geneva-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> reported in July that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had successfully fired its <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION> missile into the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> sea </LOCATION>. Its maximum range was to reach 920 miles, the magazine wrote. Two major dailies, <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Maariv </ORGANIZATION>, devoted front-page articles Sunday to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s reported plan to launch a spy satellite. A decision by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 25-member <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, which holds its regular meetings Sunday, was due on the launching date, <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> quoted the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> as saying. <PERSON> Yuval </PERSON> <PERSON> Neeman </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was in the final stages of developing satellites for use in communications and science. He said the first Israeli satellite would probably be launched in 1992 by the European space consortium Ariane. Asked to comment on the reports about a reconnaissance satellite, <PERSON> Neeman </PERSON> said: `` Our present work is related to scientific experiments and communications. It does n't mean that sometime in the future <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> wo n't move in such direction -LRB- reconnaissance -RRB-.'' Last month, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> announced plans to launch two communication satellites, Amos-1 and Amos-2, in early 1990s. The satellites are to be launched by the French Ariane rocket. The satellite was the lead item on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio throughout the day.

<HEAD>Irish-American Official Calls for `Boycott' of Mayor Koch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PLAINVIEW, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A refusal by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> to meet with Irish-American leaders led a suburban official to call Sunday for a sort of boycott of the outspoken mayor. <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Comptroller <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> said at a festival that <LOCATION> Irish-American </LOCATION> groups should keep <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, who is expected to seek re-election next year, out of their organizations and activities and resulting photographs. King was angered by <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s refusal Friday to meet with Irish-American leaders because a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, was in the group. The committee supports the attempt to drive <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> troops out of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, and unite the Protestant-dominated province with the mostly Catholic southern Republic. Also in the group Friday was the national president of the Ancient Order of Hibernians and others who had traveled to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> from five states for the scheduled meeting. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cummings </PERSON>, spokesman for the national office of the Ancient Order, disagreed with <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s boycott proposal, saying Irish-Americans should take advantage of contact with <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> to educate him about the Irish conflict. But, he added, `` If I were Mr. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, I do n't think I would be attending too many Irish-American functions.'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> has offended people on more than one side of the Irish conflict, which has resulted in more than 2,000 deaths the past two decades. When he returned from a trip to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> in July, he suggested the British were a peacekeeping force rather than an occupying army in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, then backed off and apologized, angering those who liked his first statement. `` It is time to ban him completely from every Irish-American activity, including the St. Patrick's Day Parade,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, who wears a sweater he bought in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> during the parade and calls himself <PERSON> O'Koch </PERSON>, welcomed the action. `` I am happy to be boycotted by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, Mr. <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> and other supporters of terrorism,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said. `` So what, I do n't care. I consider it a compliment.'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said that the group had not given him a guest list until Thursday and when he discovered that <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> was on it, the mayor told them he would `` meet with anyone except the representatives of terrorism.'' The group, he said, declined to reschedule the meeting without <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for King, said that <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON>, state president of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, supported King's call for a boycott.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, a former military adviser for the <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> dictatorship, declared himself president on Sunday after ousting Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, adjutant general of the army, said in an early morning address on national television that the Presidential Guard toppled <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> on Saturday because it was `` sickened'' by the way <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> governed. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> was sent to the neighboring <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. Residents reported hearing heavy gunfire Saturday night near the presidential palace in what appeared to be fighting between military factions. <PERSON> Frantz </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s director of information, said soldiers were killed, but <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> mentioned no casualties. <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> radio stations reported that at least six people were killed in the capital in coup-related clashes, and that mobs pillaged two homes owned by <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> and the home of <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Franck </PERSON> <PERSON> Romain </PERSON>. The military government appealed in a national television broadcast `` for calm, discipline and order in respect of individual rights and liberties.'' A witness told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> she saw two bodies in the courtyard of <PERSON> Romain </PERSON>'s luxurious house in the suburb of <LOCATION> Delmas </LOCATION> and the property was occupied by soldiers. `` The house was stripped, doors were torn off the hinges. It was a shell,'' the witness said. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> took over a week after about 20 men armed with machetes, handguns and steel pikes attacked the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> during a Mass being said by the Rev. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>, a vocal critic of the military government. Thirteen people were killed and 77 wounded. Opposition leaders blamed <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s government for the attack and another church burning two days later. On Sunday morning, slum dwellers killed and burned the body of one man and cheered when a soldier shot and killed another man suspected of participating in the massacre. By midday, the city was quiet, but the airport was closed. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, who was adviser to ousted President <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> will respect all international treaties, liberties and human rights and said that `` dialogue will be honored for the sake of national reconciliation.'' <PERSON> Lubin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, commander of the 700-man <ORGANIZATION> Dessalines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barracks </ORGANIZATION>, was named commander-in-chief of the army, but <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> did not mention <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dessalines </PERSON> is the most feared unit in the 7,000-man army. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, who has been indicted on federal drug trafficking charges in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, had been considered the most powerful figure in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>. It was not known if <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> played a role in the coup, but sources said <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> were at odds. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> said noncommissioned officers of the Presidential Guard captured <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> in an apparently bloodless coup and persuaded <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> to take over. She said they were believed to be `` dissatisfied with recent human rights violations and the general deterioration in the security situation punctuated by attacks against the churches over the past two weeks.'' Ms. <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> phoned the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador and said he was assuming the presidency. She said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government still wants <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> to answer the drug trafficking charges in court. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> arrived in a private plane at a private airport in <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Domingo </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> capital, early Sunday morning, said <PERSON> Fabio </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabral </PERSON>, deputy foreign minister of the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, which shares the island of Hispaniola with <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>, in a military uniform, was accompanied by his wife and daughter, <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabral </PERSON> said. They arrived with no luggage and climbed into a waiting limousine, an airport employee said. They were taken to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Concorde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION>, where former President <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> stayed after <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> toppled him in a June 17 coup, <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabral </PERSON> said. It was not known if <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> would remain in the Dominican capital. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> reported <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s ouster at about 2:30 a.m., several hours after shooting broke out at the main plaza in front of the presidential palace. The gunshots sent dozens of people fleeing for cover. Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the fighting involved army factions and members of the <ORGANIZATION> Tonton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macoutes </ORGANIZATION>, the dreaded agents that terrorized Haitians during the 29-year dictatorships of the <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> family. Details were not known. In his speech to members of the Presidential Guard at the palace, <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> declared himself president and promoted himself to lieutenant general. `` The Presidential Guard, sickened by the way the country has been governed since the seventh of February, 1988 ... has been forced to act again,'' he said. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, a bespectacled, slim man of medium height, was dressed in a military uniform. He was introduced as `` the most honest officer in the armed forces'' by a sergeant who wore full battle gear. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> has been a key behind-the-scenes figure in a succession of governments since nationwide riots forced <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> to flee to exile in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> on Feb. 7, 1986. <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> had been president since the 1971 death of his father, <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>, who ruled since 1957. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> led a military junta after <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> fled. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> served as an adviser to the junta, but resigned in early 1986 after anti-government demonstrations demanded that he and other close <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> associates resign. In March 1987, voters overwhelmingly approved a new constitution calling for elections under civilian control. Gunmen killed at least 34 voters on Election Day Nov. 29, and the election was canceled. Soldiers from <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s Dessalines Barracks were blamed. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> scheduled new elections, but few people voted and <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> was elected on Jan. 17. <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> became involved in a dispute with the military over the transfers of <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> and other military leaders. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> played a key role in <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s June 17 overthrow of <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>.

 An Egyptian helicopter opened fire on three fishing boats that strayed into Egyptian waters Sunday, wounding two Palestinians from the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and sinking one of the boats, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said. Also Sunday, 15 Palestinians were wounded in clashes with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports. The army said a reserve soldier was jailed for meeting with Palestinians and promising that his unit would not use force if Arabs demonstrated peacefully. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the three fishing boats were intercepted by the helicopter about 12 miles west of the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. One of the boats was set ablaze in the firing and sank, the radio said. The whereabouts of the crew was not known, it said. Two wounded fishermen, brothers <PERSON> Azzam </PERSON> and <PERSON> Husam </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakr </PERSON>, were pulled from the water by crewmen in another boat and taken to <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Azzam </PERSON>, 25, suffered bullet wounds in the left arm and left leg, and 18-year-old <PERSON> Husam </PERSON> was shot in the right foot, according to a third brother, <PERSON> Azmi </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakr </PERSON> who spoke to reporters at the hospital. One fisherman, whose name was not given, was arrested on charges of leaving <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> illegally and entering another country, the radio said. A Foreign Ministry official declined comment. On Sept. 9, the <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> navy seized an Israeli fishing boat and a tour boat in the Red Sea for straying into Egyptian waters. The tour boat was released after about five hours, but the fishing boat and its crew remain in detention. Violent clashes erupted in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> on Sunday, a day earmarked by pro-PLO uprising leaders for `` confronting the occupation with force to protest the massacres being committed against our people.'' At least 268 Palestinians have been killed and thousands injured since the Dec. 8 start of the uprising. Six Israelis have also died. Arab reporters and hospital officials said 15 Palestinians were wounded. An army official said he had reports of seven Palestinian casualties but that the army was still investigating how the seven were hurt. The worst violence occurred in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> where several hundred Palestinians set up barricades with rocks and barrels to block traffic. When Israeli troops arrived in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>' central market to clear the narrow alleys, they were pelted with stones and empty bottles, witnesses said. Troops fired tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition to break up the crowd, said the witnesses. Two Palestinians were wounded in the clash, hospital officials said. In a separate incident, a 12-year-old Nablus youth, <PERSON> Majed </PERSON> <PERSON> Akef </PERSON>, was shot in his left leg. <PERSON> Akef </PERSON> told reporters at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> he was shot while playing soccer in front of his house He said a military jeep had been stoned nearby but that he was not involved. During army sweeps in the northern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION>, a Palestinian youth attacked an army officer with an ax. The officer opened fire, wounding the youth, the army said. Eleven other Palestinians were wounded in clashes in the occupied lands, including a 13-year-old shot in the right arm in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION>, hospital officials said. Most shops and offices in <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION> were closed to protest the shooting death of a <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION> teen-ager on Saturday. The army clamped curfews on seven <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> towns and refugee camps, confining 65,000 Palestinians to their homes. Also Sunday, the army said a military court sentenced a reserve soldier to two weeks in jail for meeting with <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leaders in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>. An army official said the soldier, <PERSON> Hillel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bardin </PERSON>, acted without authorization. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said <PERSON> Bardin </PERSON> promised the leaders his unit would not use force if Palestinians demonstrated peacefully. <PERSON> Bardin </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Anita </PERSON>, said in an interview with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio her husband was only `` trying to improve relations between Jews and Arabs.''

He achieved that goal, and 42 years later he ended up being the fire boss who protected the historic Old Faithful Lodge from the firestorm that has engulfed <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, the country's oldest national park. `` Letting that burn would have been an end to everybody's career, starting with mine,'' said <PERSON> Bungarz </PERSON>, who works in the <ORGANIZATION> Mendocino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> `` <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> would n't have been far enough away for us.'' <PERSON> Bungarz </PERSON>, 53, became a local celebrity as he appeared regularly on national news broadcasts during the wild days of early September, when the North Fork fire attacked the Old Faithful area with 400-foot flames. That came only several days after the fire roared toward the <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> community of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> on the outskirts of the park. Protecting those areas, with the loss of some cabins at Old Faithful, was one of the few successes of firefighters battling the 335,500-acre blaze. <PERSON> Bungarz </PERSON> was the incident commander on the North Fork fire during those hectic days, but he does n't consider himself the hero many people think he is. `` We threw everything at that fire from day one. We tried everything we knew of or could think of,'' he said. But he readily conceded that in many ways the fire prevailed. `` It seemed everything we did did n't work,'' <PERSON> Bungarz </PERSON> said. `` Like one line in camp went, ` What does the North Fork fire do when the wind comes up? Whatever it wants to.''' <PERSON> Bungarz </PERSON> said he thinks humor is essential in the tense and often scary business of fighting fires. `` It helps smooth things out when you start to have fun with each other,'' he said. <PERSON> Bungarz </PERSON> directed firefighters on the North Fork fire from a camp at <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Junction </LOCATION>, 14 miles east of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>. He left over the weekend when his team was relieved. Bungarz, like other firefighting officials, knows the political firestorm over handling of the fires is just beginning. He would n't be surprised to be called to testify before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which plans hearings on the fires that have affected 1.2 million acres of the park's 2.2 million acres `` We'll just tell them what happened and what we did,'' <PERSON> Bungarz </PERSON> said. `` Our work and our meetings have been open -LRB- to the public -RRB- all the way and they'll stay that way. If we made mistakes, we'll take our lumps.

 The Social Democrats kept control of parliament and the upstart <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> won seats for the first time, nationwide election returns showed Sunday. The governing party, architects of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s welfare state, faced one of its most serious election challenges in 50 years in the first national vote since its leader, <PERSON> Olaf </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>, was assassinated on Feb. 28, 1986. The big losers appeared to be the three non-socialist parties. A computer projection carried by <ORGANIZATION> Swedish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, based on returns from 340 of 360 population centers, indicated that the Moderates, <ORGANIZATION> Liberals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would lose 21 of their 171 seats in the 349-seat Riksdag, or parliament. The Social Democrats lost only one of their 159 seats and the <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> picked up 20 seats, the television projections showed. The computer projection indicated the Communists, which had 19 seats, picked up two additional seats. Overall, the Social Democrats were projected to win 43.9 percent of the total, or 158 seats; the Moderates, 17.9 percent, 64 seats; the Liberals, 12 percent, or 43 seats; the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, 11.9 percent, or 43 seats; the Communists, 5.7 percent, or 21 seats; the <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION>, 5.5 percent, 20 seats; and the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, 3.1 percent, no seats. Prime Minister <PERSON> Ingvar </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON>, leader of the Social Democrats, said the government will hold the same course and offered a critique of the Greens. `` We will stick to the same policy as before,'' he said in a television interview. `` The interesting thing is that the environment party entered -LRB- parliament -RRB- but are not power brokers.... That is good, maybe even for them `` The problem is that we do n't know where they stand,'' <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> said of the Greens. `` We will be able to judge them by their deeds in the Riksdag.'' Greens spokeswoman <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Goes </PERSON> declined to say whether her party will lean to the left or right. `` We'll be dynamic when it comes to ecology. That's what this election is about, the issues of the future, the 1990s ... and you can ask yourself whether that is left or right,'' she said in a television interview. Greens members were jubilant over their victory. `` Great fun,'' said party spokesman <PERSON> Birger </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlaug </PERSON>. `` This was an impossible project, to get a new party into <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s Riksdag.. Our existence means parliament will be greener, and that's what's needed. Political analyst <PERSON> Soren </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmberg </PERSON> called the showing by the three non-socialists a `` disaster'' and `` their worst result in Swedish history.'' The voter turnout was an unusually low 85.8 percent of those eligible, television reported. Also competing for the attention of 6.3 million registered voters were about 100 minor parties. They ranged from the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which opposes foreign immigration to <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, to the <ORGANIZATION> Donald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Duck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, a joke party with no platform for voters who might otherwise turn in blank ballots. Swedes also choose 284 municipal and 24 county councils and vote on local issues. A series of scandals have eroded support for the Social Democrats in the past two years. Among them was failure of police to find <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>'s killer and reports of official bungling in the investigation. At the same time, opposition to nuclear power and growing environmental concerns, especially among young people, drew support to the Greens and away from the established parties. Pre-election polling suggested the Communists were in danger of being shut out for the first time since their founding in 1917. On the eve of the election, <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON>, got mediocre reviews on his performance in a televised debate Friday night. With the exception of 1976-1982, when the country was governed by a center - right coalition, the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> have been at the helm of the Swedish welfare state since 1932 In the election campaign, they stressed their economic successes, such as reducing unemployment from 3 percent to 1.7 percent, one of the world's lowest rates. They also stressed standardized health care, child care and universal education in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, where poverty is practically unknown. The country's taxes are, however, the highest in the world. An employee making the equivalent of $ 50,000 a year can expect to give half of it to the government, and the rate can reach up to 80 percent for higher incomes. Consumer prices are boosted by a 23.4 percent value added tax rate and inflation, about 7 percent so far this year, is roughly twice the European average. The three non-socialist parties proposed various options for tax reforms. They also urged a loosening of welfare regulations that would allow Swedes to choose private health care and schools for their children.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The motives behind Sunday's military coup in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> were obscure, but the first reaction from advocates of democratic reform was optimism `` I will support the military government if they say as soon as possible when they will call elections. We are ready to speak with any government that respects human rights,'' said <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dejoie </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, 60-year-old leader of the national <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said by telephone from <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, who seized power in a palace coup from Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>, promised in his first public statement to respect civil liberties, human rights and said `` dialogue will be honored for the sake of national reconciliation.'' The statement was considered signficant because it echoed a recent offer for dialogue from opposition leader <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Bazin </PERSON>, a conservative leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Understanding </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bazin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dejoie </PERSON> were among the four leading candidates for president in the Nov. 29 elections that were aborted by the independent Electoral Council when armed thugs supported by the army attacked voters at the polls. The council was later abolished by <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>, who held new elections Jan. 17. The leading candidates boycotted the second election, which was won by <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>, who was in office only four months when <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> ousted him in a bloodless coup. `` In the next week or so, I expect them -LRB- the military -RRB- to say when elections will be held. They must do it or they wo n't have any support,'' <PERSON> Dejoie </PERSON> said. Even <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s small <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> expressed pleasure with the turn of events. `` This ... has come at the right moment to put an end to a government which was going to lead the country to an abyss ... We greet with satisfaction the first declaration of the new president,'' said <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourjolly </PERSON>, second in command of the party. Another opposition politician, <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronceray </PERSON>, runner-up to <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> in the military-controlled elections of Jan. 17, said, `` All our difficulties come from the absence of dialogue. Dialogue is indispensable to the democratic process. <PERSON> Bazin </PERSON> has only revived the theme.'' A Western diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, predicted the new military government will maintain the old cabinet, but propose an opening to civilians with a view to elections. He also said other motives played a role in the coup. `` The coup seems to have begun, as the coup against <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> did, with the non-commissioned officers and soldiers of the 1,000-man Presidential Guard,'' he said. `` Under <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>, they felt slighted and felt their privileges threatened. Under <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>, they did not receive the material signs of recognition they expected, and on top of that, the atrocity last Sunday must have affected these men of the people ... -LRB- while -RRB- the High Command stood by.'' On Sept. 11, about 20 men armed with machetes, handguns and steel pikes attacked a church during a Mass being said by the Rev. <PERSON> Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>, a militant opponent of the military government. Thirteen people were killed and 77 wounded. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s government was blamed by opponents for the violence. The Presidential Guardsmen were the first military men to publicly condemn the government. The diplomat speculated that the fact that Col. <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> did not intervene with his 700-man <ORGANIZATION> Dessalines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battalion </ORGANIZATION> indicated he was in favor of ousting <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>. `` Avril's margin of maneuver will be limited by the NCOs, who have gotten a taste for power, having now overthrown two governments, one civilian, one military,'' he said. There was at least one opponent of <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> who was still not satisfied with developments. <PERSON> Sylvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Claude </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and one of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s most popular politicians, said in an interview on Radio Soleil Sunday, `` The coup was imminent, but the person who replaced <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> is unacceptable. He was already rejected -LRB- by the people -RRB-. He is known as a Duvalierist and all Duvalierists are criminals.''

<HEAD>Priests Asked To Support Gun Control Law In Homilies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Roman Catholic priests in the <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Archdiocese </LOCATION> were urged to support the state's handgun control law during their Sunday homilies to parishioners. The request was made by the archdiocese's <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in a strongly worded letter signed by its director, <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> A.W </PERSON>. <PERSON> Doby </PERSON>. A referendum on rescinding the law, which bans cheap, easily concealable handguns, will be on the Nov. 8 ballot. Opponents collected enough signatures to bring it before the voters. The letter, sent to the 700 priests in the archdiocese, refers to the opponents of the law as `` apostles of violence'' running `` a campaign of propaganda based on deception'' in their effort to defeat the ban. There was no immediate indication whether priests had complied with the request. The archdiocese includes all the state except southern <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suburbs and the eastern shore. The handgun control law was passed by the 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and signed by Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON>. The law establishes an appointed board to compile a roster of handguns that may be made or sold in the state after Jan. 1, 1990. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Griiser </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> the Gun Ban, criticized the commission's tactic, saying that by issuing the letter to priests, the church was `` putting words in the priests' mouths. `` Does this now mean all Catholics are against us?'' <PERSON> Griiser </PERSON> asked. `` I do n't think what the church is for, is to take a stand on government issues. I'm sorry to see they're getting involved in it. If the church's job is spiritual guidance, that's what they should stick to.'' Ms. <PERSON> Doby </PERSON> said urging priests to speak on a local public issue was `` very unusual.'' She said the mailing was `` not the Archdiocese of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> telling priests: ` This is what you're supposed to say. These are not marching orders. This is not a script.'' The bishops of the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> are already on record as supporting the law. Supporters contend the law will curb the proliferation of cheap handguns called Saturday Night Specials, while opponents say they fear it could eventually prohibit the sale of all new handguns.

 The Christian-led army said Sunday it rejected what it called an attempt by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to name a new Lebanese president. Christians and Moslems in the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, which is empowered to name a successor to President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> before his term ends Friday, have been deadlocked for five weeks over who will be the new head of state. The military command said in a statement that army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> was informed by an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> official that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> leaders agreed `` to name the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> president.'' The statement thanked them for their efforts to find ways of ending the stalemate that threatens to reignite <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 13-year-old civil war between Moslems and Christians But it indirectly accused the Americans and Syrians of meddling in <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> affairs. `` The army can not accept the principle of appointing a <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> president because the choice of the president should be made exclusively by the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>,'' the statement said. Constitutionally, <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> can not run for a second consecutive six-year term. The army issued the statement soon after <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> Near </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> affairs, said he was confident <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> will resolve its deadlock. `` I certainly hope so because I think that the choice of no election ... would be a very unfortunate choice indeed,'' he told reporters after meeting with <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> and other leaders. He flew from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, in a Lebanese military helicopter after the talks. Airport sources in <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> said he caught a scheduled flight to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> en route to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. A Lebanese army source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said one of <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s aides, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, met <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> at his residence in <LOCATION> Nakkash </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, and told him of the alleged deal worked out by <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> during the last five days. Christian sources, also speaking anonymously, said <PERSON> Auon </PERSON> was told the Americans and Syrians agreed to support the election of <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Daher </PERSON> as president. <PERSON> Daher </PERSON>, 58, represents <LOCATION> Akkar </LOCATION> province in <LOCATION> north </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, an area controlled by the <ORGANIZATION> Syrian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which has some 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> television station run by the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, the Christians' main militia, said <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> and the Maronite patriarch, <PERSON> Mar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Butros </PERSON>, told <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> they opposed <PERSON> Daher </PERSON>'s selection. It said the militia, sympathetic to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and bitterly opposed to <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> intervention, also rejected `` <PERSON> Daher </PERSON>'s appointment'' as president. The army statement did not explicitly say it would take military action to prevent the appointment of any president not elected by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. An attempt to hold parliamentary voting to choose a new president collapsed Aug. 18 after pro-Israeli Christians opposed the candidacy of Syrian-backed former president <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON> and boycotted the session. A 51-member quorum is required to elect a president. Sources close to Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, a Shiite Moslem, said he will advance the date set for a parliamentary session to elect a new president from Thursday to Tuesday. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> earlier Sunday after four days of intensive talks with Syrian leaders on how to break the electoral deadlock in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Asked whether agreement has been reached on a consensus candidate, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said: `` I do n't want to go into details ... The current situation is very sensitive and delicate.''

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, his shoulders draped with a leopard skin, on Sunday urged the Marxist government and rebels to end their 12-year civil war and called for international aid to rebuild the country. `` I felt the heart of the people bleed,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops, criticized by the government for advocating negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> Mozambique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> rebels. During the last full day of a 10-day trip through southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the pope comforted victims whose limbs were blown off by land mines, celebrated Mass at a soccer stadium decked with political banners and was greeted by a boisterous crowd of 5,000 when he blessed an orphanage in a slum of reed huts. He met with anti-apartheid clergy leaders from neighboring <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s government has accused of aiding the guerrilla insurgency. The civil war began shortly after <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> gained independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1975. `` With violence, nothing can be built and much is lost,'' he said, urging citizens of this nation on the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> coast of southeastern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to follow `` the path of dialogue and reconciliation which will stop the spilling of blood among brothers.'' Addressing himself to the rebels, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said: `` Abandon the paths of violence and vengeance. Put aside destructive action and try to save what's left.'' The government, he said, `` should make efforts in the sense of building.'' `` This nation needs assistance from other peoples and from the international community,'' he said. `` Let me stress the urgency of this solidarity, aimed at a quick, total pacification and immediate aid grants to save a large amount of human lives.'' The government accuses the guerrillas of massacres and destruction of crops. The rebels deny such charges. Among the crowd of about 50,000 were the anti-apartheid church leaders from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, including the Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, and the Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Council of Churches. They are leaders of a civil disobedience campaign challenging emergency regulations and apartheid, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s system of racial segregation <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, at a news conference following the meeting with the pope, criticized <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> for meeting with South African authorities. <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON> suggested that the pope should have made more explicit criticisms of apartheid during his 10-day tour of southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which included an unscheduled stop in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> because of bad weather in <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON> said the three-hour papal stop in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> was a propaganda coup for South African authorities, who had complained previously about the omission of their country from the official itinerary. <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> said at the news conference that the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> had met with officials who were `` persecuting us'' and had been escorted by `` people who torture us.'' Banners at Machava Sports Stadium bore slogans such as `` Apartheid is the Nazism of our era'' and `` One does not negotiate the motherland, one defends it.'' During his homily, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> should be afforded `` peace from the outside, of an ideological, military and economic nature'' _ an apparent reference to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which has been accused of using a variety of tactics to harrass <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. The pope wore a leopard skin, a symbol of power to many Africans. Most of the crowd at the stadium joined a 300-strong choir in singing the hymn `` What a Friend We Have in <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' in the Tsonga language, to the accompaniment of drums and hand-clapping. Gifts of ivory carvings, fruit and a brass chalice were carried up a red-carpeted stairway to the altar. Children released balloons and white doves, one of which alighted briefly on the head of a white-robed priest. The pontiff, who returns to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on Monday, has visited <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> and made a brief, unscheduled stop in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> when his plane was diverted in bad weather. The war in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> has forced 2 million of the 14.5 million population to flee their homes and left millions more in need for foreign food aid. <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> has been campaigning for more international relief aid. Food and other supplies do not always reach the rural areas where they are needed because of attacks by guerrillas and transportation difficulties. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> offered $ 50,000 to patients at <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where he visited six wards before the Mass. He blessed and gave Vatican medals to amputees and other victims of guerrilla attacks, and he kissed children lying in their beds. `` I suffer because you are suffering and it is not in my power to cure you,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said. In July, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> tried to encourage peace efforts in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> by sending one of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s top aides to meet separately with <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Joaquim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> and South African President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> met the pope last May in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, but the <LOCATION> Vactican </LOCATION> appears to be holding off the establishment of diplomatic relations as an incentive to advancing the peace process. About one-eighth of <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s people are <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. The government does nothing to promote or encourage religion, but tolerates the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and other religious groups and has been working to improve strained relations. The government recently returned places of worship that it said were mistakenly confiscated during a period of nationalization following independence. But hospitals and schools formerly run by churches remain nationalized.

 Workers searched on Sunday for the bodies of up to 200 people swept away when a river poured over its banks and overturned four buses. Ninety people were confirmed dead. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> helicopter lost power and crashed during evacuation operations in <LOCATION> Sabinas </LOCATION> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Hidalgo </PERSON>, but no one was injured, officials said. The buses were caught in the path of the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Catarina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> when a flash flood spawned by Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> ripped a 40-mile-long path of destruction Saturday through northern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s most populated region It was the epilogue to a week of death and havoc caused by <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, which ravaged the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> resort areas of <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cozumel </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Isla </PERSON> <PERSON> Mujeres </PERSON> before crossing the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and hitting <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> again in the northeast near <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The storm killed at least 98 people while coursing the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, including 29 in the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> when it hit land last Wednesday with winds of up to 200 mph, 26 in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, 30 in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, five in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and eight in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. Two people were klled Saturday in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> by tornados spawned by the storm. But it was in this capital of the state of <LOCATION> Nuevo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leon </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> exacted its highest death toll after it weakened into a tropical storm late Friday. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s rains created a 10-foot-deep, 150-yard-wide torrent of muddy water by Saturday when the river roared through <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>. By Sunday, it was almost back to its normal size of 20 feet, allowing soldiers to use cranes to pull the crushed body of one intercity passenger bus from the mud. `` They hope to find bodies because they do n't know exactly how many people were in the bus or how many were able to save themselves,'' said rescue coordinator Lt. Col. <PERSON> Vicente </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamez </PERSON> of the 7th Military Zone. The first bus yanked by its chassis from a murky grave in the <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> riverbed revealed only empty seats, twisted metal and piles of shoes and clothing. Soldiers used picks to dig through the rubble of mud, stones and tree branches inside the bus's crushed remains. Another bus, also upside down and crushed, lay in the gravel on the other side of the stream. The remains of two other buses were further downstream. <PERSON> Gamez </PERSON> said only two survivors were located by Sunday. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pichardo </PERSON>, an employee of the <ORGANIZATION> Transportes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Frontera </ORGANIZATION> bus line, said he believed about 64 people were aboard the two buses from his company that were destroyed in the flood. It was not known how many other passengers were aboard the other two buses, one identified as belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> Transportes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Noreste </ORGANIZATION> line and another, possibly an urban bus. But state officials said the total aboard the four buses was about 200 and that 90 people were confirmed dead. A `` considerable number'' of people were missing, said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Natividad </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <PERSON> Baras </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Nuevo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> secretary. The storm left 30,000 people homeless and caused about $ 60 million in damages to public roads, bridges and other facilities in the metropolitan <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <PERSON> Baras </PERSON> said. President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> toured damaged areas in <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> Sunday. `` I want to extend my most sincere condolences to the families of those that lost their lives,'' he said. Four state judicial policemen and two civilian volunteers also drowned when they attempted to rescue victims, state authorities said. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> helicopter evacuating residents from the small town of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Abajo </LOCATION> to nearby <LOCATION> Sabinas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hidalgo </LOCATION> lost power about 3:45 p.m. as it took off and fell about 50 feet, brushing a house under construction, the <PERSON> Sabinas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hidalgo </PERSON> municipal police reported. Commander <PERSON> Leopoldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Villarreal </PERSON> said the three Americans and one Mexican on board were taken to the local hospital for a checkup and released. Their names were not immediately available. About 12 inches of rain fell over the 24-hour period before the flood, but the destruction was caused by runoff from the towering peaks of the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oriental </ORGANIZATION> chain that surrounds this semi-arid metropolitan area. Meanwhile, in northeastern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> aircraft from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> were picking up scores of people near <LOCATION> Vallecillo </LOCATION> that were threatened by swollen rivers as scattered rains continued in northeastern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Mexican state authorities requested the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> assistance. <PERSON> Gamez </PERSON> said other rescue crews were searching for bodies in <LOCATION> Cadereyta </LOCATION> about 20 miles downstream from <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> where the flood also wiped out homes and killed more than a dozen people. An estimated 20,000 people packed shelters throughout the area Sunday, most left homeless when the flood swept away homes built along the river's edge. The homes were evacuated hours before the destruction hit, but most of the poor residents who occupied them lost their life's possessions Many used picks or bare hands to dig through the rubble that remained where their tiny concrete and tin houses had stood. They hoped to rescue scant possessions: a tiny mud-covered television set, a twisted metal kitchen cabinet, a pair of shoes that no longer could be of any use.

<HEAD>Theaters Tighten Security After Two Shootings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two theaters bolstered security after two youths were shot and hundreds more were involved in fights during the weekend premiere of a rap music movie. The first shooting occurred after the management of a downtown theater, <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midtown </ORGANIZATION>, announced the 9:30 showing Friday night of `` Tougher Than Leather'' featuring the rap group <ORGANIZATION> Run-DMC </ORGANIZATION> was canceled and asked those with ticket stubs to line up for refunds. Fights broke out in the lobby and the auditorium of the theater, as groups of teen-agers from different neighborhoods taunted each other and hurled popcorn and soda across the seats, according to witnesses and police. Minutes later, with about 200 people still inside the darkened auditorium, shots rang out, officials said. Filmgoers rushed out of the theater. The injured youth, <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, collapsed a half-block away with a wound in his buttocks. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was released from <ORGANIZATION> Thomas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> Saturday. In the second incident, at the <ORGANIZATION> Eric </ORGANIZATION> 3 on the Campus theater, near <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>, two youths began arguing during the movie at about 10:40 p.m., according to usher <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON>. `` One guy yells, ` I got a gun.' Everybody started rushing for the doors,'' <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> said. Fights broke out, and before the melee ended, a 19-year-old man walking by the theater was shot in the hip. <PERSON> Orville </PERSON> <PERSON> Walls </PERSON> was in good condition Sunday night at the Hospital of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>. Police declined to link the shooting with the violence inside the theater. Walls said Sunday the angle of the shot indicated the gunman was on the sidewalk and not inside the theater doors. Detective <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilstein </PERSON> said no further incidents were reported Saturday or Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midtown </ORGANIZATION> canceled two Saturday matinees but reopened Saturday night with the movie playing on both screens. A half-dozen police officers stood guard. `` We do n't feel it is the movie that caused the problems,'' said Midtown general manager <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON>. `` The movie is n't that violent. We think the major problem was that we did n't have enough seats to accommodate all the potential customers.'' Police agreed. `` Now that they are showing in both theaters, they have alleviated much of the problems,'' Bilstein said. `` No one is waiting outside now.'' At the other theater, manager <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindo </PERSON> said he would use seven security guards instead of two and 10 ushers instead of six. `` I'm going to talk with our district manager and try to get this movie out of here,'' <PERSON> Lindo </PERSON> said. `` We're very upset because the theater is geared mainly toward college students.'' Concerts featuring Run-DMC in other cities in recent years have attracted youth gangs and resulted in violence and relatively large numbers of drug and theft arrests.

<HEAD>Pavarotti Sounds Golden at Recital in Met Opera</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When the Metropolitan Opera started presenting occasional Sunday recitals by some of its singers in 1978, tenor <PERSON> Luciano </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON>, already a superstar, sang the first one. On Sunday, he sang his second one, with Met artistic director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> accompanying on piano. If his voice has lost quality in the 10 years, you'd never know it from this recital. He looks physically fit, too, and has not put back all the weight he lost in last year's bout of slimming. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> complements a singer beautifully, neither keeping the piano too far in the background nor pushing too far forward. <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON> began with a love aria from <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>'s `` Cosi fan tutte'' and there was a hint of strain there, though a listener had to strain to be sure of it. From then on, all was golden. <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON> not only has a surpassingly beautiful tone but it is individual. If you turn on a radio and he's singing, you know it's <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON> On Sunday, his voice was flexible in fast passages and his tones were rounded and substantial. His voice filled out, later in his career than he expected, from its early small-scaled purity. Acting with his voice is n't <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON>'s strongest quality but he shaded into an effective pianissimo several times. It was n't ultraquiet pianissimo but it was soft enough to express the emotion called for He bit into the `` M'appari'' aria from <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Flotow </PERSON>'s opera `` Martha'' with deep familiarity and the audience responded at the end with especially lengthy applause. Another of the special winners was `` Pourquoi me reveiller'' from <PERSON> Massenet </PERSON>'s `` Werther.'' Audiences know how they'd like to hear that sung in the opera and <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON> made that idea materialize. In the darker parts of the aria, he did n't make it extremely dark, just shaded. He did n't sing only arias but included some art songs, by <PERSON> Bellini </PERSON>, <PERSON> Respighi </PERSON> and one each by <LOCATION> Mascagni </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sibella </PERSON> and <PERSON> Denza </PERSON>. Encores included an aria from `` Tosca,'' `` Marie Chiare'' by <PERSON> Tosti </PERSON> and `` Nessun dorma'' from `` Turandot,'' the melodically soaring aria which <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON> likes to make his final encore.

<HEAD>Cemetery Dedicated For Canadian Veterans Of Vietnam War</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 ST-BERNARD-DE-LACOLLE, <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Uniformed veterans marched in this town near the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> border on Sunday and dedicated a national cemetery for Canadians who fought in the Vietnam War. Organizers described the event as the official `` welcome home'' for Canadians who served in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The cemetery was named after <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Dextraze </PERSON>, one of 70 Canadians who died in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. They were remembered in two days of religious services and ceremonies in this farming community of 1,500, about 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> border. <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Dextraze </PERSON> said his family was not surprised when his younger brother, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, went south to join the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marines. But he said his father was probably the most upset when the 21-year-old died in action in 1969. `` The Canadian government -LRB- the military -RRB- was n't doing anything that excited a kid his age and with the American forces being involved in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, he went there for more action,'' said <PERSON> Dextraze </PERSON>, 45. `` It's touching that something has finaly been done for the fellows in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` It was a long time coming.'' About 20,000 Canadians served in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Currently, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government provides some medical benefits for Canadian <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> vets. <PERSON> Yvon </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON>, 44, a burly former member of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s elite <PERSON> Green </PERSON> <PERSON> Berets </PERSON>, led a platoon of about 30 Canadian <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans in the parade. The procession also included a contingent from the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legion </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> marching band from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Drum </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and color guards and a firing squad from <LOCATION> Plattsburgh </LOCATION> Air Force Base, N.Y. Many of the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> vets wore their service decorations and camouflaged jungle uniforms. About 300 townsfolk lined the half-mile route and applauded the parade when it procession arrived at the cemetery, where a miniature replica of the Vietnam War Memorial in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is to be erected Nov. 11. The Canadian Forces did not send a delegation. Gen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manson </PERSON>, chief of defense staff, told organizers in a letter last week that <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> does not recognize the voluntary participation of Canadians in foreign conflicts in which <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> does not take part. But <PERSON> Roy </PERSON>, one of the event's main organizers, said he was pleased with the dedication ceremonies, carried out under overcast skies and which included a 21-gun salute and two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> service buglers blowing taps. The only Canadian government representative at the ceremony was from the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, although Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> sent a message of goodwill, as did President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.

 The remains of Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> passed across <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sunday, swelling rivers as hundreds of people began clearing debris from homes and businesses damaged by at least 41 tornadoes spun off by the storm. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, controller at the state's <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, said Sunday night that his office was monitoring areas where flash flood and tornado watches were in effect until Sunday night, but had no reports of significant flooding. `` It's been actually pretty light tonight,'' he said. `` I think we're still lucky.'' Nearly 2 inches of rain fell Sunday at <LOCATION> Quanah </LOCATION>, northwest of <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, which had a thunderstorm and high wind Sunday night, and some roads were under water in <LOCATION> Ozona </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sunday afternoon, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. The remains of <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> were moving out of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and into <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> late Sunday night, the weather service said. Forecasters told residents of central <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and southeast <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> to watch for possible flooding early Monday. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, tornadoes touched down just to the west of <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION> Sunday at <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sweetwater </LOCATION> and at <LOCATION> Eskota </LOCATION>, but only minor damage was reported, the weather service said. A total of 41 tornadoes swept the state as the remains of <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> headed northward, officials said. Two people were reported killed, both in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> late Friday and Saturday. State officials said they did not expect to have a dollar estimate of damages throughout the state for a few days. Trees and roofs were blown away at <ORGANIZATION> Kelly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, causing $ 3 million damage. Scores of apartments were destroyed or damaged at one complex. Telephone and electric service was knocked out in areas. An air-conditioning system at a <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> was damaged, prompting Mayor <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> to declare a state of emergency so replacement parts could be flown in and the transfer of patients avoided. `` <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> was very lucky,'' <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> said. `` We could have had 15, 20, 25 or 50 people killed in this incident.'' In northeastern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> aircraft picked up people threatened by swollen rivers Sunday, but a dam thought to be in danger was re-evaluated and declared safe, said <PERSON> Laureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Chernow </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. At least 98 deaths and billions of dollars in damage were blamed on the storm in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. An additional 90 deaths were confirmed and more than 100 others were feared drowned after a rain-swollen river overturned four buses in <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Terrell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in southwest <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> rose 30 feet overnight and was up to 12 feet above flood stage Sunday evening, officials said. But high water that had forced the closing of two farm-to-market roads had subsided, said <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Holleyman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Terrell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> deputy sheriff. The roads were reopened and a rock slide that also blocked one of those roads had been cleared, he said. Authorities in the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Country </LOCATION>, a ranching and farming area, kept an eye on the flood-prone <LOCATION> Guadalupe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, but no flooding was reported. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, telephone and utility crews worked to restore service, and residents of apartments and houses hit by tornadoes began cleaning up. A twister struck a mobile home near downtown early Saturday, killing 59-year-old <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON>, who was thrown about 100 feet from her bedroom. Recently widowed, she was sharing the trailer with her son and daughter-in-law. `` We're all pretty much in a daze. We really do n't know how to react to anything right now,'' said the daughter-in-law, <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON>. `` We'll take one day at a time. We'll clean up and eventually we'll get our own house put up if we get some money to buy lumber and tin.'' On Friday, a man was killed when a tornado knocked a tree onto his house in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sulsh </PERSON>, 54, was taking a shower when the tornado struck her third-story apartment at The Lodge apartments, where at least 120 units were destroyed, 264 others damaged and some 300 tenants left homeless. `` There was all this insulation all over me in the shower. I got out of the shower and braced myself against the door and then I saw all the roof fall down in the living room,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sulsh </PERSON> said. `` I was open to the world, so I grabbed my nightgown and robe. I was more worried about getting my clothes on than being sucked out of the shower by the wind.''

 Celebrities joined with former political prisoners for a rally Sunday in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> on the eve of an <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> concert to promote human rights. Mayor <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> joined actresses <PERSON> Margot </PERSON> <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, activists and former prisoners from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in encouraging the crowd to sign a petition in support of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Declaration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>. `` We can no longer afford to remain silent,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON>. `` We must recognize that what happens to our brothers and sisters around the world affects us. We must lead our leaders. We must teach them respect for human rights. We must teach them to love.'' Monday's concert is part of a six-week worldwide concert tour by <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> to mark the 40th anniversary of the human rights declaration. Concerts are also scheduled for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, monitors human rights abuses, particularly the plight of political prisoners. The organization won the 1977 Nobel Peace Prize. `` We give concerts, we speak out, and we never, never remain silent. Make the <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Declaration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> a reality instead of the beautiful dream it is,'' Ms. <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON> said. The former `` prisoners of conscience'' who attended the rally included <PERSON> Alicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Partnoy </PERSON>, a former prisoner in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> jailed for her activities as a student. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Blumer </PERSON> said prisoners of conscience are those who have been imprisoned for their beliefs or religion and non-violent and non-criminal acts.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had already begun to fire back at <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> before former aide <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> rejoined his campaign, but <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has become even more combative since, his sharpened rhetoric bearing the stamp of the man he likens to a brother. Exiled from the campaign a year ago, after admitting his role in the videotape that helped drive Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> from the presidential race, <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> returned to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' side two weeks ago. And the friends who gathered to welcome him back erupted in approval when he made a simple declaration: `` There are contrasts and weaknesses that are issues in this campaign. I will not shy away from pointing these contrasts out.'' The return of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' longtime political alter ego came at a time when the Democratic presidential nominee had lost the momentum he gained from his party's national convention and as he was being criticized for not responding aggressively to attacks from <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his fellow Republicans.

 Remember President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s nationally televised pledge last January to veto future catchall spending bills like the $ 600 billion behemoth <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> sent him last year, and the promises by scores of lawmakers from both parties not to do it again? Guess what may be about to happen. As the Oct. 1 start of the 1989 fiscal year approaches, increasing numbers of senators and representatives, and their aides, concede that an omnibus spending bill looms as a real possibility. It would n't be as large as last year's. After all, two of the 13 individual appropriations bills that finance the government have already been signed into law, and four others have been sent to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for his signature. But with the presidential campaign influencing much of what happens in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> these days, and with the hopper stuffed with legislation <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wants to pass before leaving town next month, a catchall spending bill may well be the result.

<HEAD>Analysts: Hot-Selling Ford Probe May Be Creating Own Market Niche</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With little advertising and less fanfare, the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> Probe is speeding through dealer showrooms, keeping most buyers waiting at least six weeks for delivery of a car that is carving its own market niche. Since its formal introduction last May, the Probe, built beside the <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> MX-6 at <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s Flat Rock plant south of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, is being sold three months in advance of assembly line runs, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Windecker </PERSON> said. Delivery time can vary depending on particulars like color. The American car-buying public got a dose of what <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> had in mind months before its formal introduction. The news media, specifically the automotive magazines, sang the car's praises. `` By the time the cars were introduced, more than one-third of the car-buying age populace was aware of the car,'' <PERSON> Windecker </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think there's been that much excitement about a domestic car since a Taurus,'' another <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> that was introduced in December 1985, said <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Fusco </PERSON>, an auto analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> `` They did a lot of advance promotion for the car in magazines,'' she said. `` I thought that was a pretty sophisticated send-off. I think they did a good job promoting it, and I think the car is selling itself.'' Probe's base price is $ 11,490 with a 2.2 liter, four-cylinder engine. The car, with hidden headlamps and a swept-back rear deck, can be upgraded with a turbocharged engine and option packages to $ 17,292. Earlier this summer, scores of Probes reached the end of the assembly line at Flat Rock needing repairs. <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> quality control manager <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouck </PERSON> said the quality problems were created when a second shift was added at the plant _ a joint-venture between <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> _ and some workers were retrained and moved from one shift to another. <PERSON> Bouck </PERSON>, who moved to <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> has more stringent quality demands than some other automakers. That can result in more cars landing in repair lots before being shipped to dealers. `` Our repair inventory is about 300 now,'' he said. Despite those problems, Probe sales have grown at a steady clip _ about 600 cars more are sold each month than in the preceding one. No one at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> would reveal projected sales figures, but <PERSON> Windecker </PERSON> said demand has outstripped those projections. It's too early to tell exactly where Probe will fit into the American car market. `` They are creating a different niche for themselves,'' <PERSON> Fusco </PERSON> said. But, she cautioned, `` I think you have to be really careful when you're creating a niche. `` Look what <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> did with <PERSON> Fiero </PERSON>,'' she said, referring to the Pontiac two-seater that sold well in its first few years on the market before falling off dramatically. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> stopped making the car earlier this year. Analysts said the Probe has capitalized on the No. 2 and most profitable automaker's strengths _ solid design, careful marketing and reliability. `` They have done many things right,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, an analyst with the <ORGANIZATION> Pershing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` It's a combination of many, many little factors, some borrowed from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, some from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and some borrowed from <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION>. `` Combine that with a nice fit in its product mix ... and you've got a very successful car,'' <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said Like other newly introduced cars, Probe's engineering initially may take a back seat to its looks. `` What is there out there in that price range that looks that neat?'' asked <PERSON> Fusco </PERSON>. `` I think people buy cars because they look good, and secondarily because the quality is good and the warranty is good.'' Like other Fords, Probe carries a one-year bumper-to-bumper warranty and a six-year, 60,000-mile powertrain warranty. <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON> of the Center for Auto Safety, an industry watchdog group in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said no complaints about Probe have been received, but she said the car is too new to the market have much history, good or bad. Probe owner <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Aiken </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pleasant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, about 20 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, has no complaints about her Probe GT Turbo. `` I love it,'' she said. `` It seems that I get places faster. I'm used to driving a van. I thought I would n't care for it because it was much smaller.'' In addition to the Probe and the van, she and her husband, <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Aiken </PERSON>, also have a <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corvette </ORGANIZATION>. The Probe, she said, is used for family transportation. Her two children, ages 9 and 12, `` argue over who's going to sit in front. We have to keep a chart on our refrigerator'' so the children know whose turn it is.

<HEAD>Zenith Dissidents: We Won't Meet With Company Execs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A group of dissident shareholders stated Sunday it would not meet with the <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> board of directors and repeated a pledge to try to dump directors and sell the company. `` I do n't think you need to go in and explain it,'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkins </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Brookhurst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partnership </ORGANIZATION> said of a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>. `` We've given them a specific proposal to enhance shareholder value: sell <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'' On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearlman </PERSON> invited <ORGANIZATION> Brookhurst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, which has a 6.1 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>, to a Sept. 26 board meeting, apparently to discuss the dissidents' desire to get new directors and sell the company. But in a letter to <PERSON> Pearlman </PERSON> made public Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> Brookhurst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> rejected the request for a meeting. The letter said <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> had waited too long to improve the company's bottom line, so a sale makes sense. `` It is the responsibility of the board and management to formulate a plan to enhance <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> share value,'' the letter says. `` After 3 -LCB- years of multimillion-dollar losses, shareowners are still waiting for the details of your plan.'' If <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> does not put iself on the market, <ORGANIZATION> Brookhurst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> wants other shareholders to vote in favor of trimming the board from 10 directors to six, retaining three directors and electing three Brookhurst nominees. `` Our nominees will then be pledged to sell the company,'' <PERSON> Harkins </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Brookhurst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> general counsel, said from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> was closed Sunday and spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> could not be reached for comment on the letter. In order to depose directors, <ORGANIZATION> Brookhurst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> is asking a federal judge in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> to strike a company bylaw that says all shareholders _ not just a majority _ must favor such a move. Based on its 26 million common shares outstanding, and a closing stock price of $ 21.75 a share on Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> would have a market value of more than $ 565 million. <ORGANIZATION> Brookhurst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, formed by <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abelow </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ihasz </PERSON>, contends the bylaw is illegal. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>, a Delaware-chartered corporation, is based in <LOCATION> Glenview </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pearlman </PERSON> has said repeatedly since April that the board was `` exploring all options'' for returning the company to profitability. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>, the last remaining <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television manufacturer, has been fighting a losing battle against low-priced imported televisions. Despite the success of its highly regarded computers, <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> suffered losses over the past three years, including $ 19.1 million last year on sales of $ 2.36 billion. `` We've spoken to major shareholders and they've shared our views,'' <PERSON> Harkins </PERSON> said of the plan to sell the company.
