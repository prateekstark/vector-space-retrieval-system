 Hardwood paneling may lend a stately air to a courtroom, but environmental activists are angry that a new state courthouse will be decorated with 47,000 square feet of mahogany from shrinking rain forests. `` Our halls of justice should not be decorated through the death of tropical rain forests,'' <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said as he and other menbers of the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rainforest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> picketed the site Friday. The building on the Capitol mall will house the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> as well as most of the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> and other court-related agencies. The blueprints call for use of 32,880 square feet of -RCB- - inch plywood and 14,520 square feet of \ - inch mahogany plywood, according to Most mahogany comes from rain forests in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, and there are estimates that about five acres of rain forest disappear every minute to meet <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand for tropical timber. Environmentalists say destruction of the rain forests threatens the natural balance and is detroying the lives of many indigenous tribes. Chief Justice <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was n't available Friday, a state holiday, to comment on the issue, and the vice chief justice, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON>, did n't return calls to his <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> homes. The demonstrators said the government should send a signal by using maple, ash, or other hardwoods cut in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> added, `` I frankly do n't think using any kind of hardwood is going to make a better justice system.''

 More and more Israeli army reservists are coming up with a wide variety of excuses to avoid duty in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to put down the Palestinian uprising known as the intefadah. One reservist, identifying himself as <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON>, a 25-year-old architecture student, said he invented `` psychological problems'' to get out of serving. `` There is a limit to what I will do,'' he said. `` If I killed a Palestinian kid, I do n't think I could live with it.'' Others called up arrive at induction centers on crutches or with letters from employers saying they are too essential to the business to be let go. Some claim illness. It is what Israelis call a `` gray refusal'' _ getting out of duty without directly refusing to serve, which would challenge the pride that Israelis hold for their army. Some have legitimate excuses. Others feel their previous combat training is wasted on what they view as essentially police work. Still others believe the uprising is not a real military threat to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Most reservists interviewed said they would not hesitate to serve if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> faced a war or some other serious threat. `` But nobody feels threatened by the intefadeh,'' said <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreszin </PERSON>, a spokesman for the conscientious objectors' group Yesh Gvul. `` It's not like the Egyptian and Syrian tanks in 1973 where if we did n't stop them they would have made it to <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>.'' Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON>, the army's chief education officer, said 61 soldiers had been tried for refusing to serve in the occupied territories and he called it `` an ignorable number.'' `` I do believe that today there is no problem with the mission,'' he added. `` There are some refuseniks, who decline to serve in the territories. Those are the minority. The vast consensus is against them.'' The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> recently quoted senior army officers as estimating the number who avoid service in the territories has grown into the `` thousands.'' `` What is significant about this new phenomena is that it includes those who do n't usually try to evade service, like senior officers and guys from elite units,'' said <PERSON> Ariela </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, a reporter on military affairs for the newspaper. Virtually all Israeli men and women serve two to three years of mandatory service starting at age 18. Men continue in the reserve until age 56, and it is estimated the army can triple its size by calling up 370,000 reservists within a few days. Since the uprising began in December 1987, seven <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers have been killed, including a 28-year-old reservist whose skull was crushed by a stone dropped from a roof by a Palestinian. At least 600 Arabs have been killed by soldiers or <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> civilians, and 33 Israeli civilians also have been slain. <PERSON> Dreszin </PERSON>, the conscientious objector who has not been called up during the uprising but served 63 days in jail for refusing service in the <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> war, said some reservists avoid service by using minor illnesses that they would disregard if called up for a real war. `` They exploit their illness,'' he said. `` They say to themselves, ` Why should I ignore my medical problems if they help me stay out of the territories?''' Reservists usually receive their call-up notices in the mail weeks in advance, so they have plenty of time to work out excuses. Letters from professors telling of upcoming exams are plentiful on call-up day, as well as those from employers and doctors. `` If you cry enough in the army they will say, ` Go home,' just to get rid of you; you are demoralizing,'' said a 32-year-old lawyer and father of three identifying himself only as <PERSON> Motti </PERSON>. There are other ways to get out of duty in the territories. One officer was indicted for accepting bribes from reservists to assign them to an `` easy posting.'' <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> also reported that one man called to duty fired a few rounds into the air and shouted, `` We're going to kill Arabs!'' His intent was to have officers declare him too unstable. Among soldiers who do serve in the territories, despite misgivings, some have found their own ways to protect their ideals. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, 29, a soft-spoken immigrant from <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, recently served 16 days in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city, but said he ignored orders to fire at stone throwers. `` Some of the guys were shooting at the kids as they got off the truck,'' he said. `` I shot at a garbage can.''

 Environmentalists will honor a farmer who won a battle of wits with bugs. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Szynal </PERSON>, a farmer in the western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> and chief mechanic at <ORGANIZATION> Woods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>, will be presented on Saturday with an award from the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> for a homemade device that vacuums bugs off potato plants. He developed the `` Beetle Eater'' two years ago at the request of another farmer, who did n't want to use pesticides. It can suck potato beetles off four rows of plants at one time as it is towed through a field. The machine can clean 50 to 70 acres of potatoes in a day and removes 75 to 95 percent of the beetles, according to <PERSON> Szynal </PERSON>. `` This farmer walked into my garage ... and said, ` You've got to invent something to take the bugs off the plant. The spray's killing me,''' <PERSON> Szynal </PERSON> said Thursday `` Ten days later I had a machine rolling.'' The key to the machine is a blower that dislodges the beetles; a vacuum hose then scoops them up. `` The <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> potato beetle likes to play dead as soon as it senses any noise or movement, that's why we had to add the blower to shake them up,'' <PERSON> Szynal </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Szynal </PERSON> has other inventions for the farm. There's a vacuum device that debugs strawberry plants, a plastic cutter that makes round holes in plastic ground covers for corn plants, and an automatic pickle picker. `` It used to be I'd put my whole week's pay into my inventions and be broke by Wednesday,'' he said.

<HEAD>With PM-East Germany, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The jagged, gray concrete wall that divides <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> is a Cold War symbol of freedom denied. It was built under the direction of <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> to stop the hemorrhage of East Germans fleeing to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> _ about 2.5 million escaped to freedom from 1949 until Aug. 13, 1961. Now, in one of history's ironies, the flight to freedom of hundreds of thousands of East Germans around the wall and through neighboring countries has forced the Communist government to back down and declare free travel will be allowed. And 77-year-old <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> has been swept out as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader by the exodus and by protests by East Germans demanding democratic reforms. The 15-foot-high structure cut through the city, dividing families, friend from friend, <PERSON> Berliner </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Berliner </LOCATION> and communism from capitalism. It drew American presidents like <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> who declared: `` Ich bin <PERSON> ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Berliner </PERSON>.'' It drew tourists like onlookers viewing the scene of a grim accident. Hundreds of brave East Germans tried to scale the wall or tunnel under it or crash through a checkpoint. Many died in the attempt. The 28-mile-long wall is only a part of elaborate fortifications that stretch all along the 860-mile border between <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. A barrier of barbed wire, armed guards, death strips and eerie lights that played over the border at night. But it was the cold concrete wall in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, which is surrounded by East German territory, that became the symbol. `` We kept telling ourselves, ` You can not put a wall right through a major city,'' said <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Haar </PERSON> on the wall's 25th anniversary. `` Now we're used to it.'' Visiting presidents and prime ministers climbed a special stand to peer over the wall into <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Many called for the wall to be dismantled. But <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> insisted they dared not open the wall. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> said time and again: `` The wall will remain as long as the conditions that led to is construction endure.'' With the political change sweeping in from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and striking reforms taking place in nearby <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, the discredited and hard-line East German was finally overwhelmed by a popular revolt. From barbed wire and simple barricades started in 1961, the wall has grown in some areas to a pair of parallel concrete barriers with a `` death strip'' in between. Many escape attempts have ended with freedom-seekers lying dead in the shadows of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall or somewhere along the frontier between the two countries. Running, driving and even swimming, thousands of people have been caught trying to flee from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> over the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall or across fortifications along the border with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Mention of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall conjures up memories not only of desperate escape attempts, but also of major spy swaps between East and West. For years, border guards watching out for escapes had shoot-to-kill orders, but earlier this year the East Germans announced the orders had been lifted. According to West German statistics, up until recently as many as 4,000 people were held in East German jails and prisons in connection with failed escape attempts. The East German government has since pardoned them and they are to be released by the end of the month. The Aug. 13 <ORGANIZATION> Working </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> organization that tracks human rights abuses in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, estimates a total of 191 people were killed trying to flee <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> between 1961 and 1988. In the first few months after the wall was erected, 14 trucks rammed holes in the barrier. In September 1962, 147 people dug under the wall in the largest of several successful tunnel escapes. In 1983, two young men used an archery bow to fire a cable over the wall from an attic to an accomplice on a rooftop in the West. They attached pulleys to the cable and rode in the dark over the heads of guards to the West.

J.L. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said officers believed at least one man was trapped and killed in the fire that destroyed two apartment buildings and heavily damaged two others. Officials gave conflicting estimates of the number of injured ranging from four to 12 people. `` My first officer on the scene said he heard screams, but the building was engulfed in flames and he could n't get in,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. By late Thursday night, however, authorities had accounted for everyone in the two buildings that were destroyed and found no bodies in nine of 12 apartment units whose occupants had not been located, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Cobb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> emergency management director. Five people were unaccounted for in the remaining three apartments, which were to be searched later in the night. Capt. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Brogdon </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Smyrna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said several injuries were serious. Among the injured was the pilot, who was in critical condition with burns and internal injuries after ejecting from the plane. Authorities said the A-7E Corsair II attack jet crashed shortly after 6 p.m. into the Pine Village Apartments off <LOCATION> Windy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>, a heavily traveled thoroughfare lined with scores of apartment complexes and businesses. Witnesses said the plane landed in a parking lot, setting several cars on fire and spewing burning fuel over the buildings. The fire was under control about two hours after the crash. Several witnesses said the jet exploded in the air. `` I saw it out my kitchen window. It was stable, then it just exploded in the air and went straight down,'' said <PERSON> Tawanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, who lives in an adjacent apartment complex. `` When I went outside, I saw a ball of fire heading toward the ground,'' said eyewitness <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. `` After the second or third explosion, the pilot ejected himself from the seat.'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said he saw the pilot's parachute deploy when he was just about 100 feet above the ground. `` When I got to the pilot to give him CPR, he had multiple contusions and was bleeding profusely from the nose and mouth. I gave him CPR and got him as comfortable as possible.'' <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Honore </PERSON> said the pilot, a Naval reservist, was attempting to land at <ORGANIZATION> Dobbins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, about 15 miles north of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, but crashed 2.5 miles short of the runway. The jet is based at the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>, which is located at <LOCATION> Dobbins </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Honore </PERSON>, who said the plane carried no ammunition, could not confirm that the jet exploded in the air. He said authorities did not know what caused the crash. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, Cmdr. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, said he presumed the plane was on a routine training mission. <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmiedt </PERSON>, who lives two miles from the complex, said she heard two explosions and her TV blinked off. `` I went to door and saw flames in the air. -LRB- I -RRB- went over there and -LRB- the place -RRB- was just totally engulfed in flames,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Schmiedt </PERSON>, a nurse, ran to the scene and offered help. `` It was a horrible sight. I'm convinced there are people still in their apartments they have n't found.'' A resident of the apartment complex, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Finch </PERSON>, said he escaped from the building along with his wife. He said he saw a woman and a girl run out from another unit engulfed in flames. `` I do n't think the husband made it out,'' <PERSON> Finch </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>, 21, said he had been away from his apartment visiting friends. `` I got back in time just to see my apartment on fire,'' he said. `` It's gone. There's nothing left.'' He said he was searching for a friend who he thinks was at home. `` I do n't know if he's dead or alive,'' <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION> Fire Chief <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> originally said 12 people, including the pilot, were injured. But <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> later said he was lowering the count to four. A check at area hospitals also indicated four people were injured. <PERSON> Brogdon </PERSON>, however, said police were standing by their earlier count of seven injured. He said some of the injured might not have been admitted to hospitals. Most of the injured were taken to <ORGANIZATION> Kennestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitals </ORGANIZATION>, two sister medical centers in <LOCATION> Marietta </LOCATION>, as a huge traffic jam of emergency vehicles, rush-hour commuters and curiosity seekers quickly developed. The pilot, a reservist who was not identified, was in critical condition after undergoing surgery late Thursday night, said <PERSON> Kennestone </PERSON> official <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballew </PERSON>. A 28-year-old woman and her 5-year-old daughter were in critical condition with burns at <LOCATION> Grady </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Grady </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. The mother was identified as 28-year-old <PERSON> Margie </PERSON> <PERSON> Padovani </PERSON> by <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Padgett </PERSON>, a spokeswoman at <LOCATION> Kennestone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where the two were taken initally. <PERSON> Ballew </PERSON> said another woman was being treated for minor injuries at <ORGANIZATION> Kennestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Windy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, a sister hospital of <LOCATION> Kennestone </LOCATION>. Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, a friend of the pilot, said he flew the same plane earlier Thursday on a separate training mission. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said it was in `` beautiful'' shape at the time. He said he does n't have any idea what might have causd the crash. He said he and the pilot, who still had not been unidentified, both work at <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> and had put in time with the reserves. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said he has known the pilot for about three years and described him as a `` capable, excellent'' pilot. Asked whether the pilots worry when they fly over heavily populated areas during training missions, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said, `` It's a concern. You have a tremendous concern for the people around here.'' The A-7E, which entered service as the A-7 in the 1965, is a single-seat attack aircraft used for a variety of bombing missions on land and at sea. The current version has undergone a number of modifications. The A-7E has a 20mm gun and can carry payloads of up to 15,000 pounds of bombs and missiles. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> records indicate that A-7E Corsair IIs were part of the two-carrier battle group that conducted a joint strike on selected Libyan terrorist-related targets in 1986. Together with carrier-based F-A-18s, A-7s used anti-radar missiles to neutralize air defenses.

<HEAD>Shakespeare's Four Folios Fetch $2 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A set of the first four successive editions of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s collected plays was sold Thursday for $ 2 million, a record for what are known as the `` Four Folios,'' Sotheby's said. Apart from an unfinished attempt in 1619 to publish a collected issue of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s plays, the Folios were the only collected editions printed in the 17th Century, according to the auction catalog. `` I never paid $ 2 million for anything before,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cummins </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> dealer who bought the Folios for a customer he would identify only as a private American collector. `` I'm a little nervous but excited.'' <PERSON> Cummins </PERSON> said he and his customer had been looking for at least the first Folio for about five years. `` The first Folio is the first collected works of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>,'' he explained. `` The four together are exceedingly desirable, but the first Folio is the one that you're really paying a premium to get because it's almost impossible to find a fine copy and this is a very, very nice copy indeed.'' A first edition of the two volumes of `` El ingenioso hidalgo <PERSON> don </PERSON> <PERSON> Quixote </PERSON> de la Mancha,'' by <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cervantes </PERSON> <PERSON> Saavedra </PERSON>, sold for $ 1.65 million to a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> dealer, said a <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Weigman </PERSON>. A first edition of <PERSON> Nicolaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Copernicus </PERSON>' `` De revolutionibus orbium coelestium,'' dated 1543, in which he first put forth the theory that the sun is at the center of the planets, sold for $ 473,000 to an Italian dealer. The same dealer paid the same price for what <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s said is the only copy in private hands of the first edition of the first printed announcement of <PERSON> Copernicus </PERSON>'s heliocentric theory. `` De libris revolutionum ... <PERSON> Nicolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Copernici </PERSON> ... narratio prima,'' was written by <PERSON> Georg </PERSON> <PERSON> Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> Rheticus </PERSON> in 1540. The works in Thursday's sale, which drew $ 10.4 million, came from <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Garden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> collection of books and manuscripts relating to the history of ideas. It was amassed by <PERSON> Haven </PERSON> <PERSON> O'More </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> over more than 25 years as part of a publishing venture, <PERSON> Weigman </PERSON> said. The sale continues Friday.

<TEXT>
 The Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s eldest son told the Rev. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> that the former King aide's book about his father was unfair, a newspaper said In an interview Thursday to be published in Friday's editions of The Tennessean, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said he had spoken with <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> following the dedication of the Civil Rights Memorial in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION> `` I told him I have always been taught to love people and I still love you,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. `` I said, ` I think your treatment of my father was unfair.' But I told him I loved him and I always will.'' It was believed to be the first time a member of the King family had talked to <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> since the publication of his autobiography, `` And The Walls Came Tumbling Down.'' <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON>, 63, was president of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> from 1968 to 1977 and was King's closest aide during the civil rights movement. He wrote that King spent the night with two women and fought with a third in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> the night before he was assassinated by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>. <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON>'s account has been condemned and disputed by other associates of King. After the memorial on the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poverty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> grounds was dedicated Sunday, <PERSON> King </PERSON> said he took <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON>'s hand and called him `` Uncle <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON>.'' `` What I was doing in speaking to him was in no way to express any malicious sentiment. It was a concerned sentiment. It was just human nature to speak to him,'' said King. He said he spoke for himself and not other members of his family. Because of the negative reaction to his book, <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> was excluded from the speaker's platform during the ceremonies honoring King and 39 others slain in the struggle for civil rights. After the speeches, <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> rushed up the stairs and began shaking hands with people on the platform. He and King spoke briefly. <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> told The Tennessean on Thursday that King called him `` Uncle <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON>,'' and said <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> had embarrassed his family and him. <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> said he loves <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, and said he will be writing him and talking to him in the future. `` I will tell him that his father was my dearest friend,'' <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> said. `` I am a part of him. A part of me went on the trip with him. He was my best buddy.'' `` He was a human being,'' <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> said. `` He was frail, just as all of us are. I want to tell his children that.''

<TEXT>
 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> is about to make his first trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and he says the prospect leaves him `` trembling.'' Simultaneously nervous about leaving <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> for too long and fearful of disappointing his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hosts with a visit that's too short, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that he sees <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s future hinging at least in part on how he does during seven busy days in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. The journey, which begins in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and winds up in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, is highlighted by two meetings with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and a speech to a joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Nov. 15, where <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> will appeal for economic aid and investment in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. When asked what his message was for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> replied: `` We need Columbuses from the States to come and discover <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, to clear the trail. First clear the trail, clear it like <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>. ... Then there will an influx of millionaires. Because there is business to be done here.'' The former shipyard electrician who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983 and engineered the formation of the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first non-communist government will be among the few people who were not heads of a government or state to address <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Other private people so honored included Revolutionary War hero <PERSON> Marquis </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFayette </PERSON> and <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>, after he left office. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, a guest of <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> and the union federation, arrives in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Monday and leaves for <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> Nov. 19. `` Any trip to the States shorter than one month is no good,'' a harried but bantering <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said in the interview in his <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> office before his departure. With the limited time at his disposal, `` I will disappoint many, and that it why it is not a good trip and a trip which is dangerous for me. I can not satisfy Americans in such a short time. I can not thank Americans enough. It is physically impossible,'' he said. In addition, he said he is burdened by the prospect of something going wrong in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> while he is away. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, whose mother and stepfather lived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, canceled a trip in 1981 because the political situation was too unstable. Martial law was imposed a few months later. He seems to have similar fears about being away too long now, even with his friend <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> sitting comfortably at the helm of government and scores of his union colleages filling the benches of parliament. `` Whatever bad happens _ knock wood, it could _ will be all blamed on me,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. `` That I did it deliberately, that I did not anticipate it. ... That is why I am trembling. In these conditions I can not make a good visit.'' At a time when <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> would seem able to savor the fruits of his victories in 1989 _ Solidarity regained legal status, swept all the parliament races it entered and took over the government in a once-unimaginable defeat for the Communists _ he claims to be more burdened than ever. By comparison, his lonely work as an organizer of free trade unions in the late 1970s and his years of internment and surveillance after Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s martial-law crackdown were `` easy, like playing in the boy scouts,'' he said. `` I think that the difficult things are only coming now. Let's not forget that we are building something now, we are building an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> But can we anticipate everything? ... This will be the danger.'' He also sees a personal danger for himself _ the swift passage of time and the unlikelihood that he can lay his burdens down soon. `` I do n't like what I am doing,'' he said. `` I was born a free man, and now what's offered me is slavery. ... I felt better when I was a prisoner than I do now that I am free. Then I could lay down and rest. And now it is like being under arrest even at home. I can not even walk outside. Somebody is immediately on me. `` And so time is running out. I want to live a little, and I do n't know if it is possible anymore.'' He also worries a bit that his political wits may be getting dull. `` So far it is not too bad. But I do n't know. I am getting older, but I am trying to save myself. I am doing calisthenics now because I am starting to feel exhausted. Maybe I weigh too much. Just to stretch it out, I have started wearing jeans, pretending to be 18 years old. I do sports to extend my life. I do n't know if it is going to work.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he thought communism was finished `` a long time ago.'' `` But it all depends on what we understand by ` communism' If you understand the monopoly of one party, a monopoly over everything, then that has been over for a long time. It can not be maintained.'' But if communism was to find a way to stop limiting freedom and pluralism and correct `` a few other minor things,'' then `` it might not be entirely a stupid ideology someday, when people forget about all its sins.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Torsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryl </PERSON> had been a Berliner all 24 years of his life. But until early today, he had never seen the other half of the divided city. Suddenly, all it took was a flash of his identity card. `` At the stroke of midnight, they told us, ` The procedure has been shortened, and all you need is a stamp,''' said <PERSON> Ryl </PERSON>, a waiter, still awestruck at his sudden crossing into the West through Checkpoint <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON>. `` It's not my intention to stay here, but we have to have the possibility to come over here and go back again,'' <PERSON> Ryl </PERSON> said. `` I have my apartment and my car over there.'' A middle-aged West German reached over, gave him 20 marks -LRB- $ 11 -RRB- and said with a grin: `` Why do n't you go get yourself a beer first?'' In what seemed like a fantasy, thousands of Berliners today strolled through the other half of the city where <LOCATION> Communist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> had denied them free passage for 28 years. <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> and <PERSON> Katarina </PERSON> <PERSON> Erdmann </PERSON> said they briefly left their three sleeping children at home in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. `` We just wanted to go for a stroll,'' <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Erdmann </PERSON> said. `` It's crazy.'' West Berliners also crossed eastward. Germans from both sides held impromptu dances atop the wall, hoisting people up from both sides to join them. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Moll </PERSON> said he was allowed to cross into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> in less than five minutes. `` I just ca n't believe it,'' he said. `` A lot of people thought it was just another trick.'' <PERSON> Moll </PERSON>, 21, said he also intended to return home after having a look around <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. He reluctantly gave his name to reporters. `` You're not from <LOCATION> Stasi </LOCATION>, are you?'' he asked, referring to the East German state security service. It seemed as if each <PERSON> East </PERSON> <PERSON> Berliner </PERSON> who crossed the demarcation line was greeted with cheers _ many by hugs and kisses _ by the crowd at Checkpoint Charlie. Traffic jams built up on the western side of the checkpoint, and people with sparklers and champagne bottles streamed out of the Kochstrasse subway stop on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> side to join the party. Thousands celebrated on the Kurfuerstendamm, a boulevard in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s upscale shopping district. East German Trabant cars were welcomed by cheers and honking horns as they slowly wended their way down the boulevard, which for one night was the scene of the wildest celebrations since the Berlin Wall was born in the Cold War. `` This is a historic day!'' one man yelled. `` We're going to be able to tell our children about this!''

The 24-year-old woman says she was raped a knifepoint. Lord was first indicted in the case in January, but Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Smeal </PERSON> said a new indictment was issued to change the language of the aggravated assault charge. A six-member jury in <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, found Lord innocent of charges last month that he raped a 22-year-old woman at knife point after abducting her from a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> restaurant parking lot in November 1988. Several jurors said the woman enticed Lord with skimpy clothing, including a lace miniskirt with no underwear. `` She was obviously dressed for a good time, but we felt she may have bit off more than she could chew,'' juror <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradshaw </PERSON> said following the verdict, which unleashed outrage around the nation from sexual assualt counselors and women's groups. The woman, wearing various disguises, has appeared on several national talks shows to discuss the case. During the trial, Lord's attorney told jurors that the woman agreed to have sex with Lord in exchange for $ 100 and cocaine.

<HEAD>Gasoline Vapors Unhealthy, Consumer Group Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A consumer group is calling for tighter controls on toxic gasoline vapors, saying that motorists who pump their own gas are being exposed to unhealthy levels of cancer-causing benzene and other pollutants. Citizen Action, a Washington-based organization that focuses on consumer and environmental issues, accused the oil companies Thursday of ignoring health concerns by increasing levels of benzene and other aromatic hydrocarbons in unleaded gasoline to boost its octane rating. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement that disputed the claims and accused Citizen Action of raising `` unwarranted fears about motorists' exposure to gasoline.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged that toxic vapors from gasoline at the pump are a health concern, but an agency spokesman suggested the claims raised by Citizen Action on health impact may be exaggerated. Nevertheless, said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration proposal for tightening federal air quality laws calls for better vapor-capturing devices such as sleeves or hoods on gasoline pumps. It also would require oil companies to produce gasoline that releases less vapor pollutants. Several localities already require vapor-control hoods on gasoline pumps, but the devices have been controversial because they have been found to be cumbersome and unpopular in many cases. Benzene, which has been shown to cause leukemia, appears in petroleum products such as gasoline and its vapors. It also is generated during combustion and releases through motor vehicle tailpipes. The report by Citizen Action claimed that motorists are exposed to benzene levels of more than 1 part per million when refueling their cars _ a level expected to result, according to several studies, in at least two additional cancer cases over a lifetime per 1 million people exposed. It said a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> study suggested even higher exposures. `` Despite the scientific evidence demonstrating that human exposure to benzene increases the risk of contracting cancer, oil companies have neither adequately warned consumers, nor acted to responsibly reduce benzene levels,'' said the citizen group. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON>, energy and environmental policy director for Citizen Action, said the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> `` has sat on its hands for the last 13 years and has done nothing to regulate mobile sources of benzene,'' although it recently announced regulations to curb benzene releases from industrial facilities and storage tanks. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the oil industry's trade group, denounced the <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> claims, calling the allegations `` a disservice to the consumers it purports to represents.'' <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Ensz </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said consumers' exposure to benzene at service stations is for `` only a few minutes a week -LRB- and -RRB- typically to low levels.'' The trade group accused Citizen Action of trying `` to raise unwarranted fears'' among motorists. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> recently announced tighter controls on benzene emissions from a variety of sources from industrial plants to storage facilities because chronic exposure is believed to cause leukemia. But the new regulations do not cover emissions from motor vehicles, which the agency says accounts for about 80 percent of the benzene releases. Most of the releases from gasoline occur through vehicle tailpipes during fuel combustion, but a substantial amount also is released through gasoline vapors with exposure being greatest at service stations when motorists are refueling, environmental studies have said. Citizen Action is a Washington-based federation of citizen groups that claims more than 2 million members in 25 states. It focuses on a variety of consumer, environmental and health issues.

 Opponents of smoking aboard airliners are on the verge of winning their fight to forbid passengers from lighting up on practically all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flights. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by voice vote Thursday passed a prohibition against cigarette smoking on all but a handful of domestic flights. Tobacco-state lawmakers, long convinced they were badly outnumbered, made no comments on the prohibition. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved the ban, included in a $ 12 billion transportation bill for the new fiscal year, on Oct. 31. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will continue debate on the spending measure Tuesday and will send it to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his signature if no changes in the legislation are made. `` Approval of this law is a milestone in the efforts to protect those who do n't want to put themselves at risk by inhaling other people's smoke,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, the measure's sponsor The new restrictions permanently forbid smoking on all routes within the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and on all flights to and from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> scheduled for six hours or less. The current ban _ which expires next April _ applies only to routes lasting two hours or less, covering 80 percent of all flights. Smoking would remain legal on only about 28 of the 17,500 daily scheduled <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flights, according to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> sponsor of the measure, Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Durbin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>. Uncovered would be 24 flights each day to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and four to Guam. <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON> and his allies, citing studies by the surgeon general's office and other sources, have argued that it is unhealthy to breathe cigarette fumes from smokers. Tobacco industry supporters insist cigarette smoke is only one chemical in airline cabin air, which is recirculated. They have argued <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should not act until the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> completes a study next year on the components of cabin air. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has essentially acted in an informational vacuum,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Merryman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the cigarette industry's trade group. <PERSON> Cigar </PERSON> and pipe smoking aboard airliners has been illegal since 1983.

<HEAD>It's an Ethics Package, Not a Pay Raise</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ask House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> about plans for a 33 percent congressional pay hike and his response reflects the barrage of semantics that is a key part of many lawmakers' strategy `` Are you talking about the ethics package?'' he says. And the initial 7.7 percent raise members would receive on Jan. 1 is a `` cost-of-living adjustment, not a pay raise,'' he says. `` If you are talking about a pay adjustment, no one is proposing to do that in this Congress.'' Ten months after public uproar drove lawmakers to kill a proposed 51 percent salary increase for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the judiciary and top executive branch jobs, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders are charging ahead with a new mix of semantics and timing, public policy and financial self-interest. House members would within 14 months see their salaries rise from $ 89,500 to more than $ 120,000. The initial pay boost is billed as a cost-of-living adjustment to make up for two years of inflation without an increase. The bulk of the raise, a 25 percent boost, would be delayed until Jan. 1, 1991, after the next <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is elected. At that time, lawmakers would be banned from keeping money from speeches before interest groups. It was <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Madison </PERSON> who suggested that the Constitution bar lawmakers from approving pay increases to take effect in the same <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is not the same old saw,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>, D-Calif., who along with Rep. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, R-Ill., led a bipartisan panel that fashioned the Other ethics reforms would include requiring members to disclose more about their personal finances and new restrictions on the gifts they could receive. Final details of the package were being negotiated this week between Republicans and Democrats in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and with the White House. The new proposal also would be handled in a more straightforward way than earlier this year, when former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> tried to force the 51 percent pay hike into effect without a vote. On this one, members will be forced to record their views. `` Clearly the package that's before us now is substantially better,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, a leader of the effort to defeat the earlier proposal. <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON> said he would not actively oppose the new plan, but he would n't vote for it. Among his reasons is the inclusion of the pay increase starting in January. `` It is very difficult, I think, to explain to people back home that a cost of living adjustment is not a pay raise,'' said <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON>, who is running for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON> and others said it was bad timing for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to consider a pay raise before it has taken steps to correct massive budgetary problems. The failure to enact a deficit-reduction bill this year has required the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, under the Gramm-Rudman law, to order across-the-board spending cuts. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said this week it could be forced to reduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troop strength by tens of thousands. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> on Thursday said he was willing to put forward the pay-and-ethics plan before a fiscal settlement, but others said that would be a mistake. `` There is no question in my mind -LRB- that -RRB- if we can not eliminate the across-the-board cuts, there is no chance members are going to vote for a pay raise,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., who is working to complete the deficit bill Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said many members, including himself, would be very cautious about voting for a pay raise. `` I do n't think there's anything about this thing that's popular,'' he said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has indicated a willingness to accept a raise, since he badly wants to increase salaries for federal judges and his top political appointees in the administration. Senators, however, have little desire to risk anything for a pay boost. They generally have more personal wealth than their <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> colleagues and their rules let them keep honoraria equal to 40 percent of their salaries, compared to 30 percent in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> _ and senators have a much easier time lining up speeches. `` There's not a lot of support in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for a pay raise,'' Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said Thursday. House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders have discussed the possibility that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> might accept the initial 7.7 percent raise but, for its own members, eschew the later installment. On board or not, members are getting the message. `` It's an ethics package. It's not a pay raise,'' quipped Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Buechner </PERSON>, R-Mo., when he was asked for a stance `` If you ca n't get the jargon down ...''

 House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats, with the help of a maverick Republican senator, are setting the stage for a new showdown with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> over child care subsidies. Negotiators from the two congressional bodies reached agreement Thursday night on legislation that would increase direct federal child care subsidies to low - and moderate-income families by $ 1.2 billion in 1990 and by up to $ 8.5 billion over the next five years The accord was struck after Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, dropped his demand that states be allowed to issue vouchers for a new $ 300 million program to pay for keeping schools open longer hours to provide day care and establish a new education-driven program for pre-school tots. `` At least we have a running shot now with a bill that the president might not veto,'' said <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, who angered the administration, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and conservative groups by joining with liberal Democrats last spring in putting together the basic package. In exchange, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats agreed to allow more of the money to go to rural areas at governors' discretion and let states issue vouchers that parents could use to pay for day care services provided by churches. A separate group of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators still must reach accord on another provision included in the child care package that would increase tax credits for poor families with children by $ 500 to $ 750 a year. But <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leaders instructed the chairmen of their tax-writing committees Thursday to try to settle differences over that portion by Monday night in a drive to get a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote by the end of next week. `` We're going to move on the child care bill as a separate item ... and we hope to see an early enactment of it,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash. His counterpart in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said the same effort will be made there, but acknowledged it will be more difficult to accomplish before adjourning for Thanksgiving, under <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rules `` Our problem is there's Republican opposition,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` They're opposed to passing it any time, this year or next.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved its version of the bill by a 63-37 margin in June over fierce opposition from the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> GOP Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. A companion measure was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last month as part of a bill aimed a bringing down the federal deficit in fiscal 1990, which began Oct. 1. With public opinion polls indicating a large majority of Americans favor federal aid for child care, Democrats and <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> hope that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would not veto the bill. But if he does, said Rep. <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will pass the same measure again early next year at the opening of the 1990 election cycle `` It's going to be pretty damned hard to get anybody in 1990 to vote against child care,'' said <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>. No one knows exactly how much of the federal block grants to states are now spent on child care subsidies, but estimates range from $ 400 million to $ 1 billion a year. Under the compromise reached Thursday, those block grants would be augmented with a new $ 750 million program of child care subsidies with a mandate that states regulate care providers. Another $ 150 million would be added to the Head Start pre-school program that now reaches about half a million 3 - and 4-year-olds each year with the aim of turning those facilities into all-day, year-round child care centers <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has adamantly opposed making states regulate day care centers and has insisted that any new aid be limited to tax credits for poor families with children under age 4 and a slight expansion of Head Start funding.

 Four million Americans may have Alzheimer's disease _ 1.5 million more than had been thought _ according to findings that suggest the disease and its treatment will `` weigh heavily on our future. A study of 3,623 elderly people in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> indicates one in 10 of them probably had Alzheimer's disease, which robs people of their memories and their ability to function, researchers said. The rates of Alzheimer's grew rapidly higher with advancing age, as nearly half of those older than 85 suffer from it, said the researchers, led by Dr. <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Based on the study's results, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> on Aging revised its estimate of how many people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> suffer from Alzheimer's from 2.5 million to 4 million. The institute issued a statement saying the study is unique because it involved large numbers of people, including those living in their own homes or with their families, and it included people with few or no memory problems. `` As a result, these estimates might lay the groundwork for developing the most accurate picture of Alzheimer's disease in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population to date,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Zaven </PERSON> <PERSON> Khachaturian </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NIA </ORGANIZATION> associate director for neuroscience and neuropsychology of aging. Results of the study, partly financed by <ORGANIZATION> NIA </ORGANIZATION>, were published in today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` People that I see do not realize that this is an extremely prevalent condition, that it is an epidemic that is going to weigh heavily on our future,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Naughton </PERSON>, geriatrics chief at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> has estimated that from 1980 to the year 2000, the number of people 90 years old and up will increase 236 percent, to 1.9 million, <PERSON> Naughton </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> study consisted of giving brief memory tests to 81 percent of the 65-and-older population of east <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> beginning in 1982, and conducting more extensive psychiatric and laboratory testing on 467 of the individuals. Of people 65 to 74 years old, 3 percent had `` probable'' Alzheimer's disease, compared with 18.7 percent of those 75 to 84 years old and 47.2 percent of those over 85, said the study. `` Everyone in our study, whether they had Alzheimer's disease or not, was living in the community, not in institutions,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> noted in a telephone interview. `` They may have had impaired function, far from perfect function, but they were able to live in the community.'' Victims of Alzheimer's disease often end up in nursing homes, but <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> called for finding ways to allow Alzheimer's sufferers to stay in the community with their families. Alzheimer's disease is a degenerative illness of the brain and nervous system with no known cause, no cure and no effective treatment, save medication to treat the depression that sometimes accompanies it. The disease usually is fatal within 5 to 10 years, according to <PERSON> Naughton </PERSON>, who said its first symptom is typically memory loss, followed by speech difficulties and a tendency to lose one's way even in familiar surroundings. Alzheimer's later robs people of their ability to cook and care for themselves, as well as exaggerating their personality traits _ such as hot-temperedness or passivity. The illness eventually confines victims to bed and renders them unable to respond to their environment, <PERSON> Naughton </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> study `` points out the need for further research, because the problem is greater than formerly recognized,'' said <PERSON> Creighton </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON>, vice president of medical and scientific affairs for the Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Alzheimer </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a research and family-support group. <PERSON> Naughton </PERSON> said <PERSON> Alzheimer </PERSON>'s research is relatively well funded compared with financial support for training physicians to care for Alzheimer's victims. `` We're very poorly prepared in the medical profession to deal with chronic care,'' he said.

<HEAD>US and Soviet Grain Harvests Larger Than Predicted</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 American and Soviet farmers are both producing more grain this year than experts figured a month ago. This year's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn crop, for example, is estimated by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> at a three-year high of 7.59 billion bushels, up 54 percent from last year's drought-reduced crop and up 2 percent from the forecast in October. Based on recent information out of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the department on Thursday also boosted its estimate of 1990 total grain production by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to 208 million metric tons, up three million from October indications. On a metric basis, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn harvest is estimated at 192.8 million tons. And total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain output this year _ not counting 52.7 million tons of soybeans _ is about 284 million tons. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels of corn, or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. In October, the department estimated this year's production at 7.45 billion bushels, a 51 percent increase from last year's drought-reduced 4.92 billion bushels Based on Nov. 1 surveys, the 7.59 billion bushels now forecast would be the largest since 8.25 billion bushels in 1986. The record was the 1985 crop of nearly 8.9 billion bushels. `` Harvest progressed rapidly in the 17 major producing states during October and was 88 percent complete by Nov. 5, compared with 91 percent last year and the average of 78 percent,'' the department's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. Corn yields were estimated at 116.6 bushels per acre harvested, up from 114.4 forecast in October and 84.6 bushels in 1988 but still below the record of 119.4 bushels per acre in 1987. As livestock feed, corn is the largest and most important <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm crop. It is essential for the production of meat, poultry and dairy products. Consumer food prices, which rose an average of 4.1 percent in 1988, are expected to go up about 6 percent this year, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> economists. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> has not issued its 1990 forecast, but some analysts tentatively believe food prices wo n't match this year's rise, the steepest since a 7.8 percent jump in 1981. Soybean production, a source of high-protein meal and vegetable oil, was estimated at 1.94 billion bushels, up 25 percent from last year's harvest of 1.54 billion bushels and 1 percent above the October estimate of 1.93 billion bushels. The record soybean output was 2.26 billion bushels in 1979. Yields were estimated at an average of 32.8 bushels per acre this year, compared with 26.9 bushels in 1988, the October forecast of 32.6 bushels and a record 34.1 bushels per acre in 1985. The department's all-crops production index was reported at 104 percent of its 1977 average used for comparison. Last year, reflecting the severe drought, the index plummeted to 89 percent. The record reading was 117 percent set in 1981, 1982 and 1985. Cotton production was indicated at 12.1 million bales, down 21 percent from last year's output and 2 percent below the September estimate of 12.3 million bales. The new estimate was up about 1 percent from October. The cotton record was 18.9 million bales in 1937. No new estimates of 1989 production of wheat and other crops harvested earlier were included in the report. In a related report on supply and demand for major commodities, analysts said total corn use in the 1989-90 marketing year that began on Sept. 1 is expected to be about 7.625 billion bushels, including domestic and export requirements, an increase from 7.5 billion forecast in October. With demand exceeding 1989 corn production, that will mean a further drawdown of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stockpiles to about 1.9 billion bushels left over by next Sept. 1, down from inventories estimated at 1.93 billion bushels at the beginning of the marketing year. Still, that represents only a slight dip in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn stockpile, compared to last season's decline, when it plummeted from 4.26 billion bushels on Sept. 1, 1988, to the 1.93 billion bushels on hand this Sept. 1. Analysts said total corn use in the coming year will be boosted by larger exports than had been anticipated, about 2.15 billion bushels instead of the 2 billion that was forecast last month. Larger imports by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are expected to account for much of the increase. According to the new estimate, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will import about 37 million tons of grain from all sources in 1989-90, up three million tons from the October forecast but still short of last year's 39 million tons. The report said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn prices may average in the range of $ 2 to $ 2.40 per bushel in the 1989-90 marketing year, down from $ 2.54 last season. The October forecast was $ 1.85 to $ 2.25 per bushel. Other 1989 crop estimates based on Oct. 1 indications, compared with 1988 output, included: _ Sorghum, 628.9 million bushels and an average yield of 59.8 bushels per acre, compared with 577.6 million and 63.8 in 1988 _ Rice, 156.4 million hundredweight and a yield of 5,697 pounds per acre, compared with 159.5 million and 5,511 _ Peanuts, 4.13 billion pounds and a yield of 2,523 pounds per acre, compared with 3.98 billion and 2,445 _ Potatoes, total, 367.3 million hundredweight and a yield of 292 hundredweight per acre, compared with 356.4 million and 283 _ Tobacco, 1.47 billion pounds and a yield of 2,105 pounds per acre, compared with 1.37 billion and 2,160 _ Sugarbeets, 26 million tons and a yield of 19.6 tons per acre, compared with 24.8 million and 19.1 _ Sugar cane, 30.4 million tons and a yield of 35.2 tons per acre, compared with 29.9 million and 35.4

<HEAD>New Debate Set For Bush's Capital Gains Tax Cut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Opponents of a capital gains tax reduction say new debate set in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is merely the `` death throes'' for the year for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s tax cut proposal. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> took the first step in the new round of debate Thursday, repassing without debate or dissent the same capital gains cut it had approved in September as part of a deficit-reduction bill. But <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders say the new debate will only put the issue to rest for the year. `` This is just part of the death throes of capital gains,'' said Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Tenn </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Only Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, spoke on the bill Thursday `` It removes this issue as an impediment to moving forward on budget reconciliation -LRB- deficit reduction -RRB- and other important matters,'' he said. Republicans will offer their own version of a capital gains cut in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the issue will be debated for a day or two. There likely will be two efforts to shut off debate on the bill. Although Republicans say most senators favor a cut, it is generally agreed backers will be unable to muster the 60 votes required to force a final vote. If, as expected, the second vote to limit debate fails, capital gains will be dead for the year. Senate Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> told reporters he would not attempt to attach the amendment to any other bill this year. Republicans agreed last week to stop trying to attach the reduction to debt-ceiling and deficit-reduction legislation. But they want to have next week's debate to keep the issue in the public eye in hopes of building support. Asked what chance the bill has of becoming law this year, <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> told reporters, `` None.'' Republicans say a cut in the tax on capital gains, which are profits from the sale of investments, would spur investment and create jobs. Democrats call it a tax cut for the wealthy and cite estimates that 80 percent of the benefit from a reduction would go to those with incomes more than $ 200,000 a year. The cut approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday would exclude from taxation 30 percent of the gains on assets sold before Dec. 31, 1991. After that, only gains resulting solely from inflation would be excluded. Present law fully taxes capital gains at the same rates applied to wages and other income. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> plan would allow an exclusion based on how long an asset was held. If property was owned for more than a year, 5 percent of the profit would be excluded from tax. The excluded portion would increase by 5 percentage points each year, up to a maximum of seven years. Thus, 35 percent of the profit from the sale of an asset owned more than seven years would escape taxation.

 Alzheimer's disease usually progresses in three broad stages, according to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Here are typical symptoms, as described by the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> and Dr. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Naughton </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>: _ Forgetfulness, frequently going unnoticed but causing anxiety or depression in the person affected _ Severe memory loss, with victims unable to remember recent visitors or what they saw on television, though they can remember long-ago events Accompanying this stage may be a tendency to get disoriented in time or space, to lose one's way or wander, and to lose the capacity to care for themselves. Also apparent may be an exaggeration of existing personality traits _ extreme anger if the person is normally hot-tempered, extreme passivity if the person is normally placid; or an extreme tendency to wander if the person is normally an `` on-the-go'' type. _ Severe confusion and disorientation, with possible hallucinations or delusions The sufferer may forget to eat, may lose control of bladder and bowel functions and may be bedridden and prone to repeated infections. A person usually lives five to 10 years after developing Alzheimer's disease, though the course of the uncurable illness may run from one to 20 years, <PERSON> Naughton </PERSON> said.

 Old soldiers die, but they never fade away at the old soldiers' home, where they celebrate Veterans Day with memories of glory past and make no apologies for the place they live. `` This is my home and I'm proud of it,'' says <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, 71, a two-year resident of the <ORGANIZATION> Barboursville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION>. `` I won $ 3 in bingo last night.'' <LOCATION> Barboursville </LOCATION> is one of many such homes in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> where veterans, often rebuilding lives broken by injuries and rejection, try to put things back together and relive tales of old battles. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> sent more soldiers per capita to the Korean War than any other state and the state's casualty rate in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> was the highest in the nation, 28.8 per 100,000 residents, according to federal statistics. Some say the state's traditionally poor economy pushes more soldiers to war; others attribute the figures to a fighting spirit among people whose ancestors conquered rugged terrain and seceded from <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> during the Civil War. `` <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> is a very patriotic state,'' Secretary of State <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Hechler </PERSON> said. `` We have a lot of hunters who are very good in the use of guns. A few of them join up because of the tough times at home.'' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> officials say the state has n't received a fair return on its investment. While the state's residents paid $ 1.59 billion in federal taxes that went toward defense spending in 1987, only $ 322 million in defense-related work was funneled back to the state, according to a study by <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>. `` <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> is first in war, first in peace and last in the hearts of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Hechler </PERSON> said. But <LOCATION> Barboursville </LOCATION> residents say they are n't bitter, and draw from a healthy reservoir of patriotism even when it is n't Veterans Day, which will be observed on Saturday. `` If we ever have a war on our shores, the enemy will be in trouble,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, a 41-year-old <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran and resident of the home. `` If they got as far as <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, they would n't get much farther.'' `` War was just something that had to be done. We had a man who told us what to do and we did it,'' said <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, a World War II veteran. `` I've never talked to a West Virginian who came back and said he was sorry he went.'' About 115 veterans live in the <LOCATION> Barboursville </LOCATION> home, a former state hospital that was renovated in 1975. The average stay is 16 months and residents double -, triple - or quadruple-up in cramped quarters formerly used by mental The library is stacked with American history books and newspapers and the place is festooned with enough red, white and blue to look like victory for an enterprising flagmaker. Thick clouds of cigarette smoke seem to hang everywhere. There's little anger toward those who fled to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to avoid the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> draft and those who protested the war. `` My choice was to enlist and go to war,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. `` Those who left for other countries, they have to live with themselves.'' But mention the flag _ and burning it _ and it sets off a torrent of comment about `` kids'' who do n't know enough to respect it and the ideals it stands for. `` When you are in the services, when you see the flag go up the pole you get a feeling in your body. Chills go up your spine. You still get that feeling,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Messenger </PERSON>, 58, a Korean War veteran who said he got tired of living alone and moved into the home a month ago. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Breeding </PERSON>, 56, said most people learn about war through pictures, movies and news accounts _ not by living through it. `` If he goes to a war zone and sees what we went through, he would n't go do that,'' Breeding said of the flag burners. `` I do n't believe in burning the flag, but I do n't believe in beating the stuff out of a man on the steps of the Capitol,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. `` I'd want to prevent a man from burning the flag and prevent a man from getting beat up for burning it.''

<HEAD>Democrats Consider Five Cities For '92 Convention</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Five cities are making their pitches to host the 1992 Democratic National Convention and party chairman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> says the decision will be based on facilities, not electoral politics. A selection committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was finishing a two-day meeting today to hear formal presentations from the five cities in the running. They are <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, with its suburb of <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The panel may pare the list to three or four and the members will visit those finalists. But <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he would regard the committee's final choice only as a recommendation and that he will make the final decision. `` I want a city that has facilities that will allow us to have a first-class convention, that will be able to nominate the next president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` It is principally what kind of facilities, what kind of financial package, the local support that we're going to have. `` There has been no decision made yet on where this convention is going to be,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> told the committee. `` It is truly an open process.'' <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> have withdrawn their bids. Several other major cities, including <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, declined to make a bid. Most cited the requirement that the party have unlimited access to the convention hall for three months before the convention as the reason for withdrawing or not bidding. The party also said each city would have to be prepared to invest $ 15 million. The Democrats met last year in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and the Republicans met in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> was the site of the 1980 GOP convention, and the Democrats met in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1976 and 1980. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> told reporters he did n't feel any need to look in one particular region as a symbolic selection and did n't believe selection of a city would make much difference in Democratic chances of carrying that state or region in 1992. `` It certainly has n't been the case in the past,'' he said. `` It is not going to be a principal consideration in these deliberations.''

<HEAD>House Overwhelmingly Passes Oil Spill Legislation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lawmakers expect President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to sign legislation on oil spill liability that they hail as `` an enormously significant environmental step forward'' from the days before the Exxon Valdez disaster. The bill approved 375-5 by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday gives `` the strongest possible incentives for those who transport and produce oil to take every precaution that is humanly possible to avoid a spill,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Studds </PERSON>, D-Mass. `` We have every reason to expect this bill to be signed,'' he said. Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, agreed the measure would be signed after it goes through conference committee to work out differences with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version. Young called it a `` pretty good bill,'' but said it would need `` fine-tuning'' to ease restrictions on the oil industry. During two days of debate, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> loaded its bill with amendments to strengthen its environmental language. The oil industry strongly fought the additions, arguing lawmakers were making oil hauling prohibitively expensive. Young led the effort Thursday to remove a provision added by Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., to make simple negligence, instead of gross negligence, the standard by which an oil company or carrier would have to pay unlimited damages under federal law `` With the defeat of the last <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> amendment, the president will sign the bill,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. He said the amendment was `` an attempt to embarrass the president'' because it would cause him to veto a bill seen as the chief congressional response to the Exxon Valdez spill. The tanker spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil into <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> in the March accident, devastating miles of scenic coastland `` This is an enormously significant environmental step forward,'' <PERSON> Studds </PERSON> said of the bill. `` It took, tragically, as in human nature is so often the case, a disaster of the dimensions of Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> to provide the public focus and spur the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ... to act far more quickly than they have in previous years,'' he said. The most significant vote on the legislation was the approval Wednesday of an amendment by <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Studds </PERSON> to allow states to set stricter liability laws than the federal government. That provision also is in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version. Twenty-eight states have their own oil spill liability statutes, and 19 of them require unlimited liability. A key provision approved Thursday would require all tankers that come into <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ports to have double bottoms within seven years and double hulls within 15 years of the bill's enactment. New tankers would have be built with double hulls and double bottoms and those already in use would have to be refitted. `` When I see people like the builder of the <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, the company that is repairing it, saying that there would have been environmental protection, a 50 percent reduction in the loss of oil if there had been a double bottom, I'm impressed,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Torricelli </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, who wrote the language on double bottoms. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> narrowly defeated a similar provision. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said he did n't think the <PERSON> Torricelli </PERSON> provision would survive House-Senate negotiations in its present form, although he thought the final version would call for some kind of improved technology on ships.

<TEXT>
 The nation's <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops ended their annual fall meeting by urging <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to negotiate terms of an independent Palestinian homeland, and rejecting condom education as means of preventing AIDS. Over the objections of some American Jewish leaders, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> Bishops unanimously approved Thursday a policy statement on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> that declares Palestinians have a right to `` participate as equals'' in negotiations affecting their destiny and the right to a homeland. `` The conclusion which follows from these assertions is as clear as it has been controversial: Palestinian representation in <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> negotiations leading to <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> territorial and political sovereignty,'' the bishops said. The policy statement on AIDS declared condom education represents a `` quick-fix'' approach to the AIDS crisis that promotes a false sense of security. `` You're dealing with a deadly, terminal illness. To suggest to anyone to use a device ... that may not work is a very dangerous admonition,'' said Archbishop <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON>, chairman of the committee that drafted the statement. Both the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and condom education stands drew criticism. Rabbi <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Banki </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said the bishops' call for Palestinian sovereignty `` removes incentives for flexibility and accommodation on the part of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leadership.'' And <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Blotcher </PERSON>, a spokesman for the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, said not giving youngsters information about condoms is `` abandoning them to death.'' The bishops' statement on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> affairs called on the administration to increase talks with Palestinians; support a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> homeland; press <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states to normalize relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>; and urge all foreign nations, including <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, to withdraw from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The bishops also called upon the Arab states and Palestinians to recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist, and said there must be negotiated limits on <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> sovereignty to protect <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security Cardinal <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Law </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> said the statement is a `` sorely needed invitation to dialogue for the cause of peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' The wide-ranging AIDS statement opposes universal mandatory AIDS testing, calls for increasing federal funds for AIDS research, and denounces violence and discrimination against those suffering from the fatal disease as immoral. `` The threat of AIDS is real and great. Precisely, though, because of their terror, people act without reason,'' said Archbishop <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, outgoing president of the bishops' conference. `` Persons with AIDS are often shunned: They lose their jobs, they ca n't rent homes, schools wo n't educate them, insurance companies wo n't cover them. `` As moral leaders, we say that sort of discrimination is a scandal and compassion is the only Gospel response.'' The statement drops an assertion in a 1987 document that the church could tolerate public school education on condoms as long as sexual abstinence was taught as the `` only morally correct and medically sure way'' to prevent AIDS. On condom education, the statement approved Thursday said: `` The ` safe-sex' approach to preventing HIV @ AIDS, though frequently advocated, compromises human sexuality and can lead to promiscuous sexual behavior.'' Archbishop <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, the newly elected conference president, said in an interview priests would still be able to counsel condom use in individual cases if it seemed the only recourse for an individual who would refuse to remain chaste.

 The nation's governors say they will seek help from members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and experts in the business and education fields in keeping their promise to set up national education goals by the end of February. Emerging from a White House meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials Thursday, governors said they will also hold a Dec. 7 <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Education meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and are seeking state hearings and discussions in December and January. `` We promised in <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION> to put this national education goals on the front burner for the governors, on the front burner for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and we're keeping it on a very very fast track,'' said <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, a Democrat. The drive for national goals came from the education summit President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the nation's governors held in late September at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> said the governors will seek the views of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and other educational experts before recommending targets for the nation's schools. `` Before the summit, we let the leadership of both parties of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> know that we needed their help and support and their involvement in order to do anything meaningful to restructure the schools and to get greater flexibility in the expending existing federal programs,'' said <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and educators were excluded from the two-day summit that concluded nationwide goals are needed to improve learning. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, a Republican, said governors want to `` form a true coalition between the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the states and the executive branch of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in trying to build a consensus to improve education in the country.'' <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and a Republican, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will be asked to begin immediately to work on legislation that would bring more flexibility to regulations attached to many federal education programs. Looser restrictions on federal funding was discussed at the summit. Other summit goals were to improve early childhood programs, restructure school systems to make educators more accountable, keep drugs out of schools, bolster on-the-job education, improve literacy and reduce the national dropout rate. <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> led the group of governors who met at the White House with chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>; <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, the president's domestic policy adviser; budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>; and Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> After the Dec. 7 <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> meeting of education experts, the governors will hold state hearings and discussions in their respective states in December and January, said <ORGANIZATION> NGA </ORGANIZATION> Vice Chairman <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. Once the goals are adopted, said <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>, governors will focus on strategies for reaching them and `` tackling the rest of the ambitious agenda we set at the summit.'' `` Goals are the essential first step toward what the governors are really after _ results in the classroom and in the workforce,'' said <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> wants to undertake a major survey of the AIDS risk among surgeons as part of its effort to determine the particular risks in health care professions. `` It's very delicate,'' said Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, explaining negotiations with members of the surgical profession. He said surgeons are concerned that patients, for example, could demand the results of AIDS tests for all patients. He said the method of conducting the test is in place if the agreement can be made. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> mentioned the proposed study Thursday when asked to comment on allegations made at a congressional hearing that government health officials are grossly understating the possible risk of contracting AIDS. Dr. <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, chief of orthopedic surgery at <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said the government fears health care workers will deny treatment to HIV-infected patients if all the risks are known. She told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on health and safety that <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> and others have been off the mark in their assessment of the AIDS risk. She said the same argument used now that AIDS is not transmitted by saliva was used in 1983 to rule out transmission of the virus by blood transfusions, and the number of documented cases in each instance was the same: five. `` There are more things we need to do,'' <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> acknowledged, but said there are `` huge masses of data indicating what the risks are.'' He said health care professional need to ensure that instruments and techniques are not `` inherently hazardous.'' Three surgeons in the last 10 years who engaged in none of the high-risk behavior associated with AIDS have contracted the disease, he said. `` We have the feeling that while its true that these are cases of AIDS and not HIV infection, we have the feeling that after 10 years we would see more than three surgeons. It's a feeling,'' he said. The subcommittee is conducting hearings on proposed federal regulations to limit the spread of blood-borne pathogens such as the AIDS and hepatitis B viruses. Day said the same reluctance to look at possible AIDS infection through contact with unbroken skin and saliva is cheating the public of important knowledge. The government says AIDS is spread through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products and from infected pregnant women to their offspring. Day said the growing risk of AIDS cases prompted her to resign effective Feb. 1, 1990, from the hospital. The hospital has <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s only trauma center and is one of the foremost AIDS research centers in the country. `` I personally know 13 surgeons who are HIV positive from occupational exposure,'' she said, adding patients have a right to know if their physicians are infected. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said as for possible transmission of AIDS through contact with unbroken skin, `` We just do n't see that.'' He said there is nothing to suggest that transmission through the high-speed tools used in an operating room is a risk. One study cited by Day showed that the AIDS virus lived seven days outside the body. But <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said that involved higher concentrations than in any operating room or the `` worst AIDS patient.''

 Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> quashed rumors that he might resign to spend more time with his wife, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>, as she prepared to leave the hospital where she has been recovering after drinking rubbing alcohol. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' family said she may leave the <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> today, four days after she drank the poisonous fluid <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> issued his first public statement about his wife Thursday after spending two days at her bedside. He vowed to stand by her and to serve out the remaining 14 months of his term. `` We have a tremendous amount of work to do here,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. He said he had faith in his wife's ability to rebound: `` I love <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>. I'm going to stand by her, just as she's always stood by me. We're in this thing together.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also alluded to the strain of the past year, beginning with his defeat to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the presidential race last Nov. 8. `` This has been a very difficult week for Kitty and for me and for our family. And it's been a difficult year,'' he said. `` Many families have troubles like this ... You do your very best to deal with it _ and then you go on.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was treated for alcoholism in February and previously has admitted to a long period of abusing diet pills. Some alcohol and drug abuse experts around the country said it was not uncommon for recovering alcoholics to reach for anything containing alcohol if they suddenly get a craving. One specialist said it did not sound like a suicidal gesture. `` Sometimes people will drink any alcohol when they're craving the drink,'' said <PERSON> Dominic </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciraulo </PERSON>, a senior consultant in substance abuse at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` Sometimes the craving for alcohol becomes so intense that they ignore the risks.'' <PERSON> Markku </PERSON> <PERSON> Linnoila </PERSON>, clinical director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcoholism </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, said he could not comment directly on the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> case but in such a situation `` it certainly looks like a fairly desperate individual doing something out of the ordinary.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was taken to the hospital by ambulance Monday night after experiencing `` severe reaction'' to drinking rubbing alcohol, said Dr. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> family physician. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was said to be suffering from depression and exhaustion stemming from a busy schedule of speaking engagements and work on her upcoming book.

<TEXT>
 The adoration for Philippine President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> is perhaps somewhat diminished from three years ago when she received the most thunderous reception <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ever gave a foreign leader. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s return visit this week is far more low-key than it was then, a time when she was still able to coast on her image as symbol of modest righteousness, triumphant over the corruption and extravagance of the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> era. It was a time when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lawmakers were so taken with <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s eloquence in an appearance before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that they quickly lavished $ 200 million in extra aid on the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, prompting <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> wags to call it the largest honorarium in American history The affection for Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> was _ and still is _ genuine but, as any diplomat knows, relations among sovereign states are based not on heartfelt sentimentality but compelling national interests. The issue now for Americans and Filipinos is not so much whether democracy can survive _ the communist insurgency seems less menacing than before _ but rather what kind of relationship the two countries should have. Can the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> survive the growing nationalism among Filipinos? Does the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> need all those military facilities now that so many people are saying the Cold War is over? Does a large <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid program enable the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> to defer badly needed but politically painful reforms? Should aid be replaced by trade or is a combination of both the best approach? Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> seems sensitive to the notion that there are limits to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid levels, and her visit here emphasizes trade and investment instead. The military base question was not even on her agenda with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> although she was meeting this afternoon with <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. It's hard to overestimate the difficulties she faces back home. She presides over a country where 40 percent live below the poverty line, where the per capita income of $ 700 a year is less than a quarter of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s and where servicing of the nation's $ 28 billion foreign debt is a continuing drain on cash assets, exceeding foreign aid from all sources combined. But it's the base issue that is expected to dominate U.S.-Filipino relations between now and September 1991 when the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leases on <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Air </PERSON> <PERSON> Base </PERSON> expire. Preliminary talks start next month. Discussions last year over base compensation for the Filipinos generated considerable acrimony, with the two sides arguing bitterly not only over aid levels but also over who gets the most benefit from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence, which includes 36,000 Americans and their dependents. The installations provide 68,000 jobs to the local economy but a significant minority of Filipinos look on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence as an infringement on national sovereignty. Sensing that the welcome mat may be withdrawn, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have begun speculating publicly about transferring the facilities elsewhere in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, mentioning such locations as <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Palau </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expressed confidence on Thursday that the two sides will reach an agreement that will prolong the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> did n't mention the subject in her arrival statement and brushed aside a reporter's question about it. Unlike three years ago, she's been playing hard to get. The base problem hangs over the relationship much like the gray cloud that sprinkled rain on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> Thursday morning as they stood on the White House south lawn. Still, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was able to put things in perspective. Recalling the halcyon days of 1986, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` From Main Street to Wall Street, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> loves the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. And <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> loves <PERSON> Cory </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>.''

<HEAD>White House Issues Last-Minute Invitation for Bush-Shamir Meeting</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be meeting with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> next week, after all. The invitation for next Wednesday's meeting was issued Thursday _ almost two months after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> first sought it while making arrangements for <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s visit to address Jewish groups in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> arrives in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Monday and his aides had been holding his schedule open in hopes that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would invite him to meet with him. Israeli officials were upset and mystified by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delay, believing that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had appeased <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> requirements by adopting Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'s proposal to begin making arrangements for Palestinian elections in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, speaking to reporters aboard a plane whic brought him Wednesday from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, said he had made clear to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> that he rejected the assurances it sought regarding the talks with a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation. `` It's all very curious. Did the Israelis misunderstand or is Baker trying to send some sort of signal?'' said one <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official. A White House statement on next Wednesday's meeting said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wanted to talk with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> about steps to advance the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> gave its qualified approval to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s blueprint on Sunday but asked for his assurances on several matters, including the exclusion of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> from any talks. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that another in a series of meetings between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> officials and <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representatives was held in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> on Tuesday to discuss the election proposal. It did not elaborate. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is still awaiting word from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, which has also been speaking for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, on whether the <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> plan has been accepted. The plan calls for elections to pick <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegates who would negotiate with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities for self-government in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. The crux of the problem concerns the makeup of the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation that will discuss the election procedures with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Thursday. To win the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s backing for the plan, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has proposed that some of the delegates be Palestinians living in exile. But <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, fearing that any exiled Palestinian would be a de facto <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> member, is insisting that only Palestinians from the territories be permitted to take part. Two weeks ago presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said a Bush-Shamir meeting was likely. But later in the day, his office issued a terse statement saying no decision had been made on such a meeting and that <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> would be here on a private visit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, asked at a news conference earlier this week whether he would meet with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, said he would be willing to consider such a meeting as long as the two sides have `` something positive to talk about.'' It would have been highly unusual for an American president to refuse to meet with an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leader. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is the largest recipient of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid, getting $ 3 billion each year, and is one of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s top allies.

<TEXT>
 It was, quite simply, the biggest party that fun-loving Berliners ever had. Hours after <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> opened the wall it built in 1961 to keep the two Berlins apart, thousands of East and West Berliners reunited in an outpouring of joy that lasted well into this morning. Hordes of East Berliners poured across the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, crossing in their tiny Trabant cars, on foot, or on packed subways. `` Madness! Madness!'' cried a 44-year-old <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> woman who gave her name as <PERSON> Inge </PERSON>. `` To think that I'm seeing all this after 28 years.'' She and her husband <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> were already in their nightclothes when they heard the border was open. `` We were up and dressed with our son in a second,'' her husband said. `` But even we could n't get across in the car, there were so many people. So we just left it there and pushed our way across.'' At the Invalidenstrasse crossing to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, police appealed frantically to the crowd to clear the path for hundreds of East Berliners crossing to raucous cheers from the Westerers. `` This is a historic day, and because it is such a historic moment we ask you to keep the crossing clear,'' a policeman repeatedly told the crowd. Few listened. `` We were here when the Wall went up in 1961,'' beamed <PERSON> West </PERSON> <PERSON> Berliner </PERSON> <PERSON> Helga </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuballa </PERSON>, 53. `` We're so happy. If it keeps on like this, we'll have nothing left to wish for.'' Champagne corks popped, and some <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> bars _ the only ones in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> which never close _ offered free beer to the arriving hordes of East Berliners. Other West Germans offered money to the newcomers. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> authorities ordered city subways to run all night to cope with the unprecedented mass of people moving around in the city. `` I promised him I'd take him across if they opened up the border,'' said <PERSON> Uwe </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheiderat </PERSON> as he and his 17-year-old son, <PERSON> Erich </PERSON>, gazed in wonder at the electronics on show in a display window on the Kurfuerstendamm, one of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s most elegant shopping streets. Hundreds of West Berliners took a journey themselves, heading in the opposite direction to catch a glimpse of the East. `` For the first time in my life, I had tears in my eyes when I listened to the TV news,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Huber </PERSON>, one of thousands of West Berliners who flooded toward the Invalidenstrasse crossing. `` What joy! This is the best thing that happened in 100 years!'' yelled another <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> man. `` It's crazy! It's crazy!'' shouted a young man from the back seat of a car. In the delirium, few seemed to notice that East German radio had announced visa-free entrances would stop this morning. In <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, however, hundreds of people jammed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> Alexanderplatz </ORGANIZATION>, already lining up for visas that would allow them to cross today.

 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> will begin intensive bargaining next week in an effort to resolve the 7-month-old strike against the coal company, the government's supermediator says. `` I'm absolutely convinced that both sides want a contract,'' mediator W.J. <PERSON> Usery </PERSON> said Thursday after he hosted the first face-to-face negotiating session involving <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Usery </PERSON> and other participants said the 75-minute session was largely spent setting ground rules for the negotiations but included a brief discussion of the broad issues in the strike, which has idled 1,700 miners in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> since April. `` We were n't dealing with substance,'' said <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON>. Among the rules, said <PERSON> Usery </PERSON>, was an agreement that specifics of the negotiations to begin Monday will not be disclosed to the media. `` We do n't want to mediate in the press,'' the former labor secretary and veteran mediator told reporters. <PERSON> Usery </PERSON> said negotiations would go on `` day and night if necessary'' and he held out hope the bitter and sometimes violent strike could be over by Thanksgiving. The biggest issue in the dispute is over <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s payments of health and retirement benefits, a fight whose outcome could have far-reaching effects in the coal industry. The company withdrew from a national compact among coal producers that guarantees retired miners health and pension benefits. The union believes that if <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> is successful in trimming those benefits, other companies will attempt to do so. <PERSON> Usery </PERSON> said he did not ask <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> and <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> to attend Monday's session and would not request their presence unless he believed an agreement was within reach <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> pledged his support for the mediation, saying he would do `` whatever I can do to help with the process.'' He also praised for <PERSON> Usery </PERSON>, saying he was `` very impressed'' with the man Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> tapped two weeks ago in hopes of resolving the strike. <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said, `` If anyone can get this job done I think <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Usery </PERSON> can.''

<TEXT>
 The flight of tens of thousands to the West and the stunning growth of a popular revolt has overwhelmed <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Communist leadership and forced reforms at a breathtaking pace. The tempo of change has been much faster in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> than in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Events have spun out of control since <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the Communist child of the Cold War, celebrated its 40th birthday just a month ago with 77-year-old leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> heading the celebration. But the party was spoiled by images of East Germans fleeing to the West, through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Now <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> _ builder of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> in 1961 _ is gone, along with most of his aging comrades. What was left of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> resigned en masse on Wednesday, and the new leader, <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>, tried to put together a leadership that could retain the political supremacy of a discredited party. He promised free elections, and then on Thursday Politburo member <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Schabowski </PERSON> announced the opening of his country's borders, unleasing the once unthinkable flight of thousands through crossings in the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall As <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> decreed reform in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, he also set loose reform movements across the Soviet bloc. At home, he allowed freer elections, a more open press and formation of legislative bodies that partly reflected popular will. In a decade of struggle, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> managed to come to terms with an opposition that rallied around Solidarity to form the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first non-Communist government <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> moved slowly but surely toward demoractic reform. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> seemed firmly embedded in the old ways, its leadership wary of change. Then, East Germans started leaving, in a swelling flood that has reached nearly 200,000 people. Even worse for the East German leadership, they were leaving through friendly countries _ <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> _ especially after <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> began dismantling fortifications along its border with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> May 2. No other East European state has undergone such staggering mass departures. The exodus caught the East German leadership by surprise. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, reportedly ailing and probably not in full control during those crucial summer weeks, then compounded the problem by mishandling the exit of East German refugees from the West German embassy in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. On the night of Oct. 3-4, thousands of East Germans stormed <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> station trying to get on the special trains taking the <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> refugees west on a bizarre journey back through their Communist homeland. Riot police beat back the crowds, and battled others on the streets of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> days later when they tried to march for reform during the 40th birthday celebrations. The next day, anger at the police and a mixture of shock and hopelessness caused 100,000 people to take over the streets of <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> to demand free elections. `` I'm leaving because of what I saw on the night of Oct. 3-4,'' said a <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> worker caught in the <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> station battle by chance. Another factor in the swiftness of the revolt in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was that the government did n't seem to know what to do. It could not stop the protests or the flight of East Germans, and could not prevent <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> from letting East Germans cross the borders. At the Czechoslovak-West German border this week, not every East German was fleeing. Some had simply driven friends to the threshold of freedom before returning home. `` Got to go back and keep on demonstrating,'' smiled a man in his early 40s from <LOCATION> Erfurt </LOCATION>, clenching a fist in the air.

<HEAD>Congress Sending New Military Aid to War-Torn El Salvador</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 With violence escalating in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, congressional negotiators on a $ 14.4 billion foreign aid bill are providing up to $ 85 million in military aid to the country's new rightist government. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conferees, who completed work on the measure late Thursday, also agreed to $ 12 million for police training to the government of President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>. But the police training aid was included only after lawmakers added a requirement that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the investigation into the deadly Oct. 31 bombing of the headquarters of a leading anti-government union. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, of the right-wing Arena party, took office in June. Talks he initiated with the leftist <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> guerillas fighting his government failed and violence on both sides of the 10-year-old civil war has escalated in recent weeks. Final agreement on the overall aid package by the conferees sent it back to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floors for final approval. The agreement also increased the likelihood legislation carrying substantial aid for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s new Solidarity-led government could be approved in time for next week's scheduled speech to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by party leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. The bill includes $ 533 million in aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, two Eastern European countries that have been on the leading edge of political and economic reform in the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. It also included $ 15 million in aid to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Population Fund, which would reverse a five-year policy of not funding agencies that carry on programs in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which has a policy that leads to forced abortions and sterilizations. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has vowed to veto the bill if it includes that provision, but it was considered likely to be removed when the measure goes back to the House. The bill also contained another veto target, a provision barring the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from using foreign aid money to entice any foreign government to carry out any policy that would violate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law. The provision grew out of the Iran-Contra affair, when <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> was rewarded with expedited aid for its support of the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. In other provisions, the bill: _ Extended authority of the <LOCATION> Export-Import </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> to subsidize sales of U.S.-made defense items to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> The provision, pushed by Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., was designed to facilitate a sale of Sikorsky helicopters to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> Overall Ex-Im funding was pegged at $ 615 million. _ Earmarked $ 35 million for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abroad </ORGANIZATION> program, the same as last year The program has come under fire as a `` foreign aid pork barrel'' that funds pet projects overseas of members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. _ Set aside $ 20 million in economic aid and $ 43 million in military aid for <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, which lobbies on Capitol Hill, but killed similar aid for <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ Provided $ 50 million as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contribution to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, but effectively froze the money until <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is satisfied that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commercial banks have made adequate concessions to write down third-world loans _ Redistributed the 23,000 metric ton sugar sales quota forfeited by <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions to <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nations and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> The measure included $ 4.7 billion overall in military aid and $ 3.2 billion in economic aid. The largest recipients of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> largesse are <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, which receive money as rewards for participating in the <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> David </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process.

 Yields on three-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> notes are at their lowest level since early 1988. The average yield in Thursday's auction was 7.77 percent, down from 7.93 percent at the last auction on Aug. 8. It was the lowest rate since three-year notes averaged 7.42 percent on Feb. 2, 1988. The notes will carry a coupon interest rate of 7 -RCB- percent with each $ 10,000 in face value selling for $ 9,994.70. A total of $ 10 billion in notes were sold out of bids totaling $ 27 billion. It was the second auction since the government debt limit was raised to $ 3.1 trillion Wednesday, narrowly averting the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> default in history. Thursday's auction originally was scheduled for Tuesday but was postponed then because the debt exceeded the ceiling.

<HEAD>Oscar Trophy Has No Copyright</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Oscar statuette, one of the most recognizable images in the entertainment world, has no copyright protection, a federal judge has ruled. The small Academy Award statue is part of the public domain, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> Laughlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Waters </PERSON> said in a ruling released Thursday. The decision was a setback for the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, which had sued a Chicago-based manufacturer of an employee-incentive trophy similar to the Oscar. Academy President <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Malden </PERSON> said the ruling `` comes as a shock to me.'' The academy said it would appeal. The academy claimed that the Star Award, the trophy look-alike made by Creative House Promotions, violated copyright laws, diluted the academy's trademark and represented unfair competition. The Star Award depicted a naked, muscular male much like the Oscar, just two inches shorter and holding a star instead of a sword. It had a gold finish similar to the Oscar, and stood on a circular gold cap mounted on a cylindrical base. Although Waters acknowledged that the <ORGANIZATION> Creative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> trophy is `` very similar'' to the Oscar, he rejected all of the academy's legal claims, saying that the statuette became part of the public domain prior to Jan. 1, 1978, the effective date of the Copyright Act of 1976 The film industry's top award was distributed from the first ceremony in 1929 until about 1941 without the `` c'' mark indicating a copyright. The judge ruled, too, that the Oscar not only was an honorary award but also was used to promote the film industry, and therefore did not have a `` limited purpose,'' as required by the copyright act. The academy noted that the ruling applied only to the statuette and that the academy's trademark and service marks for the Oscar and the Academy Award names and symbols are unaffected. `` We are surprised that the court would base its decision on events which occurred half a century ago, overlooking the meticulous fashion in which the Academy has protected the integrity of its institutional symbol for decades,'' <PERSON> Malden </PERSON> said in a statement.

 Lawmakers are complaining that the House-approved $ 305 billion defense bill is a weak response to major political changes worldwide and amounts to nothing more than a jobs program. `` The <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact is crumbling before our eyes and we're building weapons of destruction,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a longtime opponent of military Although both proponents and opponents criticized the defense bill _ a compromise package worked out by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conferees after nearly two months of contentious negotiations _ the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday adopted the legislation, 236-172. The bill, which goes to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, slashes $ 1.1 billion from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s request for the Strategic Defense Initiative but provides much of the money for two land-based nuclear missiles and the B-2 stealth bomber. The legislation also continues two programs <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sought to kill _ the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s F-14D Tomcat jet fighter and the <ORGANIZATION> AHIP </ORGANIZATION> helicopter _ for one more year, and postpones a decision on the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>' V-22 Osprey and the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> missile. The Osprey, the tilt-rotor aircraft that takes off like a helicopter but can fly like a plane, will receive about $ 255 million in research and development money in fiscal 1990 but no funds for procurement. The legislation includes money for 18 F-14D jet fighters but requires the manufacturer, <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, to sign a termination agreement ending all future production. Salvaging weapons programs _ and jobs in many districts _ drew the ire of a number of lawmakers. `` The defense pork bill passed the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> made no hard choices,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasich </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` The relationship between national security and the defense authorization bill is just about coincidental.'' The complaints came as <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> opened the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall and its other borders Thursday and allowed citizens to cross freely to the West for the first time in 28 years. `` Peace is breaking out and we're going to have four legs of the triad instead of three,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Colo </LOCATION>., a member of the Armed Services panel Another committee member, Rep. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, R-Ky., said, `` The winds of change are sweeping across every part of our world We have an opportunity to set a course to take this nation forward.'' Instead, <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was `` corrupted by parochial avarice.'' The defense budget, according to <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, `` continues to pursue the same tired old path of no change, military expansion, more and more brand-new conventional and nuclear weapons systems at a time when the world is crying out for change and the world is crying out for peace.'' Among the legislation's provisions are $ 4.3 billion for the B-2, $ 430 million less than the administration requested for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. The bill provides money for two bombers in fiscal 1990, one less than the administration sought. However, the legislation accepts <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal for components for five bombers in fiscal 1991. The bill provides $ 3.8 billion for SDI _ also known as <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> _ about $ 279 million less than was spent in fiscal 1989 and the first decrease since President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposed the anti-missile shield six years ago. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had sought $ 4.9 billion for the program. Approximately $ 1.1 billion is included for two land-based nuclear missiles: the multiple-warhead, rail-garrison MX and the single-warhead, truck-based Midgetman. The bill trims about $ 150 million from the administration's request for the two weapons and adds <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> language imposing a 50-missile cap on the MX. Also Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators reached agreement on a $ 288 billion military spending bill for fiscal 1990 that largely tracks the defense authorization bill on the major strategic weapons, said lawmakers and congressional sources, who requested anonymity.

<HEAD>Sharp Rise in Gonorrhea Could Signal Return to Unsafe Sex, Feds Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An outbreak of gonorrhea among homosexual men in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> could signal a `` risky relapse'' from AIDS-prompted `` safe sex'' practices among homosexual men, health officials warned. Researchers with the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that a study reported 79 gonorrhea cases in the first 10 months of this year at a public health clinic in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. If the rate continued, the clinic would report about 100 cases this year, compared with 27 last year. The surprising increase follows a 96 percent decline in gonorrhea cases at the clinic over the previous six years. Widespread publicity about the spread of the deadly disease among homosexuals has led to changes over the last decade in the sexual practices of many homosexual men who previously may have had many partners. Gonorrhea, like AIDS, is sexually transmitted. The latest increase might be an isolated occurrence among homosexuals who have continued to practice unsafe sex, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said in its weekly report. But the outbreak could mean that, eight years after the discovery of AIDS, `` some homosexually active men may have relaxed behaviors regarding sexual safety.'' `` These really profound changes _ celibacy, monogamy _ may be remarkably difficult, more difficult to maintain as time passes,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittington </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> specialist in sexually transmitted diseases. `` If this is indeed true, we in this business may need to look at things we can try to help people sustain these kinds of changes over time.'' The notion of a `` risky sexual relapse'' was put forth in June at an AIDS conference in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, as researchers said they had seen signs of riskier sexual behavior among homosexuals in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The new findings came from the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle-King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> STD </ORGANIZATION> clinic, where patients are classified on the basis of sexual orientation. The decade-long decline of gonorrhea in homosexual and bisexual men has been attributed to concern over the spread of AIDS, which was first reported in 1981. About 589,000 gonorrhea cases have been reported nationwide thus far this year, down from an average of 713,000 at this point in the five preceding years. AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, destroys the body's defenses against disease, exposing the victim to life-threatening infections and cancers. The virus that causes the incurable and fatal disease is believed to be passed mainly through sexual intercourse, shared hypodermic needles and from infected mothers to their infants before or during birth.

<HEAD>Dollar In Tight Range Against Yen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar remained in a tight range against the Japanese yen today while the key index on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> gained slightly. The dollar closed at 142.75 yen, up 0.05 yen from Thursday's close of 142.70 yen After opening at 142.98 yen, the currency ranged between 142.60 yen and 143.00 yen. A dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> said a rumor in the morning that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s central bank would raise its official discount rate caused dollar-selling pressure briefly, but the currency then recovered slightly before being sold by investment trust banks. Later, the rumor was found to be groundless. `` As a whole, the dollar remained directionless in a narrow range,'' said the dealer, who spoke anonymously. On the stock market, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, a 61.83-point gainer the previous day, added 5.78 points, or 0.016 percent, closing the week at 35,663.20. Volume on the first section was a heavy 1.1 billion shares, compared with 800 million shares traded Thursday. The market's main barometer slowed its advance as some participants took a cautious attitude because of uncertainties over Japanese and American monetary policies, securities dealers said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pilots accidentally dropped hundreds of bombs for years outside a military bombing range in central <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, and state officials are angry they never were told about it. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials, in a sweep that began Oct. 30 and should be completed by mid-November, have found some bombs on public lands used by hunters, hikers and off-road-vehicle enthusiasts. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has recovered up to 2,000 live and dead bombs dropped outside the 22,000-acre bombing range at <ORGANIZATION> Fallon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm just appalled this has occurred,'' Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said Thursday. He called it the latest in a `` string of broken promises from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` There is absolutely no reason why we can not expect them to stay within the boundaries that were given them,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> ordered the closure of state Route 839, an 18-mile road that parallels <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> bombing areas starting 60 miles east of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>. He also said the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> agreed to his request to close 35,000 acres of public land surrounding the ranges until the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> completes its cleanup. Citizen Alert called for an indefinite halt to bombing at <PERSON> Fallon </PERSON> pending an investigation into why the bombs were allowed to fall outside the 22,000-acre range for years without public knowlege. `` This is something they should have notified the public about a long time ago,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulkerson </PERSON>, executive director of the Reno-based environmental group. Capt. <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Rackowitz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fallon </PERSON>'s commanding officer, said the search and cleanup operation, code-named Operation Ugly Baby, is a routine exercise to ensure people's safety. The public was n't informed of the effort to keep away onlookers, he said Some of the ordnance is so dangerous is must be detonated on site. Some explosives were found a mile or so outside the military ranges and some appeared to have been there for up to 30 years, `` and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has done nothing in that time,'' the governor said. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> told military officials he was concerned some people might take live ammunition on public lands as souvenirs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sens. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, both D-Nev., have written <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> demanding full disclosure about where the bombs are and why they were allowed to sit for years Base spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinhardt </PERSON> said information about the search by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s Explosive Ordnance Disposal detachment was released after <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> television station <ORGANIZATION> KTVN </ORGANIZATION> reported the sweep. Fallon Mayor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Erickson </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> `` has always been a good neighbor'' and he's glad to see the recovery effort. `` Most of the bombs are in remote areas and I'm glad to see the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> identify a problem and take care of it,'' he said. <PERSON> Rackowitz </PERSON> said the current cleanup involves helicopters and ground crews patrolling areas just outside the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s Bravo 17 range. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> plans another routine search for loose ordnance next spring near the Bravo 16 and Bravo 19 ranges, he added. No accidents have been reported from people finding bombs. <PERSON> Rackowitz </PERSON> said the bombs were dropped outside the ranges because of system malfunctions or by training pilots who made mistakes.

<HEAD>Game Show Host Off Presidential Ballot in Brazil</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A popular TV game show host who appeared tied for the lead in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s presidential race lost his chance when an electoral court ruled he violated election guidelines and could not be on the ballot. The decision Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribunal </ORGANIZATION> ended the nine-day candidacy of <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, whose late entry into the race rocked <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s first free presidential vote since 1960. It came the same day a Gallup poll was published showing <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> virtually tied for the lead with center-rightist candidate <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>. The poll showed <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> had 21.6 percent of the vote. News reports speculated that President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> engineered <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>' entry into the race to undermine <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>, who has tried to distance himself from the highly unpopular government and create an image as a fighter of corruption. <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, who is not a candidate in the Wednesday's election, denied it. All seven members of the electoral court ruled <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> was ineligible to run because he violated a 1970 election law requiring each candidate to leave the directorship of a government-licensed business _ such as TV stations and networks _ three months before the election. <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>' lawyers contended he merely owned controlling stock in the <ORGANIZATION> SBT </ORGANIZATION> television network. But the court decided <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> actively ran the nation's second-largest network. The court also unanimously ruled <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>' tiny <ORGANIZATION> Municipalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> did not fulfill election registration guidelines requiring at least nine state conventions, and declared the tiny party defunct. <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> can appeal the decision to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, said the court president, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Rezek </PERSON>. <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, 58, refused comment on the ruling Thursday night. `` Mr. <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> told me to tell all of you reporters that he had a headache and went to bed,'' said his maid, <PERSON> Narilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopes </PERSON>. The TV entertainer, who is popular among <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s poor, had been widely criticized by other presidential candidates since he declared his candidacy. <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, born <PERSON> Senor </PERSON> <PERSON> Abravanel </PERSON> of Greek immigrant parents, rose from selling wallets on streetcorners 35 years ago to become a multimillionaire executive and owner of more than 30 businesses. Most candidates welcomed the court's decision. `` <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>' campaign was doomed from the start,'' said <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Inacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lula </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> of the Marxist-oriented Workers' Party. `` Now the campaign can get back to normal,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Covas </PERSON> of the left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Brazilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` Now all of those votes will come back to the true candidates of the campaign.'' <PERSON> Leonel </PERSON> <PERSON> Brizola </PERSON>, of the left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said those who backed <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> `` benefited from the dictatorship and do n't want to lose their accumulated privileges.'' He was referring to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s military rule that began in 1964 and lasted until <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, a poet, became president in 1985.

<HEAD>Army Grounds All Apache Choppers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> says it has grounded its fleet of AH-64 `` Apache'' attack helicopters after a flaw was found on two of the gunships during maintenance inspections. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement released at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> Thursday that it was grounding the 526 choppers as a precautionary measure because a cracked retention nut was found on the two helicopters. The grounding, the fourth of the Apache fleet, was expected to last a few days. The Apache is the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s newest and most sophisticated helicopter gunship. Army spokesman Maj. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bomier </PERSON> said no accidents had been reported because of the problem. The fleet, based throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, was grounded twice in 1986 and once earlier this year after an accident in which a piece of sheet metal struck a gunship's rotor blade. The grounding will remain in effect until an analysis of the part is completed at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>.

 A-7 Corsair attack jets like the one that exploded in air and crashed into an apartment complex Thursday night have been part of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arsenal since 1965. The subsonic, single-engine aircraft has been used for a variety of bombing missions on land and at sea, and was part of the American air armada in the Vietnam War. The single-seat A-7E, the version of the aircraft that went down in this north <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> suburb, has a 20mm gun and can carry up to 15,000 pounds of bombs and missiles. It was built by <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The first version of the Corsair, the A-7A, made its initial flight on Sept. 27, 1965, according to <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s All The World's Aircraft It has been extensively modernized over the years, particularly in the areas of flight control, navigation and targeting equipment. Corsair IIs were part of the two-carrier battle group that conducted a strike on Libyan terrorist-related targets in 1986. A-7Es and FA-18s used anti-radar missiles to neutralize air defenses. The airplane has also been used by the Greek and Portuguese air forces. Two years ago, a crippled A-7D Corsair slammed into the lobby of the <LOCATION> Ramada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inn-Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, killing 10 people. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> fighter was making an aborted emergency landing attempt on Oct. 20, 1987, when it crashed into the hotel 1 -LCB- miles from the runway moments after the pilot ejected. Maintenance records show that the A-7D had numerous oil system problems in the month before the 1987 crash. The plane had been brought in twice for dead-stick landings when its engine shut down in midair. Pilots who were interviewed after that crash said the plane is noted for its bombing accuracy, but also for unfortunate aerodynamics. `` It's not an easy plane to fly,'' one <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pilot said at the time. `` It's underpowered to begin with and if you lose the engine, there's not much glide left in the old bird. `` This is a seat bolted to a jet engine and without power, you've got the aerodynamics of a rock. We used to joke that if you got in trouble, you'd drop three feet for every foot you moved forward.'' <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> no longer produces the plane, but the company received a contract from the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 to rebuild two A-7s into `` A-7 Plus'' aircraft that would incorporate a stretched fuselage, a new engine that would give it supersonic capability and aerodynamic improvements. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> would ultimately like to rebuild many of its A-7s to the new Plus configuration, extending the planes' life into the next century.

 Seven of Hurricane Hugo's nine victims in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> died in the storm's aftermath, while 13 of <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s 29 victims in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> died at the peak of its impact, federal researchers found. But the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday residents of both places largely avoided the most common killer historically from hurricanes: the storm surge, a wall of water that builds up ahead of the storm's intense low pressure. The agency, reviewing reports by officials in 25 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> counties, said only one person died when <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s 17-foot storm surge swept the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> coast on Sept. 21-22 _ a 60-year-old woman in her mobile home. No storm-surge deaths were reported when <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> lashed <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> three days earlier. In <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, most of the Hugo-related deaths were electrocutions among repair workers after the storm. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, besides the woman killed in the storm surge, five people drowned while trying to bring boats inland at <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, four were crushed in mobile homes, two were killed by falling trees and one died in a house collapse. After the storm, nine people in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> were killed in five separate house fires blamed on the use of candles during power outages. Another four people were electrocuted during cleanup and repair work, two were killed by falling trees and one died in a chain saw accident. Because of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> deaths, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday recommended more efforts to educate the public in hurricane areas about the hazards of candles, the need to evacuate mobile homes and the hazards of boating during the approach of a hurricane.

 The heiress of a margarine fortune and her Colombian co-defendant were convicted of cocaine distribution and conspiracy and face a maximum sentence of life in prison.

 Club-wielding police today drove hundreds of protesters from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, where they were demanding the closing of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases. At least two people were injured. Protesters carried placards denouncing President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s meeting Thursday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` President <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a sign of her treacherous selling of her country's sovereignty in exchange for the bases,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, a union official who spoke at the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> rally. Police initially stood by as about 100 militant workers protested in front of the embassy to demand the six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases be closed. However, when about 500 marchers led by the League of Filipino Students arrived to join the protest, police arrested student leader <PERSON> Nathaniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Santiago </PERSON>. The students began hurling stones, and police fired warning shots in the air. They then charged the group, scattering protesters into sidestreets.

The delicate operation, involving federal agents, local police and even the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, unfolded in an unlikely setting: a quiet block in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> borough of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> that includes warehouses, tenements and humble houses with a view of the Empire State Building across the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. `` It's an old-fashioned neighborhood; most of the residents are hardworking, blue-collar or middle-class people,'' said resident <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Sullivan </PERSON> at a nearby coffee shop. `` Drugs are not within our vernacular.'' But in a raid on a three-story warehouse last Friday, drug agents found cocaine. On top of the cocaine packages in the sealed drums were six inches of a powdery substance, which police soon learned contained a 98 percent concentration of sodium hydroxide _ a chemical used in lye that can eat through concrete. In comparison, said Lt. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> of the Police Department's hazardous materials unit, drain cleaner has about a 4 percent concentration of sodium hydroxide, known as caustic soda. The authorities finished recovering the cocaine this morning, cataloguing 10,648 pounds of the drug, said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercier </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs special agent. Police and Customs officials estimate the cocaine's street value at $ 80,000 a pound. It could be the largest seizure to date in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and one of the five largest cocaine seizures in the nation's history, according to <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>. The investigation, begun by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION>, soon included federal drug agents, city police, county police and emergency medical squads. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> fed 80 workers on Wednesday night alone. Police working inside the warehouse wore oxygen masks, 40-pound tanks, and protective suits, the sleeves sealed with tape to two pairs of gloves. The gloves were changed when the chemicals ate through them, about twice an hour. The teams worked around-the-clock on the painstaking process of opening the drums, decontaminating, repackaging, removing the cocaine _ except on Sunday, when <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marathon </LOCATION> runners streamed right past the cordoned-off warehouse. As it was decontaminated, the cocaine was placed in a semi-trailer truck. Eventually, the truckload will be driven to an incinerator at an undisclosed location. <PERSON> Mercier </PERSON> said the cocaine could be tainted, despite the plastic that surrounded it in the drum. It was n't clear whether any had made it onto the streets. Sodium hydroxide can irritate the skin and respiratory tract and cause blindness. The damage is compounded when it's smoked or injected. Investigators were searching for five suspects, believed linked to the <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION> drug cartel. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported that police were searching for <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, head of a company called the <ORGANIZATION> Aranal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which rented the warehouse. In a simultaneous raid last Friday, agents found thousands of drums of sodium hydroxide in a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> warehouse leased by <ORGANIZATION> Aranal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mercier </PERSON> said he had no immediate word of cocaine in the drums there

 The dollar steadied in European trading today while traders debated the impact of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s decision to permit free travel for its citizens. Gold was slightly lower in quiet trading. The immediate impact of German developments, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, chief corporate dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suisse </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, was to create uncertainty about the consequences for the West German economy and thus undermine the Deutsche mark. `` Where there is uncertainty, there tends to be weakness,'' <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> said. Analysts said a flood of East Germans into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would have a mixed impact, raising unemployment but perhaps easing pressure on inflation as new arrivals accept lower wages. `` It may take months or years for problems to show through,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Furness </PERSON> of <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Samuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> `` What still is unclear is if any other of the major countries is going to do any better.''

 Masked gunmen raided an engineering college dormitory in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state before dawn today and fatally shot 19 students as they slept, police said. Eight others were wounded. Police said the gunmen were believed to be Sikh extremists fighting for an independent homeland in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, a rich farming state on the northern border with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The attack occurred just hours before Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was scheduled to arrive in the city for a brief campaign trip.

Sixteen students died instantly, said police, speaking on condition of anonymity. They said three of the 11 students injured died at a nearby hospital. The victims were students at two universities in neighboring states and were participating in <ORGANIZATION> Thapar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>'s annual youth festival, police said. Sikh extremists have killed at least 1,544 people this year in their bid for the separate homeland they want to call <LOCATION> Khalistan </LOCATION>, or `` Land of the Pure.''

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Actor <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridges </PERSON>, acquitted this week of attempted murder in the shooting of a drug dealer, left jail for the first time since February after a mistrial was declared on the lone assault charge facing him. Bridges, best known for his role in the former <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> series `` Diff ` rent Strokes,'' was released from jail on $ 25,000 bail Thursday after the jury could not reach a unanimous verdict on the charge of assault with a deadly Bridges, 24, was acquitted of attempted murder and attempted voluntary manslaughter Tuesday. He had been in custody since his arrest in early February, accused in the close-range shooting of <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> `` Tex'' <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>, a drug dealer's henchman working out of a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> house where crack cocaine was peddled. <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> survived the attack and testified that Bridges was highly intoxicated the night of the shooting. Bridges said in tearful testimony he had been on a four-day cocaine binge at the time and did not remember pulling the trigger. Superior Court Commissioner <PERSON> Florence-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> declared the mistrial after jurors announced they remained deadlocked 8-4 in favor of acquittal. Bridges `` was gratified, real pleased,'' defense attorney <PERSON> Johnnie </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said Thursday. `` He just wanted to get out. He wants to put his life back together.'' The prosecutor, Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodgman </PERSON>, said he was surprised and disappointed by the acquittals and mistrial. He said the district attorney's office likely will decide next week whether to retry Bridges on the assault charge. Juror <PERSON> Maxine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said `` it was a sloppy case'' and that Bridges `` never should have been charged with attempted murder. There was no problem finding him not guilty of attempted murder at all.'' The prosecution had argued that Bridges shot Clay eight times at close range in a dispute over the actor's <ORGANIZATION> BMW </ORGANIZATION> automobile. <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> denied he had stolen the car in his testimony during Bridges' preliminary hearing but reversed himself during the trial. <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> characterized Bridges as `` a babe in the woods'' out of his element in the mean streets of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, and said the actor had fired in self-defense.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has poured an additional $ 1.1 billion into money-losing state factories, it was reported today, a blow to the government's attempt to balance the budget. The latest loan to large industrial enterprises, reported by the official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> today, was also more bad news for citizens who are being forced to buy `` voluntary'' debt bonds to pay for government subsidy programs. The daily said the Industrial and <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION>, which recently gave out $ 1.4 billion in loans to faltering government enterprises, was providing the additional credit to carry them through current difficulties. It said $ 378 million more had been set aside as credit funds for enterprises having cash problems due to a government austerity policy that has restricted money supply. The daily said the latest funding was believed to be part of a more sizeable loan. If so, it would appear the government has begun to cave in on a tough fiscal policy out of fears of plant shutdowns, rising unemployment and recession. On Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> outlined a plan committing the nation to at least two more years of economic retrenchment and called for the gradual achievement of a balanced budget. Hard-line communists led by Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> face the dilemma of supporting an inefficient government-run system that makes fiscal solvency an impossibility. About a quarter of government industries, top-heavy with workers and shackled by planning demands, are money losers, and the central government is believed to pay out about $ 10.8 billion a year in subsidies to keep them going. The <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> has put <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s budget deficit at about $ 2.2 billion but Western economists say it could be as much as four times that amount if foreign loans and the issuance of treasury bonds were included.

 Hundreds of East Germans converged on Checkpoint <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> today to cross through the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall to the West for the first time in their lives. Tens of thousands more virtually stormed police stations across the country to get the visas that will take them West. But West German news media quoted some travelers as saying they found that formal visas were n't even necessary to join the wave of visitors to the West. `` Ca n't take it in,'' muttered <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Imhof </PERSON> as he stood in line at Checkpoint Charlie for a visa that would take him to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> through the weekend. Communist authorities on Thursday began allowing citizens to travel freely to the West for the first time since the wall was erected in 1961. `` I've worked right here next to the Wall for 20 years,'' <PERSON> Imhof </PERSON> said, jerking a thumb in the direction of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. `` You looked across once in a while. But the fact that we can go through, it's just unbelievable. On the Western side of the Wall, East German construction workers still wearing their work overalls and hard hats drank beer and toasted their first experience of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, watched by about 200 curious Westerners and immortalized by a host of photographers. Back in the East, more hard-hatted workers filled out the uncomplicated forms that guaranteed them a brief visit to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. `` Everybody wanted to go so we decided to do it in shifts,'' said a young worker who declined to give his name. `` But we're still fulfilling our quota of work,'' he assured a reporter The crowd waiting to go across included three Soviets, who said they missed the chance to go through Thursday when the news broke. `` But we must try now. Just to see it once,'' said a Russian worker who said he lived in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> but declined to give his name. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON>, a 20-year-old factory worker who declined to give his last name, was one of the uncounted tens of thousands who surged across to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> without waiting for the official visa on Thursday night. `` I think it's simply great,'' he said on <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Leipziger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strasse </ORGANIZATION> this morning just after getting the stamp that will allow him unlimited trips to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> for six months `` I was over there for an hour last night,'' he said. `` I did n't see much, it was dark But the way the people greeted us _ that was wonderful. And I saw enough to know that it's something quite different over there. It's a once-in-a-lifetime feeling.'' At one <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> police station, about 3,000 people were waiting for the new visas by the time the police station opened at 8 a.m., witnesses reported. Police stations were ordered to remain open through the weekend to cope with the crowds, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. At the Checkpoint <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON>, the famed spot where East and West have exchanged spies for nearly three decades, as well as the Invalidenstrasse and <ORGANIZATION> Bornholmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strasse </ORGANIZATION> crossings into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, people were being waved through after simply filling out a form for a one-day visit. Some did n't even have to do that. Neither <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> nor <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> authorities had any real idea of how many tens of thousands of East Berliners into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Thursday night and early today in a delirious, spontaneous outburst of joy. However, the Sender Freies <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> radio station estimated the number at more than 50,000.

 <LOCATION> POLAND </LOCATION>: The Communists began negotiating with the outlawed Solidarity trade union in February to halt labor unrest and enlist the opposition group's help in instituting austerity measures. On April 17, the Communist government grants Solidarity legal status and allows limited opposition participation in elections. Solidarity wins virtually every seat it is allowed to seek, then puts together a legislative majority with two minor parties that were once thought to be puppets of the ruling Communists. The Communists are unable to form a legislative majority or a government. On Aug. 18, Communist President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> approves the concept of a Solidarity-led government. A week later, <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, a former Solidarity activist, becomes the first non-Communist prime minister of a Soviet bloc nation.

After <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> made reference to his retirement, <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> said: `` You will never be without great influence.'' `` Are you opposed to it?'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> asked. `` I am for it,'' <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> commented that <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> is no longer secretary of state `` yet you are still busy working in international affairs.'' <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> is making what is believed to be his 15th trip to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since a secret visit in 1971 that set the stage for normalization of relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> referred to his advanced age and his stutter but said he was `` quite healthy,'' adding, `` My mind is quite clear.'' He was replaced on the military body by <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief. Former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> continued to be pilloried in the official press even while a just-concluded party meeting refrained from further attacks on the once-powerful reformer. This week's edition of the <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper-Magazine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Digest </ORGANIZATION>, a weekly review of the official press, accused <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> of `` violent treachery'' in the 1988 demise of the party ideological magazine `` Red Flag.'' <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, 70, was purged from all his party posts on June 24 at a party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting that accused him of supporting the pro-democracy demonstrations crushed by the military earlier that month. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, believed to be under house arrest, has been under constant attack since then and there has been speculation he might face criminal charges. However, the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, in a communique issued Thursday, failed to mention the former party chief, indicating either that the <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> case has been put to rest or party leaders were unable to agree on how to deal with him. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> said in an interview with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jiji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> today that an investigation into <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s actions has not been completed and as a result his case had not been taken up at the party meeting.

 A disgruntled House Republican from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> is going to get a seat on the <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> after saying he could `` just as easily be a Democrat.'' Rep. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> insisted he had not actually threatened to bolt his party. But <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders got him on the panel anyway. House Republican leaders <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, after consulting with <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, hurriedly arranged <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON>'s appointment Thursday. The behind-the-scenes jockeying took place after the State newspaper in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, quoted unidentified sources as saying <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON> felt out of step with his party and was considering crossing over to the Democrats. But what had been irking <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON> was his inability to get on the committee he called `` extremely important to the health and wealth of the 1st Congressional District'' of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> is a native of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and congressional sources said <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON>'s defection could have proved embarrassing to him. <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> said the party chairman discussed the problem at breakfast Thursday with <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, who has known <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON> since he was a volunteer for <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON>'s mayoral candidacy in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> in 1970, said he spoke with <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> about the seat for <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON>. `` It was those two who lobbied and got the votes on the committee,'' said <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, adding `` it makes sense'' to have a congressman from the coastal city of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> on the committee. Earlier Thursday, <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON> had dismissed speculation in his home state that he was prepared to leave the GOP. `` If I was going to switch parties, I would hold a press conference and I would tell the people at home I was switching parties and why,'' the lawmaker said. `` I would n't make a switch unless I had a compelling reason.'' In an interview earlier this week, <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON> said he had been criticized by conservatives in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> for his recent support of funding for abortion in cases of incest or rape and for backing some spending measures. `` I'm just not a right-winger. I'm a moderate, and it just drives some of the Republicans back home up the wall,'' <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` I could just as easily be a Democrat as a Republican.'' But <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON> said Thursday those comments were nothing new and `` that's a lot of old stuff I've been saying for a long time.'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> had to lobby Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, the senior Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, to remove his objections to <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON>'s joining the panel. <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON> had said <PERSON> Young </PERSON> was blocking his appointment because he opposed <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s stance in favor of opening the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> to oil exploration. <PERSON> C.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Zane </PERSON>, <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s administrative assistant, confirmed that <PERSON> Young </PERSON> fought <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON>'s appointment because <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON> refused to pledge to support <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s position on the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> issue. <PERSON> Zane </PERSON> said <PERSON> Young </PERSON> `` went along'' with the requests of the party leadership to seat <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON> out of concern for party unity. `` There was a big push from <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> and other Republicans, including <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, because they did n't want to deal with losing a guy to another party at this time,'' the aide said.

<HEAD>`Prince of Central Park,' A New Musical, Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 4 grafs with other critics' comments. No PMs planned.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Only in a Broadway musical can you spend the night in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Central Park and survive to sing and dance. Not only sing and dance, but build a home, in this case a tree house complete with dinnerware stolen from Tavern on the Green. `` Prince of Central Park'' is a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> fairy tale told with a modest amount of musical imagination and wit. The show, which opened Thursday at Broadway's Belasco Theater, is a small musical in almost every respect. It's not awful, but its mildness and meager musical numbers make it a dim prospect to last very long on Broadway. The story, adapted by <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>, is based on <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>' successful novel and a well-received television special A middle-aged woman facing divorce meets a young runaway in Central Park. She's escaping from an unsatisfying marriage; he's fleeing a brutal life as a foster child. Before the musical is over, they unsurprisingly have forged a new family. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> conjured up by <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>, composer <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebesky </PERSON> and lyricist <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Nissenson </PERSON> is a remarkably tame city, despite the references to drugs and crime. At times, their vision of <LOCATION> Gotham </LOCATION> seems like bargain basement <PERSON> Comden </PERSON> and <PERSON> Green </PERSON>. It's a city where police officers tap dance, bag ladies are lovable, sales clerks ask if they can help you and muggers look like refugees from an <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION> video. What makes the musical tolerable is the personalities of its two stars, <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Worley </PERSON>, who plays the woman, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> as the boy. <PERSON> Worley </PERSON> is what used to be known as `` a trouper,'' a vanishing breed on Broadway today. No matter how unhummable the music or insipid the lyrics or book, she carries on. <PERSON> Worley </PERSON> charges through the show as if she believes every note and word. She is having fun and insists the audience do so, too. <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> has remarkable poise for a 14-year-old. He can dance as well as sing, talents which director and choreographer <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> utilizes to great effect. He has a rapport with <PERSON> Worley </PERSON> that adds a dimension not found in <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>' adaptation of the story. But <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Galde </PERSON> is an unmenacing teen-age villain, the kind of street punk who would have been out-of-date in the original production of `` West Side Story.'' There are too many dance numbers featuring <PERSON> Galde </PERSON> and his unthreatening gang of toughs from central casting. And <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Callen </PERSON> is left with the thankless task of playing <PERSON> Worley </PERSON>'s daughter who is conspiring to send her mother off to a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> retirement community. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bottari </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Case </PERSON> designed the revolving set, including a large tree that spins to reveal the boy's leafy sanctuary. When <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> sits there and stakes his claim to being `` The Prince of Central Park,'' the musical has a certain appeal. But too often the show depends on the charms of its stars to do the work neglected by the book, music and lyrics.

 What other critics said: <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>, The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>: `` Prince of Central Park'' ... is a numbing evening of such guileless amateurism that it will probably have a future as a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> case study, whatever its fate in the annals of drama. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissel </PERSON>, Daily News: None of this is presented with the slightest whimsy or genuine understanding. It all passes quickly by in sitcom-length scenes, punctuated by music and lyrics of equal dreariness and witlessness. <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>: In my subjective view this show, which started in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, should have stayed in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> _ the alligators might have found it more to their taste.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A boy born two months premature after his mother was fatally shot by a robber has died at the age of 2 weeks, officials said. `` It's a tragedy for a mother and a baby and it's a tragedy for all the families of innocent victims who have suffered violence in our society,'' Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said after <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>'s death Thursday afternoon at <LOCATION> Brigham </LOCATION> and Women's Hospital Dr. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Ringer </PERSON>, head of the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit, said the infant died of respiratory failure from his premature and traumatic birth. The baby had been in intensive care since his delivery by emergency Caesarean section shortly after his mother, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>, was shot Oct. 23. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>, 29, who was critically wounded in the attack, was brought by ambulance from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> to be at his son's bedside along with family members. Mrs. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>, 30, who was seven months pregnant, was shot and killed by a gunman who held up the couple in their car after they left <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> and Women's Hospital. `` Everybody in the city of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> was really praying beyond hope that <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> would make it,'' <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said. But family members said the baby, who was delivered two months prematurely, may have suffered serious brain damage. He weighed 3 pounds, 13 ounces at birth and had neither grown nor gained weight. The infant had been on a life-support system and suffered repeated convulsions since birth, family members said. The assailant in the case is still at large.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three whites who proudly admitted to being guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> were sentenced on terrorism charges today to prison terms of up to 25 years. Supporters in the courtroom threw yellow daisies at the defendants when the sentence was announced. One defendant, <PERSON> Iain </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, yelled, `` Long Live The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>!'' as police pulled him away. The two men and one woman acknowledged they were from the military wing of the predominantly black movement, which has waged a bombing and sabotage campaign since 1961 to end white rule and apartheid. They were arrested in May 1988 at a farmhouse outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> where police seized a large cache of Soviet-made weapons. It included a SAM-7 missile, hand grenades, mortar bombs, assault rifles and pistols, and was described as one of the largest caches ever seized in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Damian </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>, 31, a former journalist and leader of the cell, was sentenced today to 25 years in prison. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, 35, received a 20-year sentence and <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Westcott </PERSON>, 25, a native of <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION> whose parents are British, was sentenced to 18 years. Magistrate W.J. <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> den </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergh </PERSON>, in issuing the sentences, said the defendants `` were indifferent to loss of life. `` They are entitled to their own political views and beliefs. It is their transgressions of the law that must be punished,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, an independent anti-apartheid monitoring group, condemned the sentences as harsh and said apartheid was to blame for the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to use violence. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Soggott </PERSON>, the defense attorney, said an appeal might be filed. Ms. <PERSON> Westcott </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Westcott </PERSON>, said afterwards: `` We stand by our daughter _ she's done a very brave thing for this country.'' The chief prosecutor, <PERSON> Frans </PERSON> <PERSON> Roets </PERSON>, had asked for sentences of 125 years for <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>, 110 years for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and 90 years for Ms. <PERSON> Westcott </PERSON>. `` They wanted to intimidate the population with cowardly attacks,'' <PERSON> Roets </PERSON> said in his summary earlier this week in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> Regional Court. Prosecutors said <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> detonated a bomb last year that damaged a bus carrying military personnel to work. No one on the bus was seriously hurt. The three were held in solitary confinement for seven months after their arrest. They first appeared in court in January, and all three pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in June. Throughout the sentencing procedures, the courtroom gallery was packed with <ORGANIZATION> Arican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> supporters. Many wore the gold, green and black colors of the guerrilla movement. One session was attended by <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> and three other <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leaders who were freed on Oct. 15 after 26 years in prison.

<HEAD>Sailors Tell of Looting Aboard USS Iowa</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Adds last two grafs on Oakar.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sailors on the USS Iowa were looting possessions while their crewmen battled the explosion in a gun turret that killed 47 shipmates April 19, a published report says. As many as 10 sailors were involved in looting that day, although their names were withheld from their shipmates for fear of reprisals, crew members told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in a story published in today's editions. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has denied that any looting took place while crew members were fighting the fire in gun turret No. 2. `` It is absolutely false,'' said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` There was nobody caught. There was no break-in. There was no evidence of looting.'' <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> said the lockers of the 47 victims were sealed that day and no possessions were taken. However, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported it received a letter from an officer currently assigned to the USS Iowa who was on the battleship the day of the blast. `` You are correct that there was looting while the damage control efforts were ongoing on 19 April ...'' the officer, who was not identified, wrote The Times. `` Those who did the looting were punished either at captain's mast or at special court martial,'' the sailor added Two other sailors also have told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> they heard while on board the ship that looting occurred, although they had not actually witnessed the thefts. `` The bad part is they -LRB- the looters -RRB- tried to break into lockers of those that were killed,'' said former gunner's mate <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, who said he was informed of the looting by a master at arms. Two other former shipmates, who asked not to be identified, confirmed <PERSON> James </PERSON>' account. The <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in its report on the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> disaster described a locker break-in in the berthing area that housed those killed in Turret 2. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigation concluded that gunner's mate <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> `` most likely'' caused the April 19 explosion by inserting some type of detonator between bags of gunpowder in one of the ship's 16-inch guns. Rep. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said Thursday she is asking <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> to explain why <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Capt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> is being made eligible for another major command. `` I realize that consideration and possible selection of Capt. <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> does not commit the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to consider him for sequential major command, but I question the propriety of such action while there are several congressional and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigations ongoing,'' Oakar said.

<TEXT>
 Abortion rights activists plan to stage nearly 1,000 pro-choice events this weekend _ from a sunrise rally in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> to a sunset gathering in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> _ to remind lawmakers that limiting abortion access could be politically harmful. `` Since the emphasis in reproductive choice has shifted from the federal level to the state legislative level, we feel it's important to have demonstrations in each state,'' said <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, which is planning a demonstration at an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> park Organizers of the campaign, called Mobilize for Women's Lives, said the demonstrations, panel discussions and other activities in towns and on college campuses are to remind legislators they represent the views of the majority of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> public. Abortion opponents said they would stage counterdemonstrations at some locations. Representatives of both sides said they plan to turn out for two-block march on the state capitol in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, Miss. `` People for choice have been invisible because of legalized abortion,'' said <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>, president of Sister Spirit, a women's resource center in <LOCATION> Gulfport </LOCATION>, Miss. `` We have n't been threatened until now. Now we need to stand up and say ` We already fought this battle once, and we wo n't give up.''' <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> was referring to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision on July 3 that stopped short of reversing the <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision that legalized most abortions in 1973 but gave states more power to limit abortions. Sunday's events will begin with a sunrise rally in <LOCATION> Kennebunk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, and wind up with a sunset rally in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a rally is planned at the Lincoln Memorial in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

Asked if the purpose of the conference was to share in the news coverage, he said, `` I would n't deny that at all. It's a convenience for the media people, too, for us to all be in one place.'' It was a case from <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> that led to the recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> McCanse, an organizer of the pro-choice demostration in the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION>, said the expected turnout of thousands `` will be significant, because a lot of people in this country have written off <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> as being totally anti-choice. We want to demonstrate that is absolutely wrong.''

<HEAD>Moslems Protest, Hindus Rejoice over Disputed Shrine Site</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FAIZABAD, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities arrested about 1,000 Moslems today when they tried to march to the nearby town of <LOCATION> Ayodhya </LOCATION>, where triumphal Hindus celebrated the building of a new temple on a site claimed by both religions. The Moslem protest was peaceful, but one of its leaders who was arrested, <PERSON> Zafaryab </PERSON> <PERSON> Jilani </PERSON>, warned: `` When all these methods fail, arms are taken up. The next generation may not listen to peaceful protest.'' At least 290 people have been killed in Hindu-Moslem violence in three Indian states since August, when plans for the new temple were announced. So far the violence has not spread to <LOCATION> Ayodhya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Faizabad </LOCATION>, 330 miles southeast of the capital <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. The demonstrators in <LOCATION> Faizabad </LOCATION> accused Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of caving in to Hindu fundamentalists in a bid for votes from the Hindu majority in national elections less than two weeks away. `` If this ruling <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is ousted from power, perhaps secular government can be saved,'' said <PERSON> Jilani </PERSON>, a senior leader of the <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Babri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Masjid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Babri Masjid, or the Mosque of <PERSON> Babar </PERSON>, was built in the 17th century in <LOCATION> Ayodhya </LOCATION> on the spot where Hindu fundamentalists claim one of their most popular gods, Lord Ram, was born. About 90 minutes after the Moslems were arrested in <LOCATION> Faizabad </LOCATION>, a frenzied mob of Hindu worshipers celebrated the placing of the foundation stone of a new temple to Ram about 120 feet from the Babri Masjid. They flung marigold petals into a 6-foot hole where their leaders reverently placed a pile of bricks and a cornerstone. Police wearing helmets and chest protectors struggled to keep from falling into the pit as at least 5,000 pilgrims pushed into the small hilltop enclave in less than an hour. The Hindu-Moslem dispute over the <LOCATION> Ayodhya </LOCATION> hilltop is centuries old, but the the current furor centers on who owns the land where the foundation is being laid for a new Hindu temple. Hindus and Moslems had agreed that one tiny plot that was to hold the foundation stone was owned by a Hindu. The rest of the land needed to complete the new Ram temple is disputed. While the Moslems opposed the construction of the new temple, they agreed they could not prevent its foundation stone from being placed on the little plot owned by a Hindu. So far the courts in <LOCATION> Uttar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> state, where the government is headed by <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, have declined to rule who actually owns the property. The demonstrators in <LOCATION> Faizabad </LOCATION> vowed today to turn the Moslem votes away from <LOCATION> Gandhi </LOCATION> in national elections scheduled Nov. 22, 24 and 26. `` After today, Moslems will not vote for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Azam </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Uttar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> state legislator from the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Hindus make up about 83 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 880 million people. While Moslems make up 11 percent of the population, they have voted heavily for the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> since <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> became independent from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1947. With <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> facing a tough challenge this month from Vishwanath <PERSON> Pratap </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> coalition </ORGANIZATION>, the Moslem vote could be pivotal.

 West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> today interrupted his visit to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and flew to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s historic decision to open its borders to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> has said he would like to meet with new East German leader chief <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>, but there was no official word on whether such a session would take place. The state <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported in a brief dispatch that <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> in the early afternoon. Other top West German officials planned to join <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> for a ceremony in front the <LOCATION> Schoeneberg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, the spot where President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> made his famous `` Ich bin ein Berliner'' speech in 1963. <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s spokesman, told reporters the chancellor would return to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> on Saturday to conclude his visit. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> announced suddenly Thursday it was opening its borders and allowing its citizens to leave. Thousands of East Germans immediately swarmed into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> through the open <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall and at other crossings. Earlier Thursday, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> `` could be ready to offer significant economic aid if the will to reform manifested itself in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.'' In addition to opening his country's borders, <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> said the country would hold democratic elections, but it was not clear if the elections would include parties competing with the ruling Communists. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> also said he had discussed with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials the possibility of housing mounting numbers of East German refugees in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. His six-day visit here was intended to move the World War II enemies closer to reconciliation. The developments in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, however, drew attention away from the economic issues expected to be the focus of the summit. The developments have fueled Polish fears about German reunification and have forced long-simmering border issues to the forefront of <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s visit. `` Creation of a superpower in the heart of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is not a neutral concern for the future of a whole <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' said Polish deputy goverment spokesman <PERSON> Henryk </PERSON> <PERSON> Wozniakowski </PERSON>. `` Certainly <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is now looking more seriously on the possibility'' of German reunification, he said. <PERSON> Wozniakowski </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> recognizes the sovereign rights of both German states, `` but the question of reunification is not just a German question. It is also a European question,'' he said. Combined with Polish fears of a new economic superpower were worries over recent comments by West German conservatives that reunification should be sought within the 1937 borders of the German <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>. Those borders include large areas of what is now <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. A 1970 treaty between <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> recognizes the <PERSON> Oder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Neisse </PERSON> rivers as the western boundary of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, but a reunified <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would not be bound to those terms. <PERSON> Malgorzata </PERSON> <PERSON> Niezabitowska </PERSON>, spokeswoman for Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Masowiecki </PERSON>, said the prime minister `` stressed that Polish people must have certainty that the question of borders be settled permanently.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> also met with Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, the driving force behind the trade union movement's rise to control of the government. The West German leader came to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> with a billion-dollar economic package that is crucial for the new government to make the difficult transition toward a market-oriented economy. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s government has asked for huge amounts of Western economic aid, saying it is needed to safeguard the transition to democracy.

<HEAD>Architectural Preservationists Fear Needless Demolitions After Quake</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Many of the beloved Victorian buildings that give the city its charm are in jeopardy, say preservationists battling to have the quake-damaged structures repaired instead of razed. Hundreds of the beauties that survived the 1906 quake may not make it through 1989, the preservationists charged Thursday, saying city regulations aimed at getting unsafe buildings torn down may force property owners to take `` precipitous action.'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryser </PERSON>, executive director of the Foundation for <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Architectural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION>, criticized the city's procedure for inspecting damaged buildings. He spoke at a news conference in front of Saint <PERSON> Dominic </PERSON>'s Church, where workers were removing a tower damaged in the Oct. 17 quake, He said owners are not being given time to consider rehabilitation in lieu of demolition, and said structural engineers doing voluntary inspections for the city may lack the expertise to adequately assess building hazards. City officials defended the inspection and notification process. `` We have n't torn down that many buildings, only those that pose an imminent life hazard or are a danger to adjacent property,'' said Public Works Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. `` I'm tired of people taking potshots at the process, because it's a good process.'' Although some buildings were razed immediately after the quake, Deputy Mayor of Housing <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said recent efforts have focused on rehabilitation. More than 1,400 housing units are in buildings that have been `` red-tagged'' by the city, requiring owners to promptly shore up or demolish the buildings, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said. An additional 3,647 units are in buildings with limited access, he said, adding that total replacement costs are estimated at close to $ 200 million. <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> estimated that up to 500 historic buildings may be threatened in the seven-county area hit by the quake, which measured 7.1 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. Fewer than 200 buildings in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> are designated landmarks, but about 2,000 more are in designated historic districts, said <PERSON> Ryser </PERSON>. To help increase options for property owners, the Trust has established a special low-interest loan program for owners of quake-damaged historic buildings. The funds would be available to stabilize buildings while rehabilitation assessments are made, she said. Emergency legislation to prevent the demolition of any buildings not in imminent danger of collapse was signed by Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> on Monday. `` Natural disasters can not serve as a pretext for rash decisions to destroy important relics of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> history,'' said State Sen. <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Marks </PERSON>, who sponsored the legislation. Preservationists are worried about residential neighborhood buildings as well as public buildings. As an example, <PERSON> Ryser </PERSON> cited a 1908 building on Front Street that he said was needlessly razed. Although the front of the building was a public hazard and had to be removed, the entire structure did not have to be demolished, he said. Unnecessary demolitions may occur because owners are not aware of rehabilitation options, can not get qualified engineers to inspect the property within city-ordered time limits, or believe demolition is mandatory, <PERSON> Ryser </PERSON> said. He conceded that some owners may be looking for a `` convenient rationale'' to tear down unwanted property. A new city ordinance allows tenants who fear that landlords are unfairly trying to remove rental units from the market to call in an independent structural engineer to assess quake damage, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Moslem Fundamentalists Gain Largest Bloc In Jordan's Parliament</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN MARRIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Moslem fundamentalists, many of them campaigning under the slogan `` Islam is the solution,'' won the biggest bloc of seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> during this kingdom's first general election in 22 years. The result was an apparent setback for King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, who urged voters not to mix religion with politics in Wednesday's vote. Fundamentalist candidates captured 34 of the 80 seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, according to results announced Thursday. About 20 seats were won by pro-government candidates, while leftists, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> nationalists, tribal leaders and others took the rest. The breakdown gave opposition forces a clear majority over strict loyalists. For the first time, women were allowed to vote and seek office, but none of the 12 females among the 647 candidates won a seat. `` The people want Islam, and it is not strange for our country and our people to have such a large number of Moslem candidates winning,'' said <PERSON> Ziad </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghanimeh </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Moslem Brotherhood, the largest Islamic organization. The Brotherhood called for more social welfare programs to help the poor and for a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state on <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> territory. Its 26 declared and several undeclared candidates held the largest rallies in the campaign, including one in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> attended by about 5,000 people. Though the fundamentalists have often allied themselves with <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, they have also prodded him to embrace a stricter version of Islam with restrictions on Western-type entertainment, more social welfare programs and greater separation of the sexes. The new Parliament seems certain to be more assertive than the legislature dissolved last year, although <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> retains ultimate power. Parliament must approve all laws and can dissolve Cabinets. But the king can dissolve <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and rule without it, and he has done so for much of the past 15 years. The winners included <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON> <PERSON> Murad </PERSON>, who was convicted of participating in a 1969 attack on an <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> office of the Israeli state airline El-Al. The attack killed a Greek child and wounded 11 people. He was freed in 1970 in an exchange for 55 hostages aboard a hijacked Olympic Airways jetliner. During the campaign, many candidates who went on to win seats demanded prosecution of former officials accused of corruption and economic mismanagement. The nation has a foreign debt of $ 8.3 million, and financial hardship led to four days of rioting in April. The election formalized <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s separation from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, which held half the seats in the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> that was elected two months before <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the territory in 1967. Last year, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> renounced <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s claims to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> in favor the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and dissolved <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>.

 World leaders today praised <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s opening of its borders, with some predicting the eventual dismantling of the `` hideous construction'' _ the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall _ and the reunification of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> offered their military camps in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to handle the expected flood of emigres. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, which had become the gathering point for East Germans fleeing West, breathed a sigh of relief. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s prime minister, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, called it `` a great day for freedom'' and said Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the architect of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc reforms, had made it possible. <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON>, a former West German chancellor and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> mayor when the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall went up in 1961, said he believed prospects for <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> unity had taken a major step forward. `` The Berlin Wall will come down, and <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> will live,'' <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` It seems appropriate that this hideous construction, which never should have been built, has now definitely lost it reason for being,'' said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Uffe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellemann-Jensen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>. `` It was n't just the landscape of European politics which suddenly changed last night. It was the <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> cosmos,'' wrote political columnist <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Ascherson </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper The Independent. `` For most West Europeans now alive, the world has always ended at the East German border and the -LRB- <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> -RRB- Wall: beyond lay darkness and demons. The opening of the frontiers declares that the world has no edge any more. <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is becoming once more round and whole,'' he wrote. Austrian Chancellor <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> said the move was `` one of the most memorable events in the political history of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> said it was `` one of the most powerful statements'' about the strength of democracy. Not everyone was so impressed. Finnish Prime Minister <PERSON> Harri </PERSON> <PERSON> Holkeri </PERSON> told Finnish radio, `` As far as I can see, the final outcome of World War II still stands and the situation will not change because of these developments.'' The superpowers were relatively subdued. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said if <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> makes good on its promise to allow free emigration, `` This wall built in'61 will have very little relevance.'' Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> praised East German reforms but said any speculation about a reunified <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is `` out of the question.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> <PERSON> IV </PERSON>, agreed. He also told reporters in <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> that the changes under way in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> increase the risk of instability. Czechoslovak <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Lubomir </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsik </PERSON> said the opening of the East German border `` represents a positive solution.'' `` The situation was getting difficult for everybody, including <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>,'' he said, referring to the thousands of East Germans who previously were forced to go West via a third country, often <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. In an interview on French radio, <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> said the reforms will probably change `` the global balance.'' He tied them to rapid changes also sweeping <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` We have the duty first of all to assume responsibilities in aiding these countries,'' he said. The Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> headlined its report: `` The Iron Curtain Torn Open.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said: `` We all hope this is only the prelude to the dismantling of the Berlin Wall'' but added that the priority must be to see a `` genuinely democratic'' government in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. She, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> Defense Minister <PERSON> Jean-Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Chevenement </PERSON> offered the use of their countries' military camps in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to temporarily house any flood of emigres. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON>, said the opening of the border was a `` step full of hope'' that will likely lead to further reforms. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Taizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> told foreign journalists today: `` The <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall has in substance been lifted, and it has great historical significance.'' In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, governing party spokesman <PERSON> Park </PERSON> <PERSON> Hui-Tae </PERSON> used the occasion to prod Communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. `` On the occasion of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s border opening, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is urged once again to make active efforts to conduct exchanges with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and open up its doors in keeping pace with the tides of the time,'' he said. The European Community in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> pledged to seek closer trade relations with the government in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Calling Friday's events in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> reason `` for profound rejoicing throughout <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' The <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION>'s external affairs commissioner, <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON>, said he would contact the East German government `` to explore areas of mutual interest and support.''

 A Soviet spokesman said today that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s decision to open its borders was well received in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but he reiterated the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s opposition to reunification of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, chief spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, called the East German government's throwing open of its borders `` a sovereign act'' of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, reiterating the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s determination not to interfere in the internal affairs of its <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION> partners. But he reminded Soviet and foreign reporters at a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> briefing, `` The border still remains, though some might think it ceased to exist.'' East Berliners streamed into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> today following joyous overnight celebrations after <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> opened its borders. Thousands of East Germans also crossed into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> along the nations' frontier. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> cited a statement by East German leader <ORGANIZATION> Egon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> at a Nov. 1 press conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> at which <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> said the border exists `` due to other reasons'' and not for the purpose of interfering with contacts between people. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> pointed out then the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall marks the division between political systems as well as between the military alliances of East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said the border opening was part of the `` wide democratization of life'' taking place in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where the recent replacement of hard-line communist leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> touched off a popular rush toward reform. `` These are not separate acts but full-scale measures embracing the whole of life of the GDR -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- and its contacts with the outside world,'' the Soviet spokesman said. `` The measures that have been taken were welcomed'' in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, `` and there was also a positive reaction abroad, including in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' But <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> `` should take into account that policies aimed at reconsidering borders would not suit any government in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and would cause only mistrust.'' Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnandze </PERSON> today also welcomed the opening of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s border to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Swedish </LOCATION> journalists meeting with the envoy in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> reported. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> was quoted as saying the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> had nothing to do with the decision to open the gates in the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, which he said was an internal affair. `` It was decided by the comrades in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` This was a reasonable and sensible decision,'' he said, and he described the developments as `` a normal process'' toward greater democracy in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` The new course in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> echos the mood among the people in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. It also corresponds to our own interests,'' he said, according to a report by the Swedish national <ORGANIZATION> TT </ORGANIZATION> news agency and Swedish Radio in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, who met the reporters accompanying Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sten </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON>, said people should be helped to reunite with relatives or to travel abroad for other reasons, and said he was undisturbed by the sight of tens of thousands of East Germans flooding across the frontiers. `` Its not abnormal for people to leave their countries. Sometimes they return,'' he said. `` Twenty thousand people leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> every year. That in itself is not unusual.'' He also said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was not worried that the swift pace of events in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> would threaten global stability. The events in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have been covered on Soviet television and in the press but with little editorial comment. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the Soviet news agency, reported the opening of the borders without delay. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the past two years has eased the strict control of its borders and now grants thousands of exit visas a month to Soviet citizens wishing to travel abroad or emigrate. But relatively few Soviets are eligible to emigrate under present law. A bill before the legislature would grant all citizens the right to come and go as they please _ except in cases when the state determines national security might be threatened. But the measure is still up for debate.

<DATELINE>ERIE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After nearly a quarter-century in office and more than two years of battling an incurable disease, Mayor <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Tullio </PERSON> is stepping down and has appointed an aide to fill the remaining seven weeks of his term. Aides delivered a letter to the <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> city clerk today saying the six-term mayor has appointed <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Liebel </PERSON>, a longtime assistant, acting mayor effective immediately. `` We'll do the best we can. This is the way the mayor wants it,'' Ms. <PERSON> Liebel </PERSON> said late Thursday. Ms. <PERSON> Liebel </PERSON>, who lost a bid to win the Democratic mayoral nomination in the May primary, will fill the post only until Dec. 31. Two-term Councilwoman <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Savocchio </PERSON>, who was elected mayor Tuesday in this northwestern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> city of 120,000, takes over then. <PERSON> Tullio </PERSON> suffers from amyloidosis, a rare and fatal disease that deposits proteins in the heart, kidneys and other major organs. The illness has weakened <PERSON> Tullio </PERSON>'s heart and lungs amd confined him to his home since May. <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Caliguiri </PERSON> died of the same illnesss in May 1988. Over the summer, several <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members called for <PERSON> Tullio </PERSON> to appoint an acting mayor because of his illness. `` He had held off on naming an acting mayor because he hoped to return one day to the job he so loved,'' <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Tullio </PERSON>, the mayor's wife, said late Thursday `` But now he wants the work on the budget and the transition to <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Savocchio </PERSON>'s administration to go as smoothly as possible.'' <PERSON> Tullio </PERSON> technically will continue as mayor, receiving full pay and benefits, and said he would provide input into matters of city business. Ms. <PERSON> Liebel </PERSON>, who has been <PERSON> Tullio </PERSON>'s top aide since he took office in 1966, was to meet today with Mrs. <PERSON> Savocchio </PERSON> to discuss the transition. `` I promise to work with <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Liebel </PERSON> and the administration over the budget in this difficult time for the city,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Savocchio </PERSON>, a Democrat. <PERSON> Tullio </PERSON> assumed office 24 years ago after defeating incumbent Republican Mayor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON>.

 An civil rights group has asked the army to investigate reports of soldiers forcing Palestinians to perform `` ridiculous and humiliating tasks'' such as singing army songs and sweeping the streets. The <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has asked the army's legal adviser to stop the `` manifestly illegal'' practice in the Ein Bet al-Ma refugee camp in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, the group's lawyer `` They force the inhabitants to perform ridiculous and humiliating tasks such as sweeping streets, washing the streets, and so forth,'' said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. `` It's usually done in the middle of the night,'' he said. `` The people are called out, their ID cards are taken away from them and returned at the end of the work.'' <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials said today that a preliminary check indicated soldiers made residents of the camp clean up rubble from tires set on fire demonstrators. `` There's no initial indication of improper behavior by the soldiers, but the story is being investigated,'' said an army spokesman, who by Israeli army regulations can not be identified. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said the army legally can force Palestinians to remove roadblocks put up by demonstrators and to erase graffiti and can confiscate their identification cards while they do the work. But forcing Palestinians to clean streets and pick up cigarette butts and pebbles is `` manifestly illegal,'' he said. He also complained that six residents were made to march around the camp singing an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> army song one night last month. `` What we expect to hear is what the army is doing to make sure these things do not reoccur,'' he said. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said he probably will petition <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> if the army does not take action. He said the practices were `` a local kind of initiative'' and were not widespread. Also today, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers wounded a 12-year-old boy in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A Nicaraguan rebel leader today spurned a government proposal for his forces to disband and instead vowed at the first peace talks in 16 months to `` put an end' to the regime in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. Chief Contra negotiator <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, just before heading into the second day of talks today, said he had reason to `` doubt the sincerity'' of the Sandinista offer of a truce and amnesty. <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> did not offer a true amnesty but merely offered to release political prisoners from jail, stopping short of restoring their civil and political rights. Talks between the U.S.-backed Contra rebels and the Sandinista government opened Thursday. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s foreign minister said before the talks that if the rebels agreed to demobilize, his government would meet their demands for a truce and amnesty. The Contras countered with a plan to restore the cease-fire with the government, which was called off last week, and discuss other conditions _ such as demobilization _ later. Neither proposal was accepted, despite the urging of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> to renew the cease-fire that President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> ended. An estimated 12,000 people have been killed in the 8-year-old war. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> counterpart, <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Clemente </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>, turned the mediation effort over to aides. An election campaign is under way in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> under a regional peace accord signed in August. The plan calls for free and fair elections. Voting is set for Feb. 25, and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers say the campaign is proceeding smoothly. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Escoto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> said before the meeting that key Contra demands would be met if demobilization began by the end of November. Documents obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> showed the Contras' opening position calling for an immediate truce The Sandinistas would then declare a amnesty for the rebels by Nov. 20. The estimated 12,000 Contras camped in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> would then move into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, with their weapons, to join their comrades there in secure zones. Diplomats said this would remove the pressure placed on <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> under the Central American peace plan to shut down the Contra camps by Dec. 5. Only after these steps had been completed would discussion of disbanding the Contras begin, under the rebel proposal. Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON>, who leads <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s delegation to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> meeting, rejected the Contra proposal as presented. <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON>, waving a copy of Sandinista proposals, said the Contras say `` they require three things; the three things are met by what we are offering.'' <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> said the Nicaraguan delegation was willing to stay in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> beyond the two days allotted for the talks and would be flexible. `` This is a proposal, not an ultimatum,'' he said of the Sandinista document. In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, the Contras announced formation of a new `` civilian-military commission'' to replace the old directorate, several of whose members have resigned and returned to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Contra military spokesman <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> negotiating team led by <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> military commander <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> had recognized the new commission, which includes only one of the former directors, <PERSON> Aristides </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>. Ousted civilian Contra leaders compared the action to a coup. When <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> arrived for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> meeting, he said: `` We expect to re-establish the cease-fire and put an end to the totalitarian government in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' In refusing to renew the cease-fire after 19 weeks, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> cited increased Contra attacks in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Contra leaders denied the rebels were attacking, which is forbidden by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> while they still receive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ended <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the Contras in 1988, but has continued non-lethal aid. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, where most of the 12,000 Contras are encamped, and Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> are attending the peace talks as observers. The last direct talks between the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and Contras broke down in June 1988. They agreed to a 90-day cease-fire during that session, in March, and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> had extended it on a monthly basis, with tacit agreement from the Contras.

 Operators of a rayon plant that supplies the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> say it must remain open in defiance of the state's revocation of its waste water discharge permit so that it can clean up pollutants The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> voted 6-0 Thursday to revoke the permit of <ORGANIZATION> Avtex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fibers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s Front Royal plant effective immediately. The water board said <PERSON> Avtex </PERSON> violated the permit by discharging polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, into the <LOCATION> Shenandoah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tousignant </PERSON>, the plant's president, told reporters an orderly shutdown of the plant would take months and would halt the company's efforts to clean up the toxic chemical. `` We ca n't let this happen. It's not in anybody's best interest,'' he said. He maintained that an immediate shutdown is impossible and that the company could not clean up the PCBs without continuing to operate <PERSON> Avtex </PERSON>'s waste water treatment facility, which discharges into the river. `` If you're not operating, then you have no resources to do anything,'' he said. Avtex lawyers failed to persuade <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markow </PERSON> to stay the order and were considering an appeal to the state's <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, which was closed today for Veterans Day. <PERSON> Markow </PERSON> is to preside over a trial Wednesday of a state lawsuit seeking closure of the plant and fines and damages against <PERSON> Avtex </PERSON>. The permit revocation followed <PERSON> Markow </PERSON>'s rejections of two state requests to close the plant pending the trial. The company could be liable for as much as $ 10,000 a day in fines for making illegal discharges, said <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohrer </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state attorney general's office. During two days of hearings last week, the attorney general's office said state testing found as much as 3 -LCB- pounds of PCBs flowing toward the river daily in August The state said PCBs have contaminated the plant site since a December 1985 leak of some 500 gallons of the highly toxic oils from an electrical transformer. The state has accused <PERSON> Avtex </PERSON> and the federal government of knowingly allowing the pollution to continue, which <PERSON> Tousignant </PERSON> denied. `` When we found out ourselves that we had a problem, we took immediate action,'' he said. The federal government has worked for years to keep various pollution and worker safety problems from shutting the more than 50-year-old plant, which is the only supplier of a carbonizable rayon fiber used in rocket nozzles for the space shuttle and nuclear missiles. Water board members said they were concerned about the nearly 400 employees at Avtex who could lose their jobs, but they were more worried about the pollution. `` This was all brought about by actions and inactions on the part of Avtex,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON>, a board member. <PERSON> Velma </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, board chairwoman, said the board's investigation showed <ORGANIZATION> Avtex </ORGANIZATION> knew it had violated its permit by discharging PCBs long before it began cleaning up the toxins this year. `` Avtex did not take the issuance of a permit seriously,'' she said. The public found out about the pollution in May, when state officials warned people not to eat fish from the river.

 The opening of trading was delayed an hour today at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> stock exchanges because of a fire beneath a building that houses a key computer system. A spokeswoman at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> said a fire at the building housing the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s financial district made it impossible to process information, delaying the usual 9:30 a.m. opening of stock trading. Trading at both the American and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> exchanges finally opened at 10:30 a.m.. A Fire Department spokesman said the blaze erupted in an electrical vault below the building The first alarm sounded about 8 a.m. and the fire was under control by about 9:45 a.m. It was extinguished shortly after, the spokesman said. No injuries were reported. The lobby and the second floor of the 53-story building were evacuated, and some tenants on higher floors lost power. Light smoke filtered into the building from the fire underneath, the fire department said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lafayette </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said the fire did not affect trading systems, but uncertainty about the power supply led the company to suspend operations and switch to an emergency power source shortly before stock exchange trading was due to begin.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, lauding <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s lifting of travel restrictions as a dramatic advance for freedom, is ordering `` all possible assistance'' to help <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> cope with the flood of refugees from its communist sister state. And Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, reflecting today on Thursday's border-opening decree by East German authorities, said he hoped it would lead to greater freedoms. `` Hopefully, now they'll move in the area of other freedoms. Hopefully we'll see movement toward free and open democratic elections,'' he said on `` CBS This Morning.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, boarding his helicopter today for a trip to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, waved off questions about the fast-moving developments. Spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, however, that the president intended to talk to West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> by telephone later today. In another TV interview, on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said it was premature to talk about the reunification of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> because <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> had a long way to go before becoming truly democratic. `` There are some steps that have to be taken between just giving people one of the basic human rights, the freedom to travel, between that and addressing the question of reunification of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also linked Western financial aid to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to greater freedoms, including `` free and open'' elections. `` I think it's going to be the view, frankly, of some of our other allies that assistance will be much more forthcoming if the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democratic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- moves toward true reform, in terms of political pluralism across the board,'' he said. Nonetheless, the secretary said, `` I think it's the most dramatic event in East-West relations since the end of the war.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> acknowledged that the speed of the East German action caught <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials off guard. `` Were we surprised by the speed of it? You bet your life, and so was everybody else as far as I can determine,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't know anybody who suggested that they predicted this was going to happen. It's a very good development. I'm not the least bit ashamed of saying that the rapidness of it came as somewhat of a surprise.'' If <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> fully implements the promise to open its borders, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters Thursday, `` this -LRB- <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> -RRB- Wall built in'61 will have very little relevance.'' It was just 6 -LCB- months ago in a speech in <LOCATION> Mainz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added his voice to the chorus of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidents who have demanded that the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall be torn down. He called it then a `` brutal wall'' that `` stands as a monument to the failure of communism. It must come down!'' Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> television show `` Prime Time Live'' that `` If the wall is n't torn down immediately, at least they could keep the gates open.'' <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said it was opening its borders to the rest of the world and that its citizens may travel or emigrate anywhere, including through the 28-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Berlin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION>, erected at the height of the Cold War between East and West. `` It's a dramatic happening for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and, of course, for freedom,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The White House announced Thursday night that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had ordered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military units and <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> to give `` all possible assistance'' to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> government struggling to cope with the flood of refugees. The Pentagon said it was making available housing for 980 people in three off-base installations. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Flood </PERSON> said today there has been no new West German request for additional assistance, and there have been no new <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> offers of military assistance beyond what was made Thursday. Other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leaders reacted with a mixture of joy and surprise. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> called it a `` symbolic destruction of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall'' and urged <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to `` take the final step and tear that wall down.'' `` The events of today are truly remarkable,'' said Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, with Secretary of State <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> at his side and a map of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> open on his desk, said, `` We salute the people in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, whose aspirations for freedom seem to be a little more down the road now.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seemed subdued in an exchange with reporters summoned to the Oval Office to hear his reaction to the latest startling news from the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION>. `` I am not an emotional kind of guy,'' he explained. But he added, `` I feel very good about it.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was prepared to give `` maximum help'' to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> to cope with refugees. Some 200,000 East Germans have fled their country this year through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> or other routes West. But recalling his advice last spring to Poles to stay in their homeland to work for democratic reforms, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` These are Germans. And Germans love their country. And at some point, I think a lot of Germans who have felt pent-in and unable to move are going to say, ` Look, we can move but would n't it be better to participate in the reforms that are taking place in our own country?''' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that when he meets with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> next month in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, he would discuss additional steps the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> might take to help spur change in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> _ including possible restoration of long-denied <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade benefits. Sounding a note of caution, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I do n't think any single event is the end of what you might call the Iron Curtain, but clearly this is a long way from the harshest Iron Curtain days.'' At a state dinner for <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters he has sent a message to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> government saying he wants to talk to Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> when he returns from a visit to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Secretary of State <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s action is `` a very welcome and positive and significant development. ... I do n't think anybody would have predicted -LRB- it -RRB- three or four days ago.'' `` Hopefully, we'll see more steps toward freedom in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. `` Once people taste the fruits of freedom, you do n't put the genie back in the bottle.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said the odds of military forces from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> being used against the West appeared to be `` significantly lower now than at any time in the postwar period.'' Retired Army Gen. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, who was supreme allied commander in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> from 1979 to 1987, gave a similar assessment on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show this morning. `` I think that all indicators from at least 1987 on are that the threat of war is reduced. At least that should be our perception at the present time,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Rusk </PERSON>, who was President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s secretary of state when the wall was erected, said, `` I never thought I would live to see the day. The implications of it are very far-reaching. `` The West Germans may have a problem absorbing all the East Germans who will want to move there, but that's something the West Germans will just have to struggle with, said <PERSON> Rusk </PERSON>, now a law professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION>. `` But it's obvious that in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> several things have been set in motion that are irreversible and that can not be taken back to the worst of the Cold War days.''

 A pre-dawn Army shoot -'em - up _ complete with machine gun fire, flares and soldiers racing through civilians' yards _ has the sheriff, well, The mock military attack came on Thursday at 4:30 a.m., a time Sheriff <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Printz </PERSON> said was totally inappropriate. Calls from terrified residents came in so quickly `` my lone dispatcher could n't get everybody's name,'' <PERSON> Printz </PERSON> said. `` One woman was so scared she was calling from the bathroom, where'd she'd locked herself in,'' the sheriff said. Callers told of unidentified men firing automatic weapons and shooting flares and warriors racing across the deck of a private house, <PERSON> Printz </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> was `` essentially having a little war'' in an area just outside <LOCATION> Corvallis </LOCATION>, which is south of <LOCATION> Missoula </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Printz </PERSON> said. Complaints focused on rude disruptions in the pre-dawn, trespass on private property, spooked livestock bouncing off barbed-wire fences and potential fires from flares on roofs, the sheriff said. Army officials refused to say anything other than there would be an investigation of the complaints. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> said her family thought it was a `` war zone'' outside. Her husband got his rifle and fired a round into a wood pile to scare off the soldiers, she said. The woman said military investigators came by later and told her the special forces troops were making a mock attempt to blow up a fuel depot. She noted there are some fuel storage tanks a few hundred yards from the family residence. <PERSON> Printz </PERSON> said he was told last summer that parts of `` Exercise Knife Blade 90'' would occur in <LOCATION> Ravalli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> this fall. He was never informed about specific operations but was promised they would not be near residential areas, he said. He told military officials that if there's another similar occurrence, deputies will be making arrests, <PERSON> Printz </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>BBC Broadcasts to China Being Jammed For First Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday its Mandarin-language broadcasts to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are being jammed for the first time. `` There is no possible justification for this deliberate and systematic interference with our broadcasts, although it clearly indicates the impact the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is having inside <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as far as the authorities are concerned,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tusa </PERSON>, managing director of the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> said the interference typically starts a few minutes before the Mandarin transmissions begin and stops shortly after they end. It takes the form of a steady, low-frequency noise about 25 percent as strong as the program signal itself. The <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> said it did not know exactly how long the interference had been taking place. There has been evidence of it since June but it was only positively identified this week by a <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> engineer in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, it said. `` Jamming is a practice which violates established broadcasting relations,'' <PERSON> Tusa </PERSON> said. `` This latest instance is particularly regrettable at a time when jamming from all other Communist countries has ceased.'' The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> stopped jamming <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> Russian service broadcasts in 1987 and lifted its interference with <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> Polish broadcasts a year later. The <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> said World Service broadcasts in English are not being jammed by the Chinese but it is still unclear whether Cantonese language broadcasts are affected. The <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> said it stepped up its Mandarin broadcasts by half an hour in early June to a total of three hours daily in response to demands for coverage of the student-led demonstrations in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the government's crackdown. During the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> protests, students carried banners saying `` Thank you <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION>'' and some wore <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> headbands.

 More than 36,000 people have turned themselves in for economic crimes during a 10-week grace period that ended last week, a senior judicial official said Friday. They included 9,300 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members and one vice minister, and three people who embezzled more than $ 270,000, said deputy chief prosecutor <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Siqing </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and prosecutor's office announced Aug. 15 that all who turned themselves in before Oct. 31 for economic crimes would be treated leniently. Those who confessed admitted receiving bribes and embezzling $ 94 million, and returned the equivalent of $ 56 million in `` ill-gotten gains,'' the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> as saying. Since the call went out in August, 17,600 government employees confessed to receiving bribes and other actions `` in violation of discipline,'' <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> newspapers reported last week that factory bosses, managers and midlevel business officials were among those who surrendered during the campaign.

 A team of observers from the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> dashed out of the voter registration station and scrambled into a caravan of waiting vehicles. In the confusion, some of them jumped into a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> jeep at the curb and ordered the bewildered driver: `` Follow that caravan!'' When the string of vehicles screeched to a halt at the next station and the observers again jumped out, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> driver peeled off and returned to his employers, hoping they had n't missed him. `` There are so many observers in this little country, you find them in the soup,'' said a Latin American diplomatic source who requested anonymity. `` But that is good. We'd rather have too many than too few.'' Foreign observers are swarming all over <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in such profusion that the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> felt compelled to call a news conference to explain who is doing what. There are observers for the electoral process leading to general elections Feb. 25; observers to make sure the anti-Sandinista rebels known as Contras disband; observers to a regional accord not to arm guerrillas; and self-appointed observers of foreign contributions to political parties. A 625-member force approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> is the latest addition to the battalions of observers in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. They are to verify that Contras do n't slip across the border from <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` Observing elections has become an industry,'' said <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> government observer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` But who's observing the observers?'' There are observer teams from the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, joint commissions from both organizations, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government foundation and one private <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foundation. Apart from that, there are individuals and groups representing the political spectrum descending on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in droves. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen come down singly or in clusters. `` It seems like we get one every weekend,'' said a Western diplomatic source. `` I do n't know the last time we had a full weekend off.'' <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON> headed his organization's mission to observe the first Sunday of registration, Oct. 1. He and his retinue visited 35 voter registration stations in five communities within 12 hours. The confusion over the jeeps happened at one of those stations. In <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s severely depressed economy, observers are good business. They need housing, food, transportation. They need office space, drivers and secretaries. Housing in the <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> area, the center of operations for all these groups, is scarce. The laws of demand and supply take over. Property rental agents are delighted. But the observer staff members are not. `` I was shown the same house three times in one day, by three different agents,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer. `` Every time the -LRB- rental -RRB- price was different _ each time it was higher.'' The observers' first job was to watch over voter registration during the first four Sundays in October. It ended Oct. 22. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> released reports calling the registration process largely free and fair. Now their job is to keep watch over the campaigning and ensure every one of the 21 legally registered parties in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has a chance to spread its message freely.

<TEXT>
 State police were warned by the state's chief justice six years ago to stop taping private conversations between attorneys and their clients, but the taping continued, and led to a federal lawsuit The class action lawsuit filed Thursday names the state and 19 high-ranking state police officials allegedly involved in secret taping as far back as 1980. `` Hundreds of thousands'' of conversations may have been taped at about a dozen state police barracks around the state, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Koskoff </PERSON>, a lawyer who called a news conference to announce the lawsuit. In 1983, former state Chief Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Speziale </PERSON> warned police to stop tape-recording suspects' telephone conversations with their lawyers. `` Eavesdropping by the police or their agents makes a mockery of the right to consult counsel before being interrogated,'' <PERSON> Speziale </PERSON> wrote in a 1983 ruling on a 1980 tape recording of a lawyer talking to his client. The taping resurfaced inadvertantly Oct. 24 when a state trooper testified at a hearing in a manslaughter case that a conversation between the suspect and his attorney had been taped. Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> on Tuesday ordered an investigation into the taping policy, and Thursday, federal prosecutors asked Chief State's Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> to turn over the 763 state police tapes _ containing 18,000 hours of conversations _ that were impounded when <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> opened the probe. State police claim the taping was done to ensure that emergency telephone calls to the barracks could be replayed in case the call was unclear or if someone had a complaint about the way a call was handled. The taping posed a political problem for <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, a Democrat up for re-election next year. His adversaries in both parties called on him to fire State Police Cmdr. <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Forst </PERSON>, the lead defendant in the case. The lawsuit seeks damages of at least $ 10,000 for each person who joins the class action, and punitive damages under federal racketeering statutes. `` If anybody made a phone call from the state police barracks and spoke to someone other than a police officer, they can pretty well assume their phone call was intercepted,'' <PERSON> Koskoff </PERSON> said at the news conference. `` We even had information there were police officers who did n't even know these phones were being tapped.'' The lawsuit could overturn criminal convictions if the court found an illegally taped conversation led to the conviction, said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON>, president of the 200-member <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which filed the suit. `` People make the most damaging admissions when they're arrested because they're upset,'' <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON> said, adding, `` I suppose nothing should should shock us. But to violate the right to counsel, to do that knowingly ...'' Normally, police must obtain warrants to conduct secret wiretaps or tape conversations. The taping also appears to have violated privileged lawyer-client conversations. <PERSON> Forst </PERSON> has been on a hunting vacation in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said Wednesday he was not inclined to fire <PERSON> Forst </PERSON>, whom he hired in 1981, before speaking with him. The state police is not the only department in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> to stand accused of secret taping. The <ORGANIZATION> Waterbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> reported today that police in <LOCATION> Torrington </LOCATION>, a town north of 30,000 of <LOCATION> Waterbury </LOCATION>, routinely taped conversations between prisoners and lawyers and at least once refused a lawyer's demand that the taping be stopped. Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> said he helped another lawyer, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Buono </PERSON>, get charges against a client reduced because tapes had been made of <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Buono </PERSON>'s conversations with the client a year ago even though <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Buono </PERSON> objected. <LOCATION> Torrington </LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON> Mahlon </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabo </PERSON> said he was unaware of the taping until Thursday and it would be stopped. The department makes tapes of all calls on the department's main business line, and because of equipment shortages, the telephone that prisoners use is hooked up to that line, he said. `` I'm embarrassed I did n't know,'' said <PERSON> Sabo </PERSON>, who's been chief about 3 -LCB- years. `` I do n't know why, and this -LRB- phone system -RRB- certainly has been here a lot longer than I have.''

 Philippine President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> had breakfast today with Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and U.S.-backed Nicaraguan opposition candidate <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, and a <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> aide said the administration hoped some of the visiting leader's popularity would rub off. Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> is in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this week seeking to raise funds for her February election against leftist President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. A Quayle aide, <PERSON> Carnes </PERSON> <PERSON> Lord </PERSON>, said the two women _ both the wives of slain national leaders _ discussed their common experiences in entering politics. Asked if Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> hoped to cash in on some of Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s popularity, <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> said, `` That was the idea, obviously. He said the three-way meeting at the vice president's residence had been suggested to Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> during <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s recent visit to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> is not dropping any clues about the fate of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases in her country, but President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he is confident an agreement will be reached for a `` long-term security partnership.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was effusive in his praise for Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> during meetings at the White House on Thursday despite her reluctance to discuss continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> access to <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Air </PERSON> <PERSON> Base </PERSON> and Subic Bay Naval Base. `` From Main Street to Wall Street, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> loves the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. And <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> loves <PERSON> Cory </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in welcoming remarks. `` You deserve our help and you will get it. I pledge our continuing assistance to your government, and that means security assistance as well as aid to economic development,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` And it means cooperating in your important debt-reduction programs.'' The future of the two massive bases is the most important _ and most controversial _ issue on the U.S.-Philippine agenda. Leases for the facilities expire in September 1991, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> regards them as a vital for projecting American military power throughout <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> sea </LOCATION> lanes and for stability in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. They serve as a counterpoint to Soviet naval forces based in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> faces pressure at home to end the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> access. An influential minority of Filipinos view the continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence as an infringement on Philippine sovereignty and a vestige of the former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> colonial administration. Before leaving <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> today, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> planned to meet with <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. Then, she was heading to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> to meet with officials of the large retailing chain, <PERSON> J.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Penney </PERSON>, a major importer of Philippine products. In a toast at a state dinner Thursday night, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lauded her `` monumental'' political and economic accomplishments and said her country's revolution had inspired `` freedom-loving people everywhere.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, in a poignant reply, said, `` The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> is a small country and can not claim to affect directly events beyond its borders; certainly not across half the world in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' But, after reciting the `` startling'' changes underway in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION>, she said: `` Yet it is not too much to say that the images of heroism spawned by our people power revolution gave dominated peoples throughout the world a glimpse of certain possibilities that they are now exploring _ the possibility, for example, that armor and infantry do not exhaust the varieties of power.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> told reporters after the dinner, `` Many times people approach me in my travels abroad and say they are truly inspired by what happened in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> in 1986. I'm very glad we're identified with something so noble and so pure. Earlier at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> noted that preliminary talks on the bases will begin next month and said, `` We are confident we'll mold a new and mutually beneficial long-term security partnership in the future. Steering clear of the basing issue, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> emphasized the themes of trade and investment. `` We will raise particularly the means by which the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can cooperate in more ways to our mutual economic benefit. We shall explore the means to increase trade between two countries with long historic ties and deep cultural affinities.'' It was her first visit to the White House since 1986 when she received a tumultuous welcome after leading the successful campaign to depose President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, ending years of authoritarian rule. `` Your leadership has made the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> a beacon of democracy, worthy of imitation throughout the world,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. In their talks, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> mentioned the bases only in `` a passing reference'' to next month's talks, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> affairs. He said Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> expressed no sentiment one way or the other.

While <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> rushed through a $ 200 million aid package for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> after Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> took office, there is less eagerness now because some lawmakers believe economic reform and increased trade would improve living standards there more than additional economic aid.

 People who bought tickets for airline flights canceled by <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> when it shut down operations this week may be able to get refunds if their purchase was made with a credit card, the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> says. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said consumers who charged tickets for flights canceled by the airline may be able to use the `` billing error'' protections of the Fair Credit Billing Act to avoid paying for the tickets. The commission recommended on Thursday that travelers with canceled tickets send a written notice to the credit card issuer at the address listed on their bill for inquiries about billing errors. The notice should include: _ The person's name and account number _ Aa statement that payment is being withheld or a refund is being requested because the bill contains an error _ A description of the error, including dollar amount and the reference number of the ticket transaction Consumers should keep a photocopy of the notice and send the original by certified mail, return receipt requested, within 30 days after receiving the first bill that contains the ticket charge. The agency also suggested people keep the ticket in case the card issuer later asks for evidence.

<HEAD>26 Cases of Blood Disorder Cited, Officials Probe Link to Amino Acid
Tablets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Health officials are investigating whether an outbreak of a rare blood disorder that has affected 26 people in five states is linked to a dietary supplement taken for stress and premenstrual syndrome. Twenty-one cases of eosinophilia have been confirmed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> over the past two to three months, Dr. <PERSON> Millicent </PERSON> <PERSON> Eidson </PERSON>, environmental epidemiologist with the state <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said late Thursday. She said an additional case has been reported in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. The Mayo Clinic in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, said a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> man and a <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> woman are being treated for the disease, and an <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> said two cases have been reported in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. At least 19 of the patients had been taking L-tryptophan, an amino acid commonly taken to relieve premenstrual syndrome, sleep disorders, muscle tension and stress. The non-prescription tablets are sold under a variety of brand names in health food stores and pharmacies. Eosinophilia occurs when there is an abnormally high number of eosinophils, a type of white cell, in the blood. It has been known to be fatal, although officials said there have been no deaths among the recent 26 cases. Ms. <PERSON> Eidson </PERSON> said of the cases in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, 17 were among women. Sixteen of the 17 women and one of the five men had taken L-tryptophan, she said. Teams from the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> came to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> on Thursday to assist in the investigation. Dr. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilbourne </PERSON>, chief of the Health Studies Branch of the Division of <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hazards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Effects </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>, said the out-of-state cases `` raises the ante a bit.'' <PERSON> Kilbourne </PERSON>, who planned to arrive in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> on Monday, said all agencies are being very cautious about making a connection between L-tryptophan and the cluster of eosinophilia cases. `` The problem is an epidemic association and as far as I am aware it is not very solid,'' he said. Ms. <PERSON> Eidson </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> patients suffered severe muscle pain and 10 were hospitalized. She said today that one woman was still hospitalized early this week but she did n't know if the patient has since been released <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> health officials have asked retailers to halt sales of L-tryptophan. Dr. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleich </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Mayo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> said both the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> patients had taken L-tryptophan. `` The thing that's unusual is seeing so many patients with the same pattern,'' <PERSON> Gleich </PERSON> said. `` It's not like we have n't seen the likes of this before. What's different is there are so many at one time, and they're all taking L-tryptophan.'' Dr. <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> also has reported two cases, but he could provide no details except that one of the cases apparently involved L-tryptophan. He planned to contact the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> to investigate the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> incidents.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> inaugurated the first <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> exhibit of Russian religious art Friday and said the icons symbolized the roots of Christianity in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He was guided through the exhibit of 107 medieval works by J.S. <PERSON> Meldev </PERSON>, minister of culture for the Russian republic. <PERSON> Meldev </PERSON> noted that the exhibit opened `` on the eve of an historic meeting,'' a reference to <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s scheduled audience with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> during the Soviet president's visit to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> on Nov. 29-Dec. 1 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> nodded and smiled at the remark. In his speech, he said: `` The art of the East and of the West is the expression of the unique Christian spirit, and, in a manner of speaking, the ` breathing' of those ` two lungs' of European Christianity, Western and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which should contribute equally ... to the recovery of the Christian roots of the European people.'' He also linked the exhibit to last year's 1,000 anniversary of the introduction of Christianity in what now is the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He said the celebrations prompted `` a spontaneous ray of light, rich in further promise and developments, which lead to hope of a deeper accord between East and West.'' Works on display, dating from the 13th to 18th centuries, include faces of Christ, the <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> and child, saints, and scenes of Christmas and other religious celebrations. The exhibit, at the Braccio de <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Magno </PERSON> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, opens to the public Saturday and runs through Jan. 30.

<DATELINE>FAIZABAD, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police arrested 1,000 Moslem protesters Friday who tried to march to nearby <LOCATION> Ayodhya </LOCATION>, where celebrating Hindus laid the foundation stone of a new temple at a site claimed by both religions. The Moslem demonstration was peaceful, but <PERSON> Zafaryab </PERSON> <PERSON> Jilani </PERSON>, one of its leaders, declared: `` When all these methods fail, arms are taken up. The next generation may not listen to peaceful protest.'' At least 290 people have been killed in Hindu-Moslem violence in three Indian states since plans for the temple were announced in August. No violence has been reported in <LOCATION> Faizabad </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Ayodhya </LOCATION>. Protest leaders in <LOCATION> Faizabad </LOCATION> accused Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of giving in to Hindu fundamentalists in a quest for Hindu votes in national elections set for Nov. 22, 24 an 26. `` If this ruling <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is ousted from power, perhaps secular government can be saved,'' said <PERSON> Jilani </PERSON>, a senior leader of the <ORGANIZATION> All-India </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Babri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Masjid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Babri </PERSON> <PERSON> Masjid </PERSON>, the Mosque of <PERSON> Babar </PERSON>, was built in the 17th century on the spot in <LOCATION> Ayodhya </LOCATION> where Hindu fundamentalists claim one of their most popular gods, Lord Ram, was born. About 90 minutes after the arrests in <LOCATION> Faizabad </LOCATION>, Hindus celebrated the laying of the foundation stone of a new Ram temple 130 feet from the Babar Mosque. They flung marigold petals into a 6-foot-deep hole in which their leaders reverently placed bricks and the stone. Police wearing helmets and chest protectors struggled to keep from falling into the pit as at least 5,000 pilgrims pushed into the small, hilltop enclave in less than an hour. The dispute over the <LOCATION> Ayodhya </LOCATION> hilltop in <LOCATION> Uttar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> state is centuries old and the current chapter began on a night in 1949, when a Ram idol was spirited into the mosque. A court ordered the mosque closed to people of both faiths in an effort to prevent religious strife. In 1986, another court order opened the Babar Mosque, but only to Hindus. That decision prompted riots across <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> in which at least 200 people died. Currently, the argument centers on who owns the land where the foundation is being laid. Hindus and Moslems agree the small plot intended for the stone is owned by a Hindu, but the rest of the landed needed for the temple remains in dispute. Although Moslems opposed construction of the temple, they agreed they could not prevent the stone from being laid in the plot owned by a Hindu. Late Thursday night, however, Moslem activists contended the foundation site was spilling over to property they claim is Moslem. Courts in <LOCATION> Uttar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> state, where <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> controls the government, have declined to rule who owns the property. `` After today, Moslems will not vote for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Azam </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Uttar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> state legislator from the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday. <PERSON> Azam </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Jilani </PERSON>, is a convenor _ a sort of senior organizer _ of the <ORGANIZATION> Babri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Masjid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Both were among those arrested in <LOCATION> Faizabad </LOCATION>. The arrests were part of a uniquely Indian form of peaceful protest in which people do something they know police will not allow, such as marching to <LOCATION> Ayodhya </LOCATION>, thus inviting arrest. The police oblige by rounding them up, generally with little or no force. In <LOCATION> Faizabad </LOCATION>, the Moslems and at least 40 Hindu sympathizers climbed willingly into freight-hauling trucks and waved as they were driven to a police compound on the outskirts. At the compound, they sat on the ground listening to leaders exhort them to preserve <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> as a secular state and vote <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and his party out of office. Moslems, who make up 11 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 880 million people, have given the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> strong support since <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1947 <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> faces a tough challenge from Vishwanath <PERSON> Pratap </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> coalition </ORGANIZATION>, and the Moslem vote could be pivotal.

 Americans have lavished praise on President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> during her visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but at home she faces declining popularity. `` From Main Street to Wall Street, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> loves the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>,'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> at the White House on Thursday. `` And <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> loves <PERSON> Cory </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>.'' But a recent survey of 300 <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> residents showed that only 35 percent were satisfied with their president. Two years ago, a survey by the same pollster, the Social Weather Stations, indicated a 77 percent approval rating for Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s remarks were typical of the reception Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has received during her North American tour. She arrived in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> on Nov. 4 and traveled Tuesday to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. After <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, she is to visit <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` The attentive observer with an eye constantly cocked for exquisite ironies would not miss this one: of apparent cheers for the president on foreign soil and tears and jeers on her home base,'' wrote columnist <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcellano </PERSON> in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. Columnist <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Beltran </PERSON>, traveling with Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, noted the enthusiastic welcomes she has received from Filipino expatriates in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` It is as if Filipinos abroad are caught in a time warp,'' <PERSON> Beltran </PERSON> wrote in The <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> Standard. National leaders often enjoy a more favorable image abroad than at home, and Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s aides routinely dismiss criticism as the carpings of opposition groups jealous of power. But even her supporters acknowledge growing public disaffection because of rising prices, crime, corruption, lack of basic services and a failure to fulfill many of promises of the `` people power revolution'' that ousted <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and brought Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power. Much of the dissatisfaction stems from economic problems. Despite a 6 percent economic growth, inflation has reached more than 13 percent, with the greatest increases in food. The country's electric power system is in such deplorable condition that the state-run <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, has begun a system of two-hour rotating brownouts throughout <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> island to cope with the shortage. Public school teachers, <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> staffers and other government employees began a series of strikes this week over pay demands and delays in receiving promised salary differentials. Crime is widespread, due in part to corruption within the police and armed forces. There have been so many robberies of buses in western areas of <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> island that the military has begun providing armed escorts for vehicles. Police say the crime rate between January and September was 1.4 percent above the figure for all of last year. More than 15 percent of all crimes reported took place in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. Critics also claim Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> tends to make grandiose promises without keeping them. She promised justice to victims of a January 1977 incident in which troops killed 12 protesters. No one was ever charged in the incident after the commission she established to investigate effectively exonerated the troops. The senior officer at the scene, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Montano </PERSON>, was later promoted to major general and placed in command of the national police.

<HEAD>Japanese Whaling Ship Leaves for Antarctic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The first of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s four-ship whaling fleet left Friday for the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION>, where officials say it will catch 300 of the mammals as part of a research program conservationists call commercial whaling in disguise. The ship, the Nisshin Maru No. 3, will arrive in the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> in December, where it will be joined by three catcher boats, said <PERSON> Nobuyuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Yagi </PERSON>, a Fishery Agency official. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> halted commercial whaling in the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> at the end of the 1986-87 season, during which it caught 1,941 whales. It then began a program of research whaling which it says is aimed at assessing whale stocks. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> killed 273 small minke whales, a non-endangered species, in the first year of the research program and 241 last year. In 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whaling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> imposed a moratorium on commercial whaling to allow scientists to assess whale stocks without the disruption caused by regular whaling activities. However, under the organization's charter, member nations are allowed to conduct research whaling whenever they wish. The official said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> hopes its research will prove that enough of some species remain to allow a resumption of limited commercial whaling when the commission's moratorium comes up for review next year. `` But judging from the current positions of the members of the commission, it looks very unlikely that the ban will be lifted,'' he said. Japanese whaling officials have said that at least 825 whales must be caught to make the research program scientifically accurate, and the quota for the program's first year was initially 875. But strong opposition from international environmental groups and other commission members led <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to reduce the quota to 300. The meat obtained by the research program is sold for food, as permitted under commission regulations. At an annual meeting of the 38-member commission in June, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> also asked for special permission to catch 320 minke whales along its coast to `` alleviate the suffering'' of several whaling towns where it said 789 people have lost their jobs because of the ban. The request was turned down by the commission. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is the world's largest consumer of whale meat, and officials say the food is an important part of the country's culture In the early 1960s, when Japanese whaling was at its peak, whales provided 23 percent of all meat consumed in the country. Since then, declining whale supplies have turned it into a delicacy, and the <ORGANIZATION> Nisshin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maru </ORGANIZATION> is the only remaining processing ship. Whaling officials say whales must be killed during the research to accurately determine their age, sex, diet and health. But anti-whaling groups say non-lethal research methods are available, such as skin sampling. Minke whales, a smaller species, are currently estimated by the <ORGANIZATION> IWC </ORGANIZATION> to number about 730,000, <PERSON> Yagi </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> also conduct research whaling, but <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> has announced it will end its research whaling program at the end of this season.

 Americans, Italians and others clambered up the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall on Friday to join Germans from both sides of the divide in an exuberant celebration of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s newly opened borders. `` I've seen this wall many times, and I'm glad to see it break open,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldier who joined the hundreds atop the graffiti-covered concrete barrier at the city's hallmark <LOCATION> Brandenburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gate </LOCATION>. `` It should have happened a long time ago, this freedom _ that's what we're here for,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>, who is based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Two jackbooted Soviet soldiers standing guard at the massive Soviet World War II memorial less than 200 yards to the west of the wall watched impassively. Champagne bottles littered the base of the wall. On the other side, scores of unarmed East German soldiers _ some grim, others bemused _ kept an eye on the throng on top of the barrier. A nearby brass band drowned out shouts and the milling crowd paralyzed local traffic on the wall's west side. The celebrations began late Thursday when Communist authorities threw open East German borders for the first time since the Berlin Wall rose in 1961. On Friday, authorities said they would forever lift all travel restrictions and begin knocking down a portion of the wall. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>, 20, and another <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldier, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolentino </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said neither they nor the city had slept since the first wave of East Germans began pouring into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. `` I worked midnight shift last night, and I'm going to work midnight shift tonight, and I do n't think I'm going to get much rest in between,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Waltham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, a modern dancer from <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, said friends had told him of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s decision to permit its citizens unrestricted travel abroad, `` and I still do n't believe it.'' `` I was sure the wall was here to stay at least till the turn of the century,'' but the decision to permit free travel for East Germans had now changed his mind, he said. <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauria </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> said he felt anticipation mixed with the joy of celebrants atop and near the wall. `` People are waiting for something,'' he said. `` This thing is not over yet.'' His neighbor, <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> <PERSON> Puzzilli </PERSON>, said he felt fortunate to be visiting <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> at this historic time. `` This is a very important moment,'' he said. `` You have to feel for these people, who have been waiting for such a long time.'' <PERSON> Jozsef </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudas </PERSON>, of Miskolc, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, said he felt special empathy for the East Germans. `` If it were n't for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, this would n't have happened,'' he said, alluding to his country's initial role in the exodus of East Germans wanting to settle in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Since <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> threw open its western border to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> Sept. 10 to East Germans wishing to turn their back on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc, more than 50,000 of them have used <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> as a springboard to the West. Others have used <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. At Checkpoint <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON>, three miles down the wall, officials lost count of how many East Berliners had crossed into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> since the border was opened. `` It must be tens of thousands,'' said one West German border official. Early morning reports in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> spoke of about 50,000 people. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> construction workers still wearing their hard hats drank beer and toasted their first experience in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, watched by about 200 curious Westerners. There were jubilant scenes at other border crossings and East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berliners </LOCATION> joined in a never-ending party they had been awaiting for decades. The wall, which has divided <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and symbolized the division of East and West for decades, was built to stop the flow of East Germans fleeing to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> _ 2.5 million from 1949 until Aug. 13, 1961. More than 20,000 Berliners gathered Friday outside the <LOCATION> Schoeneberg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, where President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> proclaimed `` Ich bin <PERSON> ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Berliner </PERSON>'' on June 26, 1963. `` There are some who say that Communism is the wave of the future. Let them come to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` And there are some who say in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and elsewhere, ` We can work with the Communists.' Let them come to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. `` And there are even a few who say that it's true that Communism is an evil system, but it permits us to make economic progress. Let them come to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. `` Freedom has many difficulties and democracy is not perfect. But we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in, to prevent them from leaving us.'' Every president since has repeated <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s plea to tear the wall down. Former West German Chanellor <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> when the wall went up in 1961, said prospects for <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> unity had taken a major step forward with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s opening of its borders. `` The Berlin Wall will come down, and <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> will live,'' <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> today stepped down after 35 years in power, longer than any current Eastern European leader, in the latest upheaval in the Soviet bloc. <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>, who molded <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> into one of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s most loyal modern allies, was replaced by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Petar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON>, the news agency said. <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>, 78, also resigned from the ruling Politburo, and the party's policy-setting <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> proposed that he be relieved of his post as state president, the official <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON>, 53, has been foreign minister since 1971 and is considered more open to reform than <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>. The changes occurred at a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting. During the meeting, about 150 followers of the independent Society for the <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> held a rally in a nearby park, the latest gathering by a growing pro-reform movement. Police vans were parked nearby, but officers did not interfere. <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> had been rumored to be on his way out for two years, but diplomats and dissidents said the leadership change at this juncture was unexpected. They said they had expected <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> to be ousted from the party leadership because he had reportedly angered party hard-liners by pushing to hold an international meeting in <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> last week, an occassion that allowed independent groups to campaign publicly for reform. Although <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> had paid lip-service to reform, the leadership has so far not implemented the kind of broad political reforms enacted in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, where the Communists have significantly loosened their grip on power. <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> gained ultimate power as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief in 1954 with the backing of Bulgarian supporters of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, the Soviet dictator. Two years later he sided with <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s successor and ideological foe. Dogmatic and conservative by temperament and training, <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> displayed surprising ability in smoothing over party dissent to emerge with his leadership strenghtened. He began consolidating his power upon assuming the leadership, purging opponents and sending the most dangerous ones into exile. By 1964, his authority was firm enough to survive an anti-Khrushchev backlash. A year later he emerged unscathed from a conspiracy to remove him. The brief <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> dispatch said the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> formally thanked him for his `` long selfless service to the party and the people.'' It was latest development in a tumultuous year of social and political change in eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. On Thursday, East German leader <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> opened the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall and other Western borders, the most breathtaking development in a three-week whirlwind of reform in a country that was once so resistant to Soviet-style reforms. <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>'s resignation comes exactly one week after thousands of demonstrators rallied in the capital, <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION>, in the first known pro-reform rally in postwar <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> has long resisted the reforms introduced by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, but about a dozen small civil rights groups have formed in recent months. <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> and other senior officials had pledged to work toward separating party and state functions and introducing a measure of democracy by ammending the constitution. On Friday, a crowd estimated at up to 9,000 took part in a demonstration that coincided with the last day of a 35-nation conference on protection of the environment. Protesters reported chanted `` Democracy!'' and `` Glasnost!'' _ <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of openness. No such demonstration has taken place in the Bulgarian capital since the end of World War II. <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sofia </ORGANIZATION> reported today that the two main points on the meeting agenda were the development of economic restructuring in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and a preliminary discussion on preparing the 14th <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION>, scheduled in November 1990. Diplomats here say there is growing awareness that economic reforms, badly needed to revamp a stagnating economy, can not be carried out without some political changes. A report released by <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> before today's meeting acknowledged this. `` The real problem is to specify what changes will be introduced in our political system, in the structure and way of functioning of power, as well as in the party, by which we will move ahead the political reform and bring it into conformity with the restructuring of the socio-economic and intellectual life,'' he said.

<HEAD>Communications Program Contains Provisions Troubling For West</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> commission Friday approved a program for the first half of the 1990s containing provisions on global communication and news distribution that are troubling to some Western observers. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, which pulled out of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION>, Scientific and Cultural Organization in the mid-1980s in part over anti-Western bias, have said the agency's decisions on communications will play a major role in determining whether they return. Many old code words about protection of journalists and government licensing and censorship powers are gone from the proposed program. But the plan sets up an adversary relationship between the media and the public by saying the public should be educated to avoid manipulation by the media. It also reiterates the legitimacy of the new world information and communications order, which Western opponents regard as a threat to international reporting and news distribution. <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Bullen </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said there were `` some welcome things'' in the new program `` but <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> still has a way to go before it becomes a beacon for press freedom.'' The head of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> observer mission <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> described the document as ambiguous and complex. He said it would have to be reviewed before any decision on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> return to the organization after leaving it in 1985. British observers made similar comments. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the proposed strategy did not resolve the controversy over the new world order but had positive references to the independence of media, pluralism and diversity of opinion. The two nations, which between them provided 30 percent of <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION>'s budget, had charged that the organization had become anti-Western, spent too much and was poorly managed. <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> Director General <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, who took over as head of the troubled agency two years ago, has been trying to remove references to this order from the communications program and take a new direction. But the 50-nation Executive Board, where Third World and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc nations have a majority, have watered down Mayor's proposals and resurrected controversies on communications that have been debated at <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> since the 1970s. Canadian spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> McPhail </PERSON> said Mayor could be proud of the outcome because `` under his leadership freedom of the press has returned to the halls of <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION>.'' Many media specialists maintain the concept of a new world information and communication order has become outmoded, given the substantial progress in communications technology in the past 10 years. They said the way to remove imbalances is to strengthen the communications capabilities of developing countries. But Third World nations believe there still are imbalances in the flow of information to them, with a dominant role for Western media. These nations, led by <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, succeeded in getting several references in the program to their charge that Western media report about them in a false and distorted way. The program was approved by consensus, that is without a vote, after three days and nights of lengthy, sometimes tense debate. It now goes before the General Conference of the 161-nation <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION>, which is expected to approve it next week before adjourning. The conference is the agency's highest decision making body and meets every two years.

 Armed Sikh separatists stormed one of the country's most prestigious engineering colleges before dawn Friday, killing 19 students sleeping in a dormitory, police said. The militants, armed with Chinese-made AK-47 rifles, entered <ORGANIZATION> Thapar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and knocked on the door of the dormitory, said a police spokesman. When one of the students opened the door, the gunmen opened fire, he said. Police said the gunmen were believed to be Sikh extremists fighting for an independent homeland in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, a rich farming state on the northern border with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. `` When I awoke, I saw a man with a gun firing indiscriminately,'' student <PERSON> Umesh </PERSON> <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> said from his bed in <LOCATION> Patiala </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Rajendra </PERSON> <PERSON> Hospital </PERSON>. `` Before I could get up, I was hit by a bullet and then I do n't know what happened.'' At least 16 people died instantly and three died later of their injuries. Five other students remained hospitalized, doctors said. The victims were from colleges in neighboring states who had come to attend the school's annual youth festival, said the police spokesman, who can not be identified under briefing rules. The attack occurred at 2:30 a.m., hours before Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, for a brief visit. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> made no public statement on attack. <LOCATION> Patiala </LOCATION>, in southern <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, is about 45 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Thapar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, one of the best known institutions in northern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, has about 1,500 students. About 200 others had come for the youth festival. Sikh extremists have killed at least 1,544 people this year in their bid to carve out a separate homeland they want to call <LOCATION> Khalistan </LOCATION>, or `` Land of the Pure.'' The radicals allege Sikhs are socially and culturally discriminated against by the Hindu majority and the Hindu-dominated government. Sikhs make up 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 880 million people but are a slight majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. Hindus comprise 82 percent of the population.

 A civil rights conference this weekend was named in commemoration of an uprising on a slave ship 150 years ago but is as concerned with the future as it is with the past, an organizer said. `` We've achieved great advances in expanding citizenship rights. But we still have a long ways to go in achieving educational equity and economic first-class citizenship,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Tulane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> history professor and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Amistad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. The west African tribesmen who took over the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> schooner <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amistad </LOCATION> _ ironically meaning `` Friendship'' _ won the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> legal victory for freedom for African slaves in 1841, two years after their revolt in Cuban waters. The conference is the first major event of the <ORGANIZATION> Amistad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, keeper of the nation's foremost collection of black and ethnic manuscripts and records, since it moved to <ORGANIZATION> Tulane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1987. Speakers are to include <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Labor Secretary <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and senior Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Minor </PERSON> <PERSON> Wisdom </PERSON>, who wrote landmark civil rights rulings for the 5th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in the mid-1960s. `` We thought of having some kind of family reunion, but decided there's been enough of that and what we really need to do is rededicate ourselves. ...

<TEXT>
 An army of technicians working around the clock is repairing what was once the world's largest oil refinery, heavily damaged in the war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and now playing a key role in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s reconstruction. Collapsed oil-storage tanks crumpled into rusting shapes, miles of twisted pipes, wrecked workshops, and refining equipment peppered with shrapnel holes can be seen everywhere in the 6-square-mile <LOCATION> Abadan </LOCATION> complex near the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. `` The refinery was set on fire and burned for days at the start of the war when it was shelled by the Iraqis from across the river and raided repeatedly by their planes,'' said <PERSON> Farzad </PERSON> <PERSON> Oveisi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Abadan </LOCATION>'s plant director. <PERSON> Oveisi </PERSON> boasted the refinery was partially reopened in April after a crash five-month repair program, with no foreign help. It is operating at about 40 percent capacity with 130,000 barrels produced a day, earning $ 12 million a month. About 3,000 people work at the complex that once employed 12,000. Workers are laying more than 370 miles of new pipeline and have repaired 45 storage tanks. `` We do n't need any foreign assistance. We have all the expertise necessary and our only need from abroad is specialized equipment,'' he told foreign correspondents who visited <LOCATION> Abadan </LOCATION> recently. Nonetheless, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> hotels are full of technical teams from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> working on reconstruction projects worth billions of dollars. President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> has ruled out direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement, but some West European companies with teams working on petrochemical and engineering projects are subsidiaries of specialist American firms. Before the war broke out in September 1980, <LOCATION> Abadan </LOCATION> was the biggest refinery in the world with a capacity of 630,000 barrels a day. It was knocked out in the early days of the fighting, when the Iraqis besieged the city. The refinery, within rifle range of Iraqi positions across the <LOCATION> Karoun </LOCATION> river border, was hammered repeatedly by artillery and air strikes. The restoration of <LOCATION> Abadan </LOCATION> was politically symbolic in the post-war rebuilding. But it also eased the pressure on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s five other refineries, all badly hit during the war. With a postwar reconstruction bill likely to top $ 400 billion, every dollar from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s vital oil industry counts. Oil income this year has been estimated at $ 12 billion, $ 2 billion more than projected. Oil Minister <PERSON> Gholamreza </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> estimated that oil revenue in the next five years will total $ 70 billion. On top of that, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said last month he will seek up to $ 20 billion in foreign investment in a five-year plan expected to start next spring. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s move to encourage foreign financing marks an important ideological shift in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> following the death of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> June 3 and the July 28 election of <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, leader of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s so-called pragmatists. Radicals are opposed to foreign involvement because they fear it will dilute the Islamic revolution's fundamentalist principles. The level of foreign investment <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> seeks, subject to parliamentary approval, is considered to be about the limit that is politically acceptable right now, diplomats said. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> has given top priority to the oil and gas industry, with a major expansion of the gas sector, primarily for export. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> sits on top of an estimated 700 trillion cubic meters of gas, the second-biggest reserves in the world after the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> said last month the government will invest $ 13.4 billion in foreign currency in the oil and gas sectors in the next five years. Several new refineries and major petrochemical plants are planned.

 Searchers picked through the rubble of a suburban <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> apartment complex today, looking for clues to the crash of a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> jet fighter that exploded and slammed into the buildings, leaving one man missing and feared dead. Four people were injured, including the pilot of the A-7E Corsair II who ejected just before the crash Thursday evening, and a pregnant woman and her 5-year-old child who were critically burned. `` All the people are accounted for, except one occupant,'' <ORGANIZATION> Cobb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> said today. `` Unfortunately, we're pretty sure he's in there.'' Four other people who had originally been listed as missing were accounted for today. Earlier, <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> had said, `` If there are no fatalities, I'd call it somewhat of a miracle.'' The unarmed A-7E Corsair II crashed 2 -LCB- miles short of the runway at <LOCATION> NavalAir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, 15 miles north of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> adjacent to <ORGANIZATION> Dobbins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Honore </PERSON>. The pilot was attempting to land at the air station when the crash occurred at about 6:30 p.m.. About 30 people at the <LOCATION> Pine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> Apartment complex were left homeless <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> said the missing man was believed to be the sole occupant of an apartment, but he said he could not rule out the possibility that a visitor also could have been with him. `` My first officer on the scene said he heard screams, but the building was engulfed in flames and he could n't get in,'' Police Lt. J.L. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. An initial sweep today looking for the missing man yielded nothing, <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> said at midmorning, adding, `` He's not where you can see him.'' Later, <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION> Fire Chief <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said local search crews had yielded for the time being to military searchers who were looking mainly for clues. The crash site remained sealed off with police tape and <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> guards. Police officer <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Durrance </PERSON>, who had been inside the complex, said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> jet struck the edge of a building before crashing into a car and coming to rest by a chain link fence about 30 yards away. `` It's completely burned. It's just a big piece of metal. ... The car was completely burned. You could tell it was a car, but you ca n't tell that it was a plane,'' <PERSON> Durrance </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> today identified the pilot as reservist Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conlyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON>, a veteran pilot both for the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>. He underwent brain surgery at <LOCATION> Kennestone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> on Thursday night. He was still listed in critical condition today, unconscious and breathing with the aid of a ventilator, although he showed `` some slight improvement,'' said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fredlake </PERSON>. A witness, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, said he saw the pilot's parachute deploy about 100 feet above the ground. The pilot plunged into a street, where he was given cardiopulmonary resuscitation. `` I saw the plane pop and all the lights go off,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Feather </PERSON>, a maintenance supervisor at an adjacent apartment complex who said he helped a pregnant woman and her child escape the burning building. `` I found the baby girl, and she was burnt,'' he said. `` Then I found the pregnant woman, and the paramedics showed up.'' <PERSON> Margie </PERSON> <PERSON> Padovani </PERSON>, 28, and her 5-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Jacquelyn </PERSON>, were in critical condition today with burns over about half their bodies, said <ORGANIZATION> Grady </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Driscoll </PERSON>. He said Ms. <PERSON> Padovani </PERSON> also had a broken leg. <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kraemer </PERSON>, who said he was Ms. <PERSON> Padovani </PERSON>'s fiance, said she was pregnant. He said doctors told him the fetus might not survive. <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfredson </PERSON>, 24, was treated for cracked ribs she suffered while fleeing her apartment, hospital officials said. The commander of the Naval Air Station, Capt. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, said today that he had no information on the cause of the crash. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> review board would study the wreckage and maintenance and pilot records, he said. The plane did not carry the `` black box'' flight recorder required on commercial airlines, and <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said air traffic controllers received no distress messages from the pilot. The crash confirmed the worst fears of residents who hear military planes and helicopters roar above them daily. `` I'm not surprised,'' said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Head </PERSON>, a resident of the damaged apartment complex. `` Not a week goes by that I do n't think, ` When is a jet going to crash here?''' `` What I want to know is why they do maneuvers in such a populated area?'' said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, who lives nearby. Military officials last year canceled performances by the <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> stunt aircraft because of the concentration of businesses and residences near the base. The A-7E, which entered service as the A-7 in the 1965 and was widely used in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, is a single-seat attack aircraft used for a variety of bombing missions on land and at sea. The current version has undergone a number of modifications. The A-7E has a 20mm gun and can carry payloads of up to 15,000 pounds of bombs and missiles. Two years ago, a crippled A-7D Corsair, an earlier version of the plane, slammed into the lobby of the <LOCATION> Ramada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inn-Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, killing 10 people.

 Former Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>, who sought a plain-spoken campaign against AIDS while in office, says it's a mistake for homosexuals to mix the fight against the deadly disease with the politics of the homosexual rights movement. In a health address and news conference Thursday, <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said that `` the plea for compassion and care for people with AIDS, if it gets mixed up with the homosexual rights movement, would fail.'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>, who put the condom in the front-line of the AIDS battle, declared, `` In the beginning, because AIDS was politicized, we lost precious time and lives. I hope Hispanics and blacks do n't make the same mistake.'' The leaders of both those communities, he urged, should say publicly, `` we have a number of people who, through no fault of their own, are sick and need our health care and sympathy. They should not say we should be treated differently from anyone else.'' Black ministers, <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> declared, should warn from their pulpits of the perils of unsafe sex and drugs. It was inevitable that an AIDS anti-discrimination ordinance, such as that repealed in <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION> this week, would be unpopular, said <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>. Asked whether he supported AIDS anti-discrimination legislation, he declined a direct answer, saying, `` that's a political issue, not a public health issue.'' But, he added, `` People who are sick deserve all the help and care they can get and should n't be discriminated against.''

 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> today said it was permanently lifting travel restrictions on its citizens, and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s foreign minister said workers would begin knocking holes in the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall to allow people to pass freely between the nations. Interior Minister <PERSON> Friedrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickel </PERSON> said Thursday's removal of travel restrictions was permanent. `` The new travel regulation is not a temporary measure,'' <PERSON> Dickel </PERSON> told East German television. `` It is permanent and will be the foundation of a new travel law.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> told a crowd of about 20,000 people outside <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s City Hall that holes would be made in the 9-foot-high wall, starting this evening. A portion of the wall at the famed <LOCATION> Potsdamer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Platz </LOCATION> will be torn down during the weekend, <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said. At times, his voice was drowned out by cheers from the crowd. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said he was told of the plans by East German officials. The announcements capped one of the most dramatic shifts in postwar <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, giving the once penned-up East German people freedom of travel for the first time since the Berlin Wall was built in 1961. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> first opened its borders Thursday, but until today there had been some uncertainty about the scope of the move. <PERSON> Dickel </PERSON> said police and travel authorities had been instructed to expeditiously deal with all requests for trips abroad, `` especially to the Federal Republic of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- and to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>.'' All efforts will be made to grant permission for travel or emigration the same day the request is received, <PERSON> Dickel </PERSON> said. Visas for private trips will be stamped in passports. If they do not have passports and want to leave immediately, their identity cards will be stamped, said <PERSON> Dickel </PERSON>. Tens of thousands of East Germans streamed into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and other parts of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> today after a heady night of celebrating the opening of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall and other borders. `` Last night, the Germans were the happiest people in the world,'' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Momper </PERSON> said. The party continued today, as revelers popped champagne corks, lit sparklers and embraced on both sides of the border. West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> cut short his visit to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to meet with his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> and arrived in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. He hoped to talk with East German leader <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, in a continuing effort to stop an exodus of East Germans to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, today fired four more members of the ruling Politburo and launched an investigation of `` gross mistakes'' made by the leadership under his predecessor, <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>. The Politburo, which normally has 21 members, was streamlined to 11 two days ago. It lost one more full member today and three candidate, or non-voting, members. East Germans began fleeing their Communist homeland by the tens of thousands in September, after <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> began dismantling its borders to the West and allowed East Germans to pass through. Pro-reform demonstrations began spreading across <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, finally leading to the ouster Oct. 18 of the hard-line leader <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>. The abrupt opening of the border was the breathtaking climax of a remarkable series of reforms that began with <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s appointment. East and West Berliners joined in dancing atop the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall during the celebrations that lasted through the night. More than 50,000 East Berliners crossed into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> during the night, said the West German radio station Sender Fries <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Only about 1,000 of them planned to stay, the radio said. Most were just visiting, exulting in their sudden new freedom to travel to the other side of the monolithic structure. `` The sun is shining, and the people are in a good mood,'' said a smiling, husky East German guard today at the Invalidenstrasse crossing of the wall. Many people cried as they embraced relatives they had n't seen in decades. Others rushed to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> department stores to buy cosmetics and other goods scarce in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. `` It was so simple to come over,'' one young East German said. `` The feeling is just indescribable.'' In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, jubilant West German lawmakers, many shaking with emotion, spontaneously stood to sing the national anthem Thursday during a hastily called session of the lower house of Parliament. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said if <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> makes good on its promise to allow free emigration, `` this wall built in'61 will have very little relevance.'' In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> praised the East German reforms but cautioned that any speculation about a reunified <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was `` out of the question.'' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> `` should take into account that policies aimed at reconsidering borders would not suit any government in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and would cause only mistrust,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. The sight of people dancing atop the barrier that epitomized the Cold War since it was built in 1961 was unthinkable only hours earlier. Some took hammers and chisels to the wall Thursday night in a symbolic effort to tear it down. Hundreds of West Berliners took advantage of the newly opened borders to head in the opposite direction and catch a glimpse of the other side of the divided city. `` What joy! This is the best thing that happened in 100 years!'' yelled a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> man. Many hugged and kissed strangers, while cars packed with East Germans and others paraded down the streets of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> supervised the building of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall before he became Communist Party chief. Every <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president since <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> has urged that it be torn down. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday also advocated a law that would ensure free and democratic elections in his Communist nation, which has been disrupted by pro-reform demonstrations and weakened by mass flight to the West. More than 200,000 East Germans, nearly 1.5 percent of the nation's 16.5 million people, have left so far this year _ 56,000 through <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> since Saturday alone. Most are young, skilled workers vital to the economy. Hundreds of thousands of people who stayed behind have filled the streets to demand democratic reforms and an end to 40 years of rigid one-party rule. An ADN dispatch said a party conference planned for next month would consider personnel changes in the 163-member Central Committee.

 The garden clubs in this wealthy, suburban city are banding together against what they see as an unsightly enemy: `` For Sale'' signs, which residents consider tacky. The 11 clubs have decided to embark on a letter-writing campaign to persuade real estate agents to stop using the signs, once unheard of in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> grew up and where many <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> corporate titans live. Garden club members say burglars may see the signs as hints the owners are absent. They also worry that the signs hurt property values. `` It's the effect of a fire sale,'' said <PERSON> Nadine </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Storch </PERSON>, a real estate broker and member of the Hortulus garden club. `` Everything must go. People get panicky. Why is everyone on North Street selling their house?'' One real estate agent, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogilvy </PERSON>, said his firm simply wo n't stoop to using signs `` I think signs are very ugly,'' <PERSON> Ogilvy </PERSON> said. `` I see people spending tons of money and time landscaping their yards beautifully to have it ruined by their next-door neighbor whose house is for sale for nine to 11 months and all you see is signs.'' But <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorin </PERSON>, vice president of the 700-member <ORGANIZATION> Greenwich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` In a tough real estate market, it's very difficult to tell a homeowner that he ca n't use any means available to sell.''

 Supporters of a new state policy to strengthen the teaching of evolution in the nation's largest public school system say it was diluted to please religious fundamentalists. But a minister said the new science education guidelines censored teaching of the biblical theory of the origin of life. State Superintendent of Public Instruction <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Honig </PERSON>, who helped write the guidelines, said Thursday they clearly say that evolution _ not creationism _ will be taught to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s 4.6 million public school students. `` This is a much stronger statement than was in place before,'' <PERSON> Honig </PERSON> said after the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> unanimously adopted the policy. `` This now states for the first time evolution will be taught in its entirety and it's not controversial.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Traditional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Values </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, an opponent of the policy, said it censors creationism. `` It is n't the state's role to be hostile to religion,'' <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> said. `` It is to be accommodating.'' <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> cited as particularly offensive the sentence in the policy that says: `` The particular case of ` creation science' or ` scientific creationism' has been thoroughly studied and rejected by the leading scientific societies as qualifying as a scientific explanation.'' <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>'s 9-0 vote sets up the guidelines only as recommendations to local school boards, which mandate course content. But such standards historically have influenced the local panels and textbook publishers throughout the nation. The vote climaxed months of dispute, the latest round in the long struggle between educators and civil libertarians over evolution vs. creation. <PERSON> Honig </PERSON> maintained that the changes did not weaken the evolution language, but <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> of the civil libertarian group People for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION> said the language `` leaves the door open to controversy.'' The policy `` is a 90 percent victory for science,'' he said. `` It is frustrating that the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> was compelled to weaken the evolution coverage to appease the religious right.'' <PERSON> Eugenie </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, said the policy is `` slightly weaker'' on evolution but remains a strong document overall that still says evolution is a fact. The changes, she said, were a concession to Christian fundamentalists that were necessary to gain board support for passage. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said that overall the new policy may be so much stronger on evolution that they shock teachers into ignoring the guidelines altogether. She also said some textbook publishers may withdraw from the lucrative <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> market because of the costs of reorganizing their books. Specifically, <PERSON> Honig </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Laufenberg </PERSON> made the amendments by striking a sentence that said: `` There is no scientific dispute that evolution has occurred and continues to occur; this is why evolution is regarded as a scientific fact.'' <PERSON> Honig </PERSON> said the sentence was redundant within the document. Other changes include deletion of two paragraphs that contain references to a precedent-setting <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision and a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> booklet that both question the scientific validity of the creationist theory. Several sentences were added that, in part, say `` some people reject the theory of evolution purely on the basis of religious faith,'' and that such `` personal beliefs should be respected and not demeaned.'' The old guidelines said evolution must be taught in schools, and they offered no guidance to teachers or administrators on dealing with questions from students about the biblical theory of creation.

 Sparks from a welder's torch today ignited 100,000 pounds of recycled plastics in a nearby warehouse, sending thick smoke over downtown and threatening to force the closure of an interstate highway, authorities said. Sixty workers in nearby buildings were evacuated as a precaution after the the blaze broke out in a warehouse next to Interstate 40. Deputy Fire Chief <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said authorities were concerned that the burning material might release toxic vapors, and people were warned to avoid walking into smoke. There were no reports of injuries, he said. The fire broke out about 10 a.m. and was still burning out of control an hour later, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. Welders were working on a billboard with other workers on the ground with fire extinguishers to put out any sparks that fell. Somehow, a spark ignited the plastics in the warehouse nearby, officials said. The heavy, black smoke boiled up from the blaze, blanketing downtown <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. It could be seen as far as five miles away. The <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> reported several accidents on Interstate 40, primarily because of people slowing to look at the fire. Dispatcher <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukes </PERSON> said troopers would have to close I-40 if winds blowing the smoke to the north shifted direction. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said firefighters were trying to keep the fire from spreading to nearby buildings, including a huge U-Haul warehouse across the street.

 <PERSON> Petar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON>, who was named <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief on Friday, is seen as a relative moderate whose views have at times raised the ire of hard-liners in this Communist country But in the past, <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> also spoke out against reforms demanded by <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Solidarity movement, and during a recent visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> he cautioned against countries interfering in each other's internal affairs <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> was an unexpected candidate to replace <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>, who resigned Friday after 35 years in power. Diplomats and analysts said he had upset hard-liners in the party leadership by pushing to hold an international conference in <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION>, under whose auspices independent groups were able to publicly campaign for reform. <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON>, 53, was born in 1936 in a village in northwestern <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> into a peasant's family. He studied philosophy at <ORGANIZATION> Sofia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and graduated from the prestigious <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> in 1963. He joined the ruling party a year later. A regional party secretary of the <LOCATION> Vidin </LOCATION> county in northwestern <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, he quickly made his way up through party ranks and became a Central Committee member in 1971. He was appointed a full Politburo member in 1977. <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> became foreign minister in 1971 when he was just 35, making him not only the youngest foreign minister in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> but also one of the youngest and longest serving chiefs of diplomacy in the Soviet bloc. Diplomats said Friday before the opening of a party plenum at which <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> was appointed that they expected him to be ousted from the party leadership. During last week's international conference, independent activists were joined by thousands of Bulgarians who demonstrated in <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> for reforms. <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> was conspicuously absent from the head of a delegation that met last month with Turkish officials to discuss the problem of ethnic Turks in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. Bulgarian officials cited a heart ailment that <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> reported has suffered from for years. <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON>, who toured many Western countries in his long tenure as foreign minister, including <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, was a supporter of East-West disarmament talks but cautioned against reforms demanded by Solidarity in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in 1981. During a visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that year, he told reporters that `` we want to hope that the Polish Communists and healthy forces in the country will do everything necessary'' to defend communism. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> banned the independent trade union movement and declared martial law the same year. As part of sweeping reforms that have engulfed the Soviet bloc, Solidarity was made legal this year, and a Solidarity member, <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, became prime minister. In an unmistakeable reference to the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc reforms, <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> said during a visit to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> last week that `` interference in internal affairs aimed at imposing this or that model of development in all cases leads to destabilization and poses a threat to peace and security.''

 <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> said it understood Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s decision to break off a visit Friday after the dramatic opening of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s borders, and officials tried to salvage the future of the trip. The stunning developments in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> were the main topic of talks when <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> met with Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> on Friday and said he planned to go back to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>. `` The prime minister showed understanding for the decision of the chancellor to cut short his visit,'' <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> `` wanted to do everything to create the impression that West German interest in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> had not decreased.'' `` <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> has bigger problems and everybody must understand that. It would have been politically unwise for him not to return,'' said <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Osiatynski </PERSON>, head of the central planning office. Government spokeswoman <PERSON> Malgorzata </PERSON> <PERSON> Niezabitowska </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> told <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> that he needed to break the six-day visit for `` about 24 hours'' to go to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. Making light of the events sweeping <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, a senior government official remarked, `` <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> will be back if <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> does n't reunify in the meantime.'' <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> was planning to return Saturday night and would travel to the <LOCATION> Silesian </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Krzyzowa </LOCATION> to attend a Roman Catholic Mass with <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>. Ethnic Germans also are planning to gather there. Despite the departure, the two sides managed to sign six agreements. The documents include the important investment promotion and protective agreement, which provides West German guarantees for private enterprise investments in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The economic assistance amounted to about $ 1.5 billion in two years, including a $ 250 million loan to help stabilize the zloty. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s government says massive Western economic aid is needed to secure the fragile democratic process under way. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s largest Western trading partner and <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> brought a delegation of businessmen with him to start developing projects between the two countries. On Thursday, the nations agreed to establish consulates in <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>, and to extend contacts between their foreign ministries. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Krzysztof </PERSON> <PERSON> Skubiszewski </PERSON> said his talks with West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> had been `` very good'' and all the bilateral issues had been resolved before the East German developments propelled the talks to an international level. Thousands of East Germans streamed into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> late Thursday after the decision by <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to open border crossings, and a massive and emotional street party continued through the night. Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> that the changes in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> `` should have been taken much earlier.'' `` The drama of the events in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is the result of earlier neglect, as usually happens when someone misses the train of history,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. The developments in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have fueled Polish fears about German reunification and forced long-simmering border issues to the forefront of <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s visit, which was intended to move the former World War II adversaries closer to reconciliation.

 A Soviet spokesman Friday welcomed <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s decision to throw open its borders and said it would help stem emigration and do away with `` stereotypes about the Iron Curtain. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was concerned about the instability brought on by the mass exodus of East Germans to the West. But now that travel will be easier, he said, `` The wanderlust the Germans are famous for will go down because now when you know you can go maybe you'll postpone the decision.'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> stressed that the border between <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> remained in force and the eased travel restrictions should not be taken as heralding the imminent reunification of the two Germanys. `` The border still remains, though some might think it ceased to exist,'' he said. East German Communist officials said later Friday they were permanently lifting travel restrictions on their citizens and would begin taking down a portion of the 28-year-old Berlin Wall. Now that the wall has lost its significance as a physical and symbolic barrier, `` it removes all the stereotypes about the Iron Curtain,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> also welcomed the move, saying it was `` a reasonable and sensible decision.'' The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had nothing to do with the decision to open the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall gates, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> told reporters covering his meeting with visiting Swedish Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sten </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> told <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON> that some West German leaders are making statements `` against the post-war setup and stability in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official news agency. `` The <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> are resolutely in favor of the inviolability of the European borders,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. In the first press commentary on the East German move, veteran <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> political observer <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kornilov </PERSON> called the border opening `` positive and important,'' but ridiculed speculation that reunification of the Germanys was at hand. Western claims that the borders will be redrawn in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> `` are strange postulates, in my view!'' he wrote. `` Yes, the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall has stopped being an obstacle isolating East German citizens from the Western world.'' But the move does not mean the removal of such border functions as customs inspections, he emphasized. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> cited a Nov. 1 statement by East German leader <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> that the border exists `` due to other reasons'' and not for the purpose of interfering with contacts between people. <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> noted then that the Berlin Wall marks the division between political systems as well as between the military alliances of East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said the border opening was part of the `` wide democratization of life'' taking place in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where the recent replacement of hard-line Communist leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> touched off a popular rush toward reform. East Berliners streamed into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> opened its borders. Thousands of East Germans also crossed into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Soviet TV, in its nightly news broadcast `` Vremya,'' showed people cheering as they left <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> at several border points, including Checkpoint <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> at the Berlin Wall. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said he was undisturbed by the tens of thousands of East Germans fleeing westward. `` It's not abnormal for people to leave their countries. Sometimes they return,'' he said. `` Twenty thousand people leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> every year. That in itself is not unusual.'' In fact, officials say more than 100,000 people, mainly Jews, Armenians and ethnic Germans, have emigrated from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> this year and some 2 million gone on visits in an outflow made possible by eased emigration restrictions. However, emigration is still limited by a variety of restrictions and complications, as well as would-be emigres' difficulties in finding promising countries willing to accept them A bill before the Soviet legislature would grant most citizens the right to come and go as they please but it would still require an invitation from abroad for people who want to emigrate.

<HEAD>Chinese Dissidents Welcome Deng's Resignation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Chinese who fled their country after the June crackdown on the pro-democracy movement said Friday that international disgrace forced <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> to resign. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, 85, gave up the chairmanship of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday and was replaced by his chosen successor and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON> `` The resignation of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> appears to us ... as the necessary result of the June 4 massacre,'' the Paris-based <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> said in a statement issued Friday. The federation founded by exiled Chinese dissidents said <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s resignation proved the government is unstable, though he is believed to retain a dominant political role `` In the face of criticism from the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people, from the people of the whole world and from democratic governments, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> understood he could no longer remain head of the military commission,'' the statement said. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> met former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on Friday, reinforcing the general feeling that <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> remains a powerful figure. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, Japanese government officials said <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s resignation will cause little change in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s domestic and international policies. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Taro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakayama </PERSON> and Finance Minister <PERSON> Ryutaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashimoto </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> wo n't change its policy before <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s new leaders articulate their positions. `` The important thing is that we should maintain our stand not to isolate <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' Chief Cabinet Secretary <PERSON> Mayumi </PERSON> <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON> told a news conference.

<HEAD>Bush Proposes $4.2 Billion Program to Help Poor with Housing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today proposed a $ 4.2 billion package to help the poor buy houses and the homeless receive shelter, and vowed to `` change the destructive practices'' that have blocked affordable housing in inner cities. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not suggest ways to pay the federal share of the three-year program, which would begin in the fiscal year starting next October. He announced the package, called Home Ownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere and entailing federal programs tied to state and local matching funds, in a speech for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>. It would include $ 2.1 billion in grants to help residents of low-income housing buy their units. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed a 50-percent match of federal funds by state and local governments or non-profit organizations. The grants would be used to rehabilitate and purchase units in public housing, vacant and foreclosed properties held by the government and `` distressed'' properties cited by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also offered incentives to local communities that remove bureaucratic barriers blocking the availability of affordable housing, such as zoning restrictions. He would give $ 210 million in insurance and rental rehabilitation grants for zones that best develop plans to remove such tax and regulatory barriers in inner city areas. `` We will change the destructive practices which have kept <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> out of the inner cities and distressed communities that most need its support,'' he said. He assigned Housing and Urban Development Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> to name a panel that would recommend ways to remove barriers to affordable housing. `` No city, state or town should receive a single penny of HOPE funding until they have identified the barriers to affordable housing in their own back yard and start taking steps to remove them,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He said the centerpiece of his HOPE plan was `` to recapture the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream of home ownership for those who have been left behind.'' He also proposed: _ $ 728 million in federal housing funds, to be matched at the state and local level, for new housing and support services for the homeless. _ $ 1.08 billion to help tenant groups buy and convert federally subsidized buildings to resident-owned cooperatives. _ Allowing first-time buyers to use Individual Retirement Accounts for a home down payment without paying a penalty. _ $ 44 million for a demonstration project that would offer housing and support services for elderly people who otherwise would have to be institutionalized. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials said the state and local matching funds would add $ 1.7 billion in assistance. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also was attending a dinner to help <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> retire $ 2 million in debt from his 1986 campaign and helping dedicate a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> memorial to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans before flying home Saturday. In a speech last March 14, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` When you look out the window of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and see the ragged, pathetic figures huddled over the steam grates of the Ellipse, I see an affront to the American dream, a national shame.'' He ordered <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> then to come up with new ideas to get the homeless off the streets of urban <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Earlier in the year, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed spending $ 644 million in fiscal 1990 to carry out the McKinney Act, a program created to find housing for the homeless. President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was often criticized by homeless activists for not seeking more funds for the homeless. Federal funds for low-income housing were cut 75 percent during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> officials believe there are 8,000 to 10,000 people living on the streets of the nation's capital. Nationally, some researchers estimate 300,000 to 600,000 Americans are homeless on any given night. Some activists say the homeless number 2 million or more. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> has been enveloped in an influence-peddling scandal left over from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years and <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> has devoted most of his energy to date to straightening out his department's procedures for dispensing grants and contracts.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> Friday reiterated the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> release this week of $ 567 million in frozen Iranian assets wo n't affect the status of Americans held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> television reported <PERSON> Eftekhar </PERSON> <PERSON> Jahroomi </PERSON>, legal adviser to Iranian President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, rejected any link because the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision Monday complied with a U.S.-Iranian claims commission in the Hague set up in 1981 after talks in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. `` The payment was solely in line with the <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> agreements,'' <PERSON> Jahroomi </PERSON> was quoted as saying by the broadcast, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s claims against American banks were similarly paid.'' <PERSON> Nowbari </PERSON> <PERSON> Heirani </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s representative at the international court also said the released assets `` have nothing to do with the hostages,'' the report said.

The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the decision itself was not influenced by the hostage issue. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, leader of the so-called pragmatists in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, told a news conference last month <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would help secure the release of the 18 Western hostages held by pro-Iranian groups in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> if <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> unblocks Iranian assets. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claims the assets frozen a decade ago are as much as $ 12 billion, including the value of weapons purchased before the 1979 Islamic revolution but never delivered. The assets were blocked after militants stormed the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> Nov. 4, 1979, and held American diplomats and other personnel hostage.

 Old soldiers worry about being turned out to the street. A program intended to help homeless veterans allegedly milked them instead. And the state says it has no money to stop the battleship USS Massachusetts from turning into a rust bucket. This Veterans Day, it's tough being a vet in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. The problems relate one way or another to money in a state facing a projected $ 730 million budget deficit. `` They say Veterans Day is to really honor the veterans and the deceased veterans,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>, 66, who served as an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> staff sergeant in World War II and now lives at the <ORGANIZATION> Chelsea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soldiers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION>. But, he added, `` what they're doing to us here is not even in the ballpark of the word ` honor.''' State figures estimate <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> is home to 666,000 military veterans, including 170,000 from the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War era, 121,000 who served during the Korean War, 259,000 from World War II and about 3,000 who served in World War I. About 500 of them live at the state home for wartime veterans, which opened in 1882 and is believed to be the first such institution in the country. Since July, Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' administration has announced $ 1,435,000 in cuts from the home's $ 16.4 million budget, but the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> has moved to restore the money. The budget reduction threatens the home with severe cutbacks Jan. 1 in its medical services, and some residents read this as an omen that it will be shut down altogether, said <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>, who heads the residents' council. <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> moved to the home in 1985 when two heart attacks compelled his retirement at age 62. `` My feeling is the same as practically every other veteran in the place,'' he said. `` We do not have anywhere to go if they close this home.'' Similar budget cuts are threatened for the Soldiers Home in <LOCATION> Holyoke </LOCATION> and its 262 residents. Another casualty of the money shortage is the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, berthed in <LOCATION> Fall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and operated as a state memorial by a private charitable committee. The World War II battleship was to be towed to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> this weekend for $ 6 million in repairs, but the project was aborted last week after state money was withdrawn. In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, something is apparently rotten in the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Project. Two officials of the federally financed, state-run project were suspended without pay last month while the attorney general's office looks into allegations they charged illegally high rents and accepted finder's fees from landlords <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudner </PERSON>, state deputy commissioner for veterans services, whose agency sponsors the project, acknowledged in an interview this week, `` There are a lot of people who are embarrassed about the thing.'' In any event, he said, `` I feel comfortable that there has been no diminishment of the services.'' At the soldiers' home, 101-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Alma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bloom </ORGANIZATION> explained the need for such services from the perspective of a World War I <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> nurse who joined the home's staff in 1948 and became a resident about 10 years ago. `` Veterans deserve good care,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> said. While she sympathizes with the need to save money, she said, `` veterans should come first.'' Her daughter, a 69-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> retiree also named <PERSON> Alma </PERSON> and part of a lineage of veterans going back to the American Revolution, was more direct. `` We're no different than the blind or the abused children and other services that deserve not to be cut,'' Miss <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> said. `` Take a look out there,'' Miss <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> said, nodding toward her fellow residents. `` People with their legs cut off, in wheelchairs, shuffling along with canes.''

 Dozens of mourners filed past the flower-covered coffin of <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> in the famed La Scala theater on Friday, and the pianist was buried in the family chapel of the late maestro <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Toscanini </PERSON>. <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>, who died Sunday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> at the age of 85, had hoped to attend the opening of the opera season Dec. 7 at La Scala. `` He had promised me he would come to <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> to attend <PERSON> Vepri </PERSON> <PERSON> Siciliani </PERSON> on the gala night,'' said <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Badini </PERSON>, superintendent of the theater. `` On the occasion we could have obtained his promise to perform a concert at La Scala.''

<HEAD>Federal Judge OKs Agreement to Sell Impounded Rifles to Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A court-approved agreement permits a gun dealer to sell to police officers a $ 1.7 million shipment of semiautomatic rifles impounded under a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration ban nine months ago. <ORGANIZATION> Gun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s shipment of 1,252 Steyr AUG-SA semiautomatic rifles was seized by Customs at the <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> airport in March, leading to one of the first court challenges to the government moratorium on imports of such weapons. Under the agreement approved Thursday by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Acker </PERSON>, the dealer can sell the impounded rifles, plus 3,000 more Steyrs awaiting shipment <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, but the sales can be made only to officers or law enforcement agencies. The dealer had planned to sell them to hunters. `` I'm glad it's all over. Our legal bill is astronomical,'' said Gun South owner <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>. He said Friday the rifles sell for $ 1,375 each. He said he can not order more of the rifles because of the ban, which remains on the books. The agreement cancels a Nov. 21 trial of Gun South's lawsuit challenging the ban. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barton </PERSON>, a lawyer for Gun South, said he is convinced the <LOCATION> Trussville </LOCATION> company has the right under law to import freely any number of <ORGANIZATION> Steyr </ORGANIZATION> rifles and sell them to anyone, but the financial burden required a settlement. Gun South, sole <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> importer and distributor of <LOCATION> Steyrs </LOCATION>, ordered and committed to pay for the two shipments months before the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration announced a temporary ban on imports of semiautomatic rifles in March. The ban came in response to public outcry over use of assault rifles in crimes, including the shooting at a school in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in January. The Customs Service impounded the first Gun South shipment at the airport before <ORGANIZATION> Gun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> could pick it up, and the company went to court seeking an order to release the guns. Gun South argued the gun was not an assault rifle and had received government approval for importation previously as suitable for hunting.

<HEAD>Soviet Spokesman Blasts Pentagon `Scandal' on Lasers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A government spokesman Friday accused <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials of trying to spoil superpower relations by charging that Soviet ships in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> shot lasers at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aircraft. `` Right-wing forces in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are seeking to poison the atmosphere of the two countries' relations by fanning up some insignificant scandal,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>. He told a news briefing the scandal was timed to sour President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s summit with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> next month on ships in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said Thursday the Soviets were suspected of shooting lasers at four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aircraft in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> in recent weeks, damaging the eyesight of an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> crewman in one incident. Lasers are sometimes used as rangefinders to target enemy aircraft. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said the actions occurred despite an agreement last summer by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet military officials designed to avoid such dangerous military encounters. The agreement is not due to go into effect until Jan. 1. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources said it had not been officially determined that lasers had been used, but that they were suspected because of past incidents and accounts from American military personnel. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said `` nothing actually happened, but even if something happened, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> people could have obtained necessary clarification through regular channels.'' The afflicted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crewman _ a loadmaster aboard an HC-130 aircraft _ suffered disruption of his color vision, headaches and other visual problems and is under medical evaluation, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> sources said. The crewman had been wearing `` laser eye protection'' gear at the time, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are also investigating why the damage could occur despite that equipment, the sources said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Castro </ORGANIZATION> extremist <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> is tired of jail and will give up his fight against government efforts to deport him, relatives said. `` He does n't want to prolong the anguish, after two years of this,'' said <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Adriana </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> has 50 days to appeal a judge's ruling Wednesday that upheld the government decision to deport him. But if he notifies the government in writing that he wo n't appeal, he could be deported as soon as the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> can find a country to accept him. `` He feels that to appeal would be giving his approval to the judicial limbo in which he has been kept,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>'s attorneys say they'll give him some time to reconsider before notifying the government that he wo n't appeal. <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>, 63, has been at the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> since Feb. 16, 1988, when he flew to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. He spent 11 years in Venezuelan prisons on charges he masterminded the bombing of a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> jetliner in 1976 that killed 73 people. <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> never was convicted of those charges, but the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General office maintained that his anti-Castro activities make him a threat to national security.

A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman refused to comment, other than to restate the government's promise not to send <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, where a death sentence awaits him.

 Surprising numbers that turned up in verifying the vote count for <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> mayor cast doubt on results of a bitter election won by an opponent of court-ordered housing desegregation, officials said Friday. With five of the city's 12 wards recounted in the official canvass, Democratic incumbent <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasicsko </PERSON> had picked up 1,663 votes, cutting by more than a third the margin by which he trailed Republican <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Spallone </PERSON>. `` This makes it close and there is a possibility the results could change,'' said <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Oldi </PERSON>, one of two <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> elections commissioners. The canvass was suspended Friday for Veterans Day and was to resume Monday. Commissioner <PERSON> Antonia </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Apice </PERSON> said the error discovered Thursday was unnerving because of its size, but that she considered a reversal unlikely. <PERSON> Wasicsko </PERSON> acknowledged the chance was remote, but obtained a court order to have the remaining machines impounded under state police guard. `` The whole direction of the city hangs in the balance,'' the mayor said. The race for City Hall was a pivotal one for <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>, a city of 195,000 on the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where a court-ordered housing desegregation plan has divided the city for years. The election was basically a referendum on the issue, with <PERSON> Spallone </PERSON> urging continued defiance and <PERSON> Wasicsko </PERSON> calling for compliance. In addition, the mayor will be the seventh vote on a <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> that apparently shapes up as evenly divided on the issue. `` There's always a possibility I might wake up and not be mayor of <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>. But I think the numbers will hold,'' <PERSON> Spallone </PERSON> said. `` Everything's in the hands of the Lord.'' Unofficial Election Night tallies had <PERSON> Spallone </PERSON> defeating <PERSON> Wasicsko </PERSON> by 4,466 votes, 29,025 to 24,559. Vote totals generally change slightly in the official canvass that verifies the voting machine tallies phoned in from the polling places Tuesday night.

<HEAD>Study Indicates Radiation Not Linked to Childhood Leukemia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Increases in leukemia among young people living near nuclear plants are not caused by exposure to radiation, said a study released Friday. Researchers found that death rates from leukemia and <PERSON> Hodgkin </PERSON>'s disease among young people were about as high in areas that were only considered for nuclear plants as in areas that actually contained nuclear plants <PERSON> Hodgkin </PERSON>'s disease is a cancer of the lymph glands. Researchers said it has never been linked to radiation exposure. The cause of heightened cancer rates found in the study remains a mystery. But the researchers said their findings indicate an increased risk of leukemia is not associated with exposure to radiation, with the possible exception of the <LOCATION> Sellafield </LOCATION> nuclear reprocessing plant on <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s northwest coast. The Sellafield plant has been plagued by radioactive leaks. Government studies have found a 10-fold increase in childhood leukemia a mile from the plant, and concluded the plant is linked to the disease. In the study released Friday, researchers from the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> said the new findings suggest that areas near existing and potential nuclear sites might share `` unrecognized risk factors other than environmental radiation pollution.'' Dr. <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Darby </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> said the findings point to something possibly `` in the lifestyle of the young but at the present time we do n't have a great deal of handle on it.'' The researchers investigated death statistics in 400 districts of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> near existing or potential nuclear sites. The results were published in the The Lancet, a weekly medical journal. `` Excess mortality due to leukemia and <PERSON> Hodgkin </PERSON>'s disease in young people who lived near potential sites was similar to that in young people who lived near existing sites,'' researchers wrote. Ms. <PERSON> Darby </PERSON> said: `` There was a 16 percent increase in childhood leukemia mortality in areas near nuclear installations compared with the rest of the country after adjusting for factors such as urban-rural status. When the same analysis was carried out for areas near potential installations, there was a 14 percent increase.'' `` We carried out this study because estimates of radiation received by children living near nuclear installations are extremely low, and it has been suggested that increases in the number of deaths are not caused by the presence of the installations, but by some other feature of the districts in which they tend to be built,'' she said. The new findings on leukemia bolster this hypothesis, the researchers wrote. Other previous theories, such as those involving exposure to radon gas or viruses, could not account for all the excess cancers in young people, they said. Ms. <PERSON> Darby </PERSON> said the study also would disprove stress or psychosomatic illness being a possible cause since most people living around the potential sites `` would n't have been worried about it.'' She said the main theory that needs investigation is `` that people who are exposed less frequently to infection very early in life are at a slightly higher risk of leukemia later on.'' <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Greaves </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Leukemia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, who originated the theory, `` has biological reasons for thinking that is the case,'' she said. `` Our data support that,'' she said, explaining that areas with a higher proportion of people in the upper social classes had a slightly higher risk of leukemia than people in areas with a higher proportion of manual workers.

<HEAD>Dream of Embracing West Germans May Be Nightmare For Bonn</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For decades, politicians in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> dreamed of embracing East Germans in the free West. Now, Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> has rushed back from <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> to consider whether the flood of humanity could turn the dream into a nightmare. In one of the most dramatic shifts in postwar <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the Communist East German government has thrown open the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall and also let people cross through the heavily fortified borders into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The joy of those who came through by foot and car and even on sleek skateboards only temporarily deflected attention from a suddenly volatile Central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. On the human level, there is the question of what do with the 200,000 East Germans who already have poured into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> _ to say othing of the 1 million more that some have predicted may swamp one of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s most densely populated countries. Mayor <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Momper </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> told a session of the upper house of Parliament the East German newcomers will keep causing `` large and weighty problems'' for West Germans. `` But if we never forget the suffering caused by the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, and if we keep recalling the happy faces and joy of yesterday, we can master this challenge together,'' <PERSON> Momper </PERSON> said, speaking the day after the borders were thrown open. After breaking off a politically sensitive trip to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> planned an emergency meeting of the Cabinet to map the country's strategy At issue is how to proceed both at home and in regard to the breakneck pace of changes in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. From a military standpoint, the two nations remain at the forefront of still officially hostile military alliances. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is the base for 250,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops, while nearly 400,000 Soviet troops are based in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The military element is vital to the increasingly frequent predictions the latest shifts and uncertainty in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will lead to a German reunification. Neither <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> nor <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is likely to give up completely its front-line ally any time soon, and German neutrality is a risk that many in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> are unlikely to take. Still, says conservative West German lawmaker <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lintner </PERSON>: `` Reunification is coming closer, but I ca n't say whether it will take 10, 15 or 20 years. We have the impression that things are much more concrete than we could have imagined five years ago.'' Any move toward reunification would cause unease and perhaps resistance in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and some other European countries. A reunified <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> also would mean an enormous financial sacrifice for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, as tax money from <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> flowed eastward to modernize increasingly outmoded factories and to clean up some of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s worst pollution. Perhaps as an interim measure, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> increasingly has been demanding democratic reforms in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in direct exchange for <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s financial aid, to keep East Germans from leaving in droves. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said while still in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> `` could be ready to offer significant economic aid if the will to reform manifested itself in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.'' At times, it seems that <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> talks less and less about actual reunification the more the topic goes from a nostalgic dream into the realm of serious discussion. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and his top aides also have increasingly been painting a bleak picture for the East Germans who might want to come over. It is another sign of growing stress for the government, the strapped social services and problems such as lack of housing for the newcomers. `` Every refugee must figure that he will have to live in inadequate housing for a fairly long time, and will probably be living much worse than if he had stayed home,'' Interior Minister <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON> told parliament Thursday. <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON> repeated the same warning the following day, although claiming the East Germans still are welcome.

<TEXT>
 This tobacco town now has the state's toughest ban on smoking, thanks to a pregnant woman who grew tired of having smoke blown in her face at a neighborhood grocery store `` People do n't have the right to pump poison in me,'' said attorney <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Clary </PERSON>, who voted for the controversial referendum, which passed by only 173 votes out of nearly 30,000 cast in Tuesday's election. While <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION> may not be on the scale of nearby <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION> in terms of tobacco production, it is still a tobacco stronghold. <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which makes <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> and True cigarettes, is one of the city's major employers with 2,300 workers in this town of nearly 200,000 people. `` We do n't feel like it's going to stop here,'' said <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaggers </PERSON>, a union leader at the <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> plant. `` These people -LRB- anti-smoking proponents -RRB- are going to move on to other cities and states.'' The city council could enact the ordinance within two weeks, putting smoking bans in elevators and large retail stores, and no-smoking sections in most restaurants. Otherwise, if both sides agree, the referendum would go into effect Jan. 1, to give the restaurants and other public places time to prepare. The ordinance, the toughest in any <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> city, requires restaurants seating 50 or more to set aside at least 25 percent of their seats for non-smokers. `` It seems like a painful pill to swallow until everything gets worked out,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudgins </PERSON>, spokesman for the group which pushed the referendum. `` We're not saying, ` Do n't smoke,' `` he said Friday. `` We're saying, ` Do n't expect me to have to breathe your smoke.' <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Faley </PERSON> is credited with starting the referendum after she could do nothing about shoppers smoking in the check-out line at her neighborhood supermarket. Mrs. <PERSON> Faley </PERSON>, who has since moved to <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, did not return phone calls Friday. `` She backed off from being in the forefront after she received some threats and comments,'' <PERSON> Hudgins </PERSON> explained. `` I've received some threats, too. `` It took someone with courage to speak out,'' <PERSON> Hudgins </PERSON> said. Prior to the vote, she told a local newspaper she was frustrated with trying to get businesses and restaurants to impose voluntary restrictions. `` I tried that almost a year and a half ago when I went to grocery stores and asked them to -LRB- impose their own bans -RRB-,'' she said. `` They just kind of looked at me funny. `` I asked some restaurants, and they said, ` We ca n't enforce it because there's no ordinance, so why do n't you get an ordinance,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Faley </PERSON> said. So Mrs. <PERSON> Faley </PERSON> and others formed GASP _ for <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION> to Alleviate Smoking Pollution. Volunteers collected 7,300 signatures calling for the referendum. The penalty for lighting up in a designated non-smoking area is $ 25 for each offense. No penalties will be imposed in the first year, however. `` There's so many families for which tobacco is their livelihood,'' said <PERSON> Donnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Prago </PERSON>, the owner of the restaurant `` <PERSON> Donnie </PERSON>'s.'' `` What we need is a generation or two in which the kids do n't go into tobacco.'' With 14,000 tobacco farmers, the <LOCATION> Tar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heel </LOCATION> state produces about two-thirds of the nation's flue-cured tobacco, which is valued at $ 900 million annually. Flue-cured tobacco is used to make cigarettes, and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s cigarette makers produce 56 percent of all domestic brands. Before Tuesday's vote, an organization calling itself `` <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION> Citizens for Fairness'' mailed out 55,000 brochures to residents asking them to vote against the ordinance. The group was funded by <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> and other cigarette manufactures, according to <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Annese </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> vice president <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Spears </PERSON> became the chief spokesman for the group fighting the ban. Opponents do not plan to challenge the results of the vote, <PERSON> Spears </PERSON> said. `` I still believe a voluntary approach is the better one,'' <PERSON> Spears </PERSON> said. `` I believe restaurant owners need to have more flexibility than the ordinance mandates.'' The referendum also will help anti-smoking campaigns elsewhere, he said. `` I am sure they will try to use this as a political plum and a reason for other communities to follow suit and that sort of thing,'' he said. <PERSON> Spears </PERSON> said he had spent most of Wednesday trying to calm irate employees who felt betrayed by voters in a city where the tobacco company has always worked hard to build a reputation as a good neighbor. `` There's a feeling that the community was not supportive of them as individuals,'' <PERSON> Spears </PERSON> said. `` Generally, there's a great feeling of disappointment in the community, particularly in those segments of the community where the referendum was so overwhelmingly voted for.''

 The White House is considering a high-risk move to temporarily bypass the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation process by giving `` recess appointments'' to a number of presidential nominations. White House officials said recommendations are being prepared for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> outlining the process for such a parliamentary end-run. That the White House is even considering such a move reflects frustration by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his top aides over the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s slow pace in acting on his nominations. However, the action would be certain to further inflame already strained relations between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>. Under the Constitution, the president can temporarily sidestep the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s confirmation powers by appointing a person to fill a vacancy while the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is in recess. Those named during <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' upcoming winter break could hold their jobs through the end of 1990 without <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation Some of the 119 nominations now pending before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> have been controversial. For instance, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cason </PERSON> for a top <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> post has drawn fierce opposition from environmentalists and many senators for what they allege to be a pro-development bias. The nomination of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> _ a cousin to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ to be a federal appeals judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> has been snarled in a nepotism charge. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> is now a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> district judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Stello </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s nomination as assistant secretary of energy for defense programs has been stalled since July over criticism of his record at the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Some ambassadorial appointments have been blocked by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats who claim they have few qualifications other than large contributions to Republican campaigns. Also among the pending nominations are <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> as head of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Everitt </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> as director of the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clymer </PERSON> as urban mass transportation administrator, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON> as assistant secretary of commerce and a host of ambassadorial and judicial appointments. A recess appointment might come back to haunt the officeholder when the grace period expired. And there are other ways that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can make its will felt. `` If the recess appointee wanted to get paid, it might be a problem,'' said an official in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> parliamentarian's office, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Federal law requires <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to formally resubmit nominations of any recess appointments once a new session of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> begins in order for the official to get his or her paycheck. <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON>, White House personnel director, said Thursday he is preparing recommendations for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the possible use of recess appointments this year. `` I've done it on my own, without direction of the president or the chief of staff -LRB- <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON>. However, he added, `` I've not been told to stop.'' Another White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said: `` We're not anxious to do this. This is only a last resort. But it is something we may be compelled to do.'' At a news conference Tuesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who often has vented his frustration at the slow pace of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> consideration of his nominees, accused the Democratic-led <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of `` blocking everything I do.'' Meanwhile, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> repeatedly has accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of foot-dragging on other key government positions. He told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> recently that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had failed to `` make nominations for nearly half'' of the key executive branch jobs and that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s criticism of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> inaction was `` unfounded and unfair.'' Another controversial judicial nomination involves <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, who is no relation to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> is being questioned because of his past membership in a private club that long barred blacks from joining and still refuses to admit women. <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> has been nominated for a federal district judge in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` Frankly, I'm concerned that he was too slow to grasp the significance of his membership,'' Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hearing Thursday. `` I still wonder whether he resigned because he believed his club membership was wrong or because he sought to curry favor with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> told the panel the proceedings have made him `` more sensitive now than I was about the need for a federal judge to conduct the courtrooms of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in a way to insure fairness.'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> resigned his 15-year membership in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in a Feb. 15 letter

<HEAD>Feds Finish Counting Cocaine Bags Hidden in Lye Strong Enough to
Eat Concrete</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KILEY ARMSTRONG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After a week of sifting through barrels of lye in a warehouse, federal drug agents announced Friday they had turned up 10,648 pounds of cocaine _ one of the largest seizures in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. The cocaine _ valued at nearly $ 852 million, or $ 80,000 a pound _ was wrapped in plastic and topped with 6 inches of powder that turned out to be a 98 percent concentration of sodium hydroxide, an extremely caustic lye. To extricate the cocaine, scores of law enforcers wore `` moon suits'' _ oxygen masks, 40-pound air tanks, and protective suits, the sleeves sealed with tape to two pairs of gloves. The gloves had to be changed twice an hour because the lye ate through them that quickly. Sodium hydroxide at that concentration can eat through concrete; it is nearly 25 times more concentrated than household drain cleaner. The cocaine was discovered Nov. 3 during a raid on the three-story warehouse. Investigators were searching for five suspects believed linked to the <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION> drug cartel of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. Drug Enforcement Agency officials said a ship, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Senator, brought the cocaine to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> late last month; it was then trucked to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The investigation, begun by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION>, soon encompassed city and <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police, the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The teams worked around the clock, painstakingly opening the drums and decontaminating, repackaging and removing the cocaine _ except on Sunday, when <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marathon </LOCATION> participants ran past the cordoned-off site. <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said it was one of the five largest cocaine seizures in the nation's history. Customs Special Agent <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercier </PERSON> said the drug could be tainted with the lye despite its wrapping. `` We strongly suspect other smuggling has occurred using this method,'' said <PERSON> Mercier </PERSON>. `` The potential is there that cocaine on the street may have been contaminated. From a user's standpoint, how do they know they're getting cocaine that has n't been tainted?'' The chemical can irritate the skin and respiratory tract and can cause blindness. The damage is compounded when it's smoked or injected. <PERSON> Mercier </PERSON> said Thursday's rain caused `` major safety concerns'' for the workers because slight dampness, such as from rain or sweat, can activate the lye's caustic properties. Still, no injuries were reported.

 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said Friday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must react with caution to changes sweeping the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact, but the revolutionary developments `` might portend some changes'' for the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance if peaceful reforms continue. `` The opening of the -LRB- <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> -RRB- wall, it's a major event, but it's important for us to think about what comes after that,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said in an interview at the Pentagon, minutes after the East German government announced that its open-border policy would become permanent <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government must develop a long-term strategy to deal with the developments that have rocked Europeans on either side of the Iron Curtain. `` What kinds of governments will develop in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, will they be democratically elected? ... What kind of security arrangements are going to exist between those nations and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>? Do they constitute any kind of threat to the West?'' <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> asked. `` If you get non-communist governments in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, they're likely to be less of a threat than has been true in the past in the military sense, and that obviously might portend some changes on our side,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said. The secretary said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the governments of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, `` need to be cautious.'' `` We need to digest these changes. Clearly we welcome them, but we have to be little reserved about formulating major policy shifts until we have an opportunity to see what happens,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said, adding that he finds the developments in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> `` very positive. The trend's very much in the right direction.'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> has said repeatedly that he does n't see the need for any immediate changes in the force structure of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> or realignment of the alliance because of the reforms instigated in the East. East German Ambassador <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Herder </PERSON> also urged caution Friday, speaking at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't want to hide before you that these developments are very dangerous. They could lead, if they get out of control, to bigger conflicts,'' <PERSON> Herder </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Herder </PERSON> noted that East German armed forces are only a short distance away from American, British and French forces stationed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. `` By any miscalculation, they could be involved. This could lead to a conflict,'' he said. A former military commander of the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> forces, retired Gen. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, said Friday the changes in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will result in pressures to reduce the 340,000-member <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military force in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` We'll find that there will have to be withdrawals from <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, because we ca n't afford to keep our troops there,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, who served from 1979 to 1987 as <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s commander, said a partial <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> withdrawal would require the revision of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> strategy, affecting the so-called `` forward defense'' that keeps <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops on the front lines in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> should war break out. The retired general, asked as well about the possible reunification of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, said he believed `` the events so far lead us in that direction,'' but that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and many nations in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are `` very concerned'' about such a development. <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>, asked about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in the midst of the refugee influx, said he'd sent orders to Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s European commander and the top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military man in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, to provide `` whatever assistance he can'' to the West German government The defense secretary emphasized that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has said it wants preserve the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact, `` and I do n't see there's any need for us to challenge that at this point.'' He said that while he, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> all welcome the changes, `` We want the changes to occur peaceably.'' `` While we want to encourage freedom and democracy, it's the kind of change we hope will occur without violence, without a resort to force,'' he said. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said that at this point, it appears there have been no alerts called among the East European military forces, and that among the East German police, border patrol and military `` the spirit, the mood is very positive, very upbeat.''

 Excerpts of President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s speech June 26, 1963, outside City Hall in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 There are many people in the world who really do n't understand _ or say they do n't understand _ what is the great issue between the free world and the Communist world. Let them come to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. There are some who say that Communism is the wave of the future. Let them come to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. And there are some who say in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and elsewhere `` we can work with the Communists.'' Let them come to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. And there are even a few who say that it's true that Communism is an evil system but it permits us to make economic progress. Let them come to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Freedom has many difficulties and democracy is not perfect. But we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in, to prevent them from leaving us.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 While the wall is the most obvious and vivid demonstration of the failures of the Communist system, all the world can see we take no satisfaction in it, for it is, as your Mayor has said, an offense not only against history, but an offense against humanity, separating families, dividing husbands and wives and brothers and sisters and dividing a people who wish to be joined together. What is true of this city is true of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Real lasting peace in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> can never be assured as long as one German out of four is denied the elementary right of free men, and that is to make a free choice.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Freedom is indivisible and when one man is enslaved who are free? When all are free, then we can look forward to that day when this city will be joined as one and this country and this great continent of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in a peaceful and hopeful globe. When that day finally comes, as it will, the people of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> can take sober satisfaction in the fact that they were in the front lines for almost two decades. All free men, wherever they may live, are citizens of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. And therefore, as a free man, I take pride in the words `` Ich bin <PERSON> ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Berliner </PERSON>.''

<TEXT>
 Seven Holocaust survivors thanked <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> on Friday for providing a safe haven to heal their mental and physical wounds after World War II. `` If there is a heaven on this <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, it was in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> for me and many others,'' <PERSON> Seva </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheer </PERSON> of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, who survived the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bergen-Belsen </LOCATION> concentration camps, told an international conference on the role of Scandinavians in rescuing Jews during World War II. The conference drew about 150 scholars, survivors and representatives of Nordic governments to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> and included several people featured in the book `` Witnesses to the Holocaust: An Oral History.'' The book, being published next month by <ORGANIZATION> Twayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers-G.K. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and edited by <PERSON> Rhoda </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, contains the accounts of survivors, as well as liberators. Another survivor featured Friday was <PERSON> Reidar </PERSON> <PERSON> Dittmann </PERSON>, a Norwegian Lutheran who ended up in <LOCATION> Buchenwald </LOCATION> concentration camp for his activities in the Norwegian resistance movement while an <ORGANIZATION> Oslo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student. Now a college art history professor, <PERSON> Dittmann </PERSON>, 67, said <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> was the only Scandinavian country capable of providing significant relief for Jews after World War II ended. <PERSON> Sweeden </PERSON> was able to keep its economy intact due to its neutral status during the war. <PERSON> Dittmann </PERSON> says he owes his survival to Swedish Count <PERSON> Folke </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernadotte </PERSON>, who persuaded <PERSON> Heinrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Himmler </PERSON> to allow his country to take Scandinavian inmates from the camps in March 1945, two months before V-E Day. `` I weighed 92 pounds,'' <PERSON> Dittmann </PERSON> says in the book. `` If my stay in <LOCATION> Buchenwald </LOCATION> had lasted for another two months, I would n't have.'' <PERSON> Dittmann </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> rescued 38,000 Norwegians and <LOCATION> Danes </LOCATION> from concentration camps after World War II. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Baron </PERSON>, 66, of <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, who was born in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, and his wife, <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Baron </PERSON>, 61, of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> both ended up in the <LOCATION> Bergen-Belsen </LOCATION> but did n't meet until after the war when they found themselves in a Swedish hospital. Mrs. <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> credits the Swedish government for restoring her health and giving her an education. But <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> was not as kind to Jews before the war, recalled her husband. `` As it is well known, the world closed itself and refused to take in any of these would-be Jewish immigrants. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, unfortunately like most of the other Scandinavian countries and other countries in the world, was no exception. During the course of the war ... the attitude certainly changed,'' he said. `` I know that I owe my physical health, my sanity to the efforts of the Swedish government and the people,'' <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> said. `` This helped to restore us and we regained a measure of confidence in the human race.'' <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> said he came to <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> after the war, in part because of his warm feelings for people of Scandinavian descent. <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Ancer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minnetonka </LOCATION> survived the war by concealing his Jewish identity, later married his teen-age sweetheart, <PERSON> Nusia </PERSON>, who was among only a few survivors from his hometown in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Eventually they moved as refugees to <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. `` We were amazed how friendly officials and the population were. I did n't believe people could be so friendly to a bunch of strangers who could n't even communicate,'' <PERSON> Ancer </PERSON> said. `` Not only did the Swedish government help us with our every need, but also through them I got my education. `` This was like a rebirth,'' he said. Ms. <PERSON> Scheer </PERSON>, 68, experienced the same emotional healing in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, where the only things she possessed upon her arrival were the pajamas she was wearing. She recalled the delight she felt when she was taken to a store in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and given new clothes. `` I have no desire to go back to the place where I was born, but someday I would like to revisit <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> again, the place where I was reborn.'' The seventh person to echo the sentiments of thanks on Friday was <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Nisenholz </PERSON>, 64, from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>. Some 30,000 Jews were brought to <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> after the war, said <PERSON> Inga </PERSON> <PERSON> Gottfarb </PERSON>, author of `` The Fatal Oblivion,'' which is about Holocaust survivors <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and elsewhere.

 About 90 percent of eligible voters have cast ballots in a pre-independence election that appeared headed for a successful conclusion, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> said Friday, the second-last day of voting. `` The situation in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> is commendably dull,'' said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckhard </PERSON>. `` The process seems to be going extremely well.''

The five-days of balloting, whose results are expected by Wednesday, will determine a constituent assembly that will write a constitution paving the way for independence after 74 years of South African rule. No date for independence has been set, but it is expected to be early next year. Around 90 percent of the 701,483 registered voters cast ballots through Friday, <PERSON> Eckhard </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> and territorial officials said the turnout could near 100 percent by the time the balloting ends Saturday evening. As of Friday, no reports of serious political violence were reported and there were few instances of intimidation.

 Telephone callers in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburbs should be touching some new numbers Saturday, as the suburbs leave the familiar 312 area code for a new number: 708. `` In the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> metropolitan area, about 90 percent of our customers have awareness of the change,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>. `` Outside the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area that number is probably less. `` We're urging the Chicago-area people to make sure their out-of-town customers, relatives and friends know about the change,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> on Friday. The phone company is running out of prefixes _ the first three digits after the area code. The shortage is not due to population growth but to the increase in new services that require separate telephone numbers, such as Fax machines, said <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> officials. The 312 area code will remain for the city, and 708 will be applied to surrounding towns. The new area code will extend roughly from city limits north to <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, west to <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oswego </LOCATION>, east to <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and south to <LOCATION> Peotone </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Beecher </PERSON>. About 1.5 million residential lines, 750,000 business lines and 36,000 pay phones will carry the new 708 code. While <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> says the change wo n't cost customers anything now or in the future, businesses have had to deal with new business cards, stationery and notifying out-of-state associates. The change was announced two years ago, and there appeared to be little last-minute panic among businesses, officials said. `` The department has not received a great deal of alarm or concern from businesses about making the transition,'' said <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Msall </PERSON>, assistant to the director of the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>, said businesses have called the change a minor annoyance. There will be a grace period _ from Nov. 11 until Feb. 10 _ when both the old and new systems will work. Calls between the city and its suburbs will go through without use of the area codes and calls from other areas will go through to the suburbs with either the old or new code. But on Feb. 11, callers must dial `` 1'' plus the area code for calls between the 312 and 708 area-code zones. Those using the 312 code for the suburbs will be reminded by a recording asking them to call again with the new code. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> follows several other metropolitan areas forced to split from former area-code comrades for want of new prefixes. Last year, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> area all integrated new area codes. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> is on the docket for 1990.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Discussions of the possible release of the 18 Western hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> have become more active, a magazine said Friday. In a report that cited no sources, the weekly <PERSON> Ash-Shiraa </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> release of Iranian assets this week while <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s foreign minister was in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> indicated the matter was getting more attention. `` It is known that the issue of foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has been put on the front burner and developments could come up concerning the release of some of the hostages very soon,'' the magazine said in a two-paragraph story. It has made similar predictions regularly since November 1987, when it broke the story of the arms-for-hostages deal between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. None of its recent hostage reports have been accurate. Eight of the Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are Americans, including the one held longest: <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, kidnapped March 16, 1985. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> repeated on Friday that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> release this week of $ 567 million in frozen Iranian assets would not affect the status of the American hostages, most of whom are held by <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> kidnappers loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> television quoted <PERSON> Eftekhar </PERSON> <PERSON> Jahroomi </PERSON>, legal adviser to President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, as saying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action Monday merely complied with a decision of the U.S.-Iranian claims commission set up in 1981 after talks in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. `` The payment was solely in line with the <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> agreements,'' <PERSON> Jahroomi </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s claims against American banks were similarly paid.'' <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> was the main mediator in negotiations that led to the release in January 1981 of 52 Americans held hostage 444 days at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> had said the purpose of Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>'s 3-day trip to <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> was to discuss relations between the two countries. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Tuesday he hoped return of the assets would encourage <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to seek release of the hostages, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials also insisted the transfer was not related to the hostage issue. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, leader of the `` pragmatists'' who seek to end <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s isolation, told a news conference last month he would help secure freedom for the hostages if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> released all Iranian assets frozen after the embassy was stormed in 1979 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says the assets now are worth $ 12 billion, including the value of weapons purchased by the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlevi </PERSON>, who was overthrown by the Islamic revolution in February 1989.

<HEAD>Navy Denies Reports of Looting Aboard USS Iowa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman denied on Friday a published report that sailors aboard the USS Iowa took part in looting shipmates' possessions while they battled the explosion that killed 47 sailors. The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times reported in its Friday edition that it had received a letter from an officer aboard the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> who said looting occurred while the damage control efforts were going on. The officer was not identified in the Times report, but the paper also quoted a former <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> sailor, gunner's mate <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, as saying he was informed of such looting by a master at arms on the ship. `` You are correct that there was looting while the damage control efforts were ongoing on 19 April. ...'' the Times quoted the officer as writing. `` Those who did the looting were punished either at captain's mast or at special court martial,'' he added Two other sailors also have told the Times they heard while on board the ship that looting occurred, although they had not actually witnessed the thefts. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> called the assertions `` completely false.'' `` This is a rumor that has persisted since the day of the explosion,'' <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> said of the April 19 blast in the battleship's No 2 gun turret. `` There is no record whatsoever of any tampering with crew lockers. There was no one seen in the berthing area. There was nothing strewn around the crew quaters,'' <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> said. `` I am sure there are sailors aboard the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> who believe this occurred, but there is no record that such a thing ever happened.'' <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> said that while the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> included testimony about such alleged actions in its report on the explosion, such activity was never found to have taken place. As well, he said, there is no record of any court martial having been convened, and such a procedure would be a matter of public record. In its report issued Sept. 7, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> concluded that gunner's mate <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> `` most likely'' caused the explosion by inserting some type of detonator between bags of gunpowder in one of the ship's 16-inch guns Following complaints from <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s family about the report, several congressional investigations of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s report have been opened. On Thursday, the author of the report, Rear Adm. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON>, is scheduled to testify about his findings before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 East German Ambassador <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Herder </PERSON> said Friday his country would be a `` predictable partner'' of the West in maintaining peace but warned that any miscalculation in reacting to the liberalization of his homeland could lead to conflict. <PERSON> Herder </PERSON> noted that armed forces of three allies are stationed in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. `` By any miscalculation, they could be involved. This could lead to a conflict,'' he said in a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> also has troops in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, and the city itself lies more than 100 miles inside <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the East German and Soviet forces of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. `` I do n't want to hide before you that these developments are very dangerous. They could lead, if they get out of control, to bigger conflicts.'' <PERSON> Herder </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s reaction to the events in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> was `` encouraging'' and said he hoped the changes in his country would open up a new phase in relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` My country has always been in the forefront'' of efforts to maintain stability in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and intends to remain `` a predictable partner'' of the West in that effort. His government's decision to grant freedom of travel is irreversible: `` If there are still people who believe the changes are cosmetic, they are victims of an outlived era of suspicion and mistrust.'' He was asked whether he could foresee a unified <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` In my dreams, yes. But being a politician, I do n't see any prospect for a united <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Herder </PERSON> said, because East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> are `` integrated into military alliances guaranteeing a stable balance of power'' in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Asked whether the December meeting between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would decide German reunification, <PERSON> Herder </PERSON> said, `` I do n't think it's a matter to be decided by Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'' but rather a matter to be decided by the people of the two Germanies. Asked whether he could envisage a crackdown similar to that by <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities against pro-democracy demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> last June, <PERSON> Herder </PERSON> said, `` I exclude it personally and I can tell you'' the East German government is committed to `` solve all problems by political means.'' Asked whether the Berlin Wall would come down, he replied, `` We should have no illusions and not be led by euphoria.''

 Mayor <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Tullio </PERSON> stepped down Friday after nearly 24 years in office, appointing an aide to fill the remaining seven weeks of his term as he battles a rare, fatal illness. A letter delivered Friday to City Clerk <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Klemm </PERSON> said the six-term mayor has appointed <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Liebel </PERSON>, a longtime assistant, as acting mayor effective immediately. `` I told him I did not want him to do it, and he felt like he had to do it,'' Ms. <PERSON> Liebel </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` I hated to see it happen at this point when we're within six weeks of a new administration.'' <PERSON> Tullio </PERSON>, 73, suffers from amyloidosis, a rare and fatal disease that deposits proteins in the heart, kidneys and other major organs.

A `` major proportion'' of the material proof on which the verdict was based was missing from files, according to the report. <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> did not say how long the investigation might take. <PERSON> Mindszenty </PERSON> had been appointed head of the Hungarian church with the Communist government's assent, but was arrested at the end of 1948 as tension grew between the church and state.

 Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., said Friday that <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s new leader <PERSON> Petar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> was `` no democrat,'' although he might surprise the world just as <ORGANIZATION> Egon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> has in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, who has known members of the Bulgarian leadership for many years, said he met with <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> at his <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> summer palace in August. <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>, the Soviet bloc's longest-serving party leader, resigned Friday in a surprise move. But <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said he was n't surprised `` I expected this,'' the Hungarian-born lawmaker said in an interview from his <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> office. `` The Bulgarian people have always looked to the Hungarians as their role model.

 <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students refused to publish an edition of their newspaper Friday because officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> institution had forbidden them to run an advertisement on an abortion rights rally. The university's stand on the advertisement prompted swift protests from pro-choice organizations and national education groups. `` The ad was not promoting any specific service,'' said <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hente </PERSON>, a senior who serves as the paper's managing editor. `` The ad was for a pro-choice rally and was basically expressing a political viewpoint. The newspaper's foundation is freedom of expression.'' The twice-weekly <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hoya </ORGANIZATION> had first asked university officials to review the ad, but when the university was slow to respond, the paper's student board of directors voted on Wednesday to include the ad in Friday's edition. The school's dean of students, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> deGioia </PERSON>, then told newspaper officials that they could not publish the issue with the ad, and the paper's board responded by voting unanimously not to put out a paper at all. The newspaper did print up several thousand flyers explaining the decision not to publish and distributed them around campus. `` The reaction has been overwhelmingly positive,'' <PERSON> Hente </PERSON> said. `` I got to some academic buildings, and I found that some professors had already posted them on their office doors, while others were talking about it in their classes.'' The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professors </ORGANIZATION>, which was meeting on <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION>'s campus, issued a statement supporting the students' decision not to publish. The resolution was also endorsed by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colleges </ORGANIZATION>, and several other education groups. `` We are a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, Jesuit institution, and we do n't allow advertisements of condoms, abortions or things like that,'' said <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Krull </PERSON>. `` Basically it was an interpretive question between the dean of students _ the paper's publisher _ and the student editorial board.'' The rally, which will be held Sunday at the <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION>, is designed to build support for family planning and a woman's right to an abortion. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Yard </PERSON>, whose organization is sponsoring the event, chastised <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION>. `` I'm kind of horrified that any university would deny free speech,'' <PERSON> Yard </PERSON> said. `` That they are afraid to allow open diologue ... is n't a very good teaching example to a group that is there to get an education.'' <PERSON> Hente </PERSON> said that the newspaper would accept _ and try to publish _ any other advertisements submitted in the future for rallies or forums sponsored by groups like NOW. `` We're not out for publicity,'' <PERSON> Hente </PERSON> said. `` We just want to publish, but this is something we take very seriously.''

 Rain and melting snow pushed rivers over their banks, sweeping away one house and two mobile homes, collapsing part of a bridge and forcing as many as 80 people to evacuate, officials said Friday. Flood warnings remained in effect Friday along the <LOCATION> Nooksack </LOCATION> and three other rivers in northwestern <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> predicting warm weather and occasionally heavy rain in the <LOCATION> Cascade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. The worst problems were in <LOCATION> Whatcom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where the loss of a bridge over the Nooksack cut off access to about 10,000 to 11,000 people, although some could be reached overland through <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> of the county's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. Two days of warm rain melted snow on 10,775-foot <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baker </LOCATION>, filling the river's three forks. As many as 60 people were evacuated in <LOCATION> Whatcom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and fewer than two dozen left their homes in <LOCATION> Skagit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, officials said. In the <LOCATION> Glacier </LOCATION> area, 90 miles north of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, a vacation house `` collapsed into -LRB- Canyon -RRB- creek'' and two recreational mobile homes `` were pinned against some trees'' along <ORGANIZATION> Glacier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION>, said volunteer fire Capt. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Coralline </PERSON>. No one was injured, <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said. Flood warnings also were posted along the <LOCATION> Skagit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Snoqualmie </LOCATION> and Snohomish, rivers. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> 9 and 544 were closed at <LOCATION> Everson </LOCATION>, where most of the evacuations occurred. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> 542 _ called the <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baker </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> and the county's main east-west road _ was closed at <ORGANIZATION> Nugent </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corner </ORGANIZATION>, when an 80-foot section of bridge collapsed Thursday, <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said some high-bottom vehicles were able to pass through <PERSON> Everson </PERSON> for about 2 -LCB- hours early Friday before the water rose again. `` Wherever the river is, we're having problems right now,'' <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said. `` A lot of the secondary roads that would normally take up the slack are having problems, too.'' <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Salisbury </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the bridge at <ORGANIZATION> Nugent </ORGANIZATION>'s Corner had been closed several hours before the collapse and would take at least several weeks to repair. <LOCATION> Whatcom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Executive <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Zanten </PERSON> declared the county a disaster area, and state transportation officials authorized emergency funding so people and equipment could be hired as needed.

 A <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> company said Friday it will begin field trials of a plant vaccine, which could inoculate corn plants against an insect that costs <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farmers $ 500 million a year. In greenhouse tests, corn borer damage was reduced by 80 percent in plants inoculated with the naturally occuring microorganism, according to a statement released by <ORGANIZATION> Crop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Genetics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION>, Md. `` This is the first time that a plant has been able to grow its own genetically-engineered pesticide in its vascular system,'' the company said. The borer is a pest on 20 million acres of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn crop, the company said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farmers annually lose 200 million bushels of corn worth $ 500 million to the borer. `` If it proves to be effective, if it can be easily used and it is not too costly it will do <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> farmers a lot of good,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Ostlie </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> entomologist. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> lost an average of $ 107 million worth of corn to the borer from 1981 to 1983, years in which borer infestation was particularly bad, <PERSON> Ostlie </PERSON> said. The microorganism, whose scientific name is Bacillus thuringiensis, is harmless to humans and animals, making it preferable to chemical pesticides, according to the company, which specializes in developing biological pesticides. `` Our InCide vaccine is environmentally more attractive than synthetic chemical pesticides,'' said company chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>. A prototype of the vaccine was field tested in several states. A newer, more potent version was effective in greenhouse tests and is scheduled for field trials in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> next summer, the company said. The bacteria already is being used as a pesticide by being applied on corn in granular form, <PERSON> Ostlie </PERSON> said. Researchers are concerned about whether the borers would become resistant to the toxin if it goes into widespread use.

 For 45 years, the fate of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Sgt. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wibben </PERSON> was a mystery to both his family and the residents of <LOCATION> Treguier </LOCATION>, a coastal village in northwestern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The family knew <PERSON> Wibben </PERSON> had died somewhere in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> during World War II. The villagers knew an American soldier fell while liberating their town, but they never knew his name. A historian's persistence finally led to the name, jotted in the yellowed pages of a diary kept by the commander of <ORGANIZATION> Wibben </ORGANIZATION>'s regiment This week, <PERSON> Mervin </PERSON> <PERSON> Wibben </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, arrived in <LOCATION> Treguier </LOCATION>, population 3,400, at the invitation of city elders to join them in honoring his older brother. On Saturday, Armistice Day in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Wibben </ORGANIZATION> will lay a wreath at a new monument the villagers are dedicating to the man who was once their unknown soldier. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Wibben </PERSON> was 24 years old on Aug. 14, 1944, when his 15th <ORGANIZATION> Cavalry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reconnaissance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION> advanced just to the edge of <LOCATION> Treguier </LOCATION>, a village 250 miles west of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. They found the road blocked by debris, so <PERSON> Wibben </PERSON> and other soldiers left their vehicles to clear the road. <PERSON> Wibben </PERSON> was killed in a barrage of German fire. The villagers placed a simple granite marker where he died, dedicated `` to the unknown American soldier who died during the Liberation 14 August 1944.'' He was buried in Plot K, Row 7, at the American military cemetery at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Normandy </LOCATION>, along with about 4,400 other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers who died in the fighting. The Americans took the village and eventually stopped the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>' counterattack on Avranches `` All we really knew was that that we got telegram from the Army that <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> was killed in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Wibben </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday by telephone from Treguier. `` We did n't know too much more of it until <PERSON> Treguier </PERSON> contacted us to help in this ceremony,'' he said. `` He really is some kind of hero to the people here.'' The people of <PERSON> Treguier </PERSON> did not know the soldier's name until local historian <PERSON> Yvon </PERSON> <PERSON> Herve </PERSON> launched a research project about two years ago. His search eventually led him to retired Col. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwan </PERSON>, who commanded the 15th Cavalry Regiment and kept a diary listing all the men under his command who had died. <PERSON> Dwan </PERSON> showed <PERSON> Herve </PERSON> the entry for Aug. 14, 1944, and further investigation confirmed that <PERSON> Wibben </PERSON> was Treguier's unknown soldier. `` Very few people in the war kept a diary like that,'' said <PERSON> Mervin </PERSON> <PERSON> Wibben </PERSON>, a semi-retired meat processor who served with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. `` Most of them just wanted to forget about everything.'' <PERSON> Herve </PERSON> considered the puzzle fully solved in mid-September, and Treguier officials started planning a ceremony to place a bronze plaque with <ORGANIZATION> Wibben </ORGANIZATION>'s name over the old granite marker. `` Because we have learned his identity, we wanted to invite his brother,'' said <PERSON> Herve </PERSON>. `` For us, this ceremony is a symbol of our freedom.'' <PERSON> Mervin </PERSON> <PERSON> Wibben </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Jan </PERSON>, flew to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> courtesy of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday before traveling on to Treguier. They visited <PERSON> Wibben </PERSON>'s grave and will tour the area around the World War II battlefields before leaving for home Sunday. `` It really broke me up bad when <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> died,'' <PERSON> Mervin </PERSON> <PERSON> Wibben </PERSON> said. `` He was five years older than me, but we were really close. He left me his car when he volunteered for the service.'' The family, natives of <LOCATION> Yankton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, included seven brothers and four sisters. <PERSON> Mervin </PERSON> is the first to visit <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>'s grave. `` When they called, it brought back a lot of memories _ and a few tears,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> was a prince. He wanted to go fight for his country. He loved horses so much he signed up for the cavalry ... but when he got to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> it was all mechanized.'' Saturday's ceremony comes nine days before <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wibben </ORGANIZATION> would have celebrated his 70th birthday.

 Maoist guerrillas trying to disrupt local elections this weekend blew up power lines and attacked troops and civilians, and 17 people were killed, police said Friday. Among those killed in the attacks late Thursday and Friday were seven local officeholders and candidates. That raised to more than 135 the number of officials and candidates assassinated by the <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> rebels this year. The government says more than 15,000 people have been killed in political violence since the <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> launched their insurgency in 1980, and the increasing tempo of attacks have been denounced by all political parties. Thousands marched in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> Nov. 3 for peace. Police said rebels fatally shot an election board official, a town council officer and three council candidates Friday in <LOCATION> Palca </LOCATION>, 155 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. They killed a policeman and his wife Friday morning in <LOCATION> Tarma </LOCATION>, 95 miles east of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, police said. Authorities said guerrillas shot to death a town council candidate and a provincial official before dawn Friday in <LOCATION> Huanta </LOCATION>, near the Andean city of <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>. On Thursday night, <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> rebels broke into the house of the former local election board president Thursday night in <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>, fatally shot his wife and sister and set fire to the house, police said. The official, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON>, was not at home when the attack occurred. Police said rebels also shot and killed the wife of the director of a government development agency in <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> Thursday night after not finding the man at home. The guerrillas also set fire to the house. Rebels on Thursday also killed a teacher in the city 235 miles of southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> and several mountain departments, or states, have been under a 10 p.m. curfew since Sept. 18. The government on Friday extended a curfew in four states where more than 2 million people live. On Friday, rebels distributed pamphlets in <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> urging people to boycott Sunday's municipal elections, saying, `` Down with the electoral farce.'' The pamphlets also announced a three-day `` armed strike'' beginning Saturday in the department of <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>. The rebels had previously announced similar strikes for the departments of <LOCATION> Junin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pasco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Huanuco </LOCATION>, important agricultural and mining regions in the central highlands.

 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s upheaval will rattle all <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, impelling the two Germanys toward political and economic association and throwing into question the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact alliances, American experts said Friday. `` It is probably the most important strategic change since the war,'' said <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Treverton </PERSON>, senior fellow for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> at the Council on Foreign Relations. `` The center of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the Germanys, still are the most strategic landscape in the world. This change there is the most important thing to happen in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> certainly for the last 30 years,'' <PERSON> Treverton </PERSON> said in an interview. While reforms in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> initiated the process, <PERSON> Treverton </PERSON> said, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was `` the place where we've always presumed change would come last. Now we find it coming very soon, and very quickly.'' The lifting of travel restrictions and promised political reform there `` means the successful self-liberation of the German Democratic Republic, which in itself is a momentous event,'' Prof. <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said, also in a telephone interview. Moreover, in its aftershocks, `` it is likely to change the politics of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and the political climate of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, a historian specializing in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` It's an astounding historical development.'' <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said Friday it was permanently lifting travel restrictions on its citizens, and tens of thousands of East Germans streamed into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> through the newly opened <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall. Many, however, are expected to return. The events were sparked by pro-reform demonstrations across <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> _ and the flight to freedom of thousands of East Germans _ that forced the Oct. 18 ouster of hard-line leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>. His successor, <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>, swept aside the old guard in the ruling Politburo and has promised political reform, including free elections. Allied conquerors sliced <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> into the democratic West and communist East after World War II, and forces of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact, on the East, and the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, on the West, have faced each other across the two Germanys every since. Now, <PERSON> Treverton </PERSON> said, the question for the short term is whether <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will produce economic and political reforms sufficient `` to build for itself some legitimacy.'' The conundrum is that if it fails it loses all legitimacy, he said, but if it succeeds, `` then it's difficult to see what basis there is for a separate state.'' `` Then the question is whether some sort of reassociation in stages can happen and how than would be regarded by the rest of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Treverton </PERSON> said. `` It's no so much reunification as what form association of the states takes, and over what time period.'' <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> held a largely similar view: `` It sounds to me as though the East German government is trying desperately to find some stability, and that it might be able to satisfy its citizens with the promises made and the deeds committed, and then enter into negotiations with the Federal Republic -LRB- <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- for vast economic aid. `` And then you would have two German states, in the short run, in very close association. That's not yet reunification, and I could imagine that it would n't become reunification for many years.'' The response of other European states is critical, <PERSON> Treverton </PERSON> noted, because of their fear that a reunited <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would contribute to the kind of political instability that preceded the world war. `` Most of the rest of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is exhilarated and nervous in about equal proportions,'' he said. `` Nobody knows whether the nature of the European state system has changed enough that a <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> that was always destabilizing before may not be so this time around.'' With that concern, <PERSON> Treverton </PERSON> said, `` <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and probably the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact ought to stay in place a long time as a kind of residual insurance policy.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, also said there was reason for caution amid the jubilation. `` <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is not appearing to be in control of its own destiny,'' <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> said from his home in <LOCATION> Garrison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION> `` I would hope there is n't a crackdown.'' <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, however, wondered if the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION> alliance had not already largely crumbled. `` What is left of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact?'' he asked. `` Would the Soviets really be able to count on the Poles and the Hungarians, even if they could count on the East Germans, or maintain their troops there?'' One possible outcome, he suggested, was `` a breathing period'' in which the Americans, Soviets, British and French, along with the two Germanys, might reach agreements reducing their troops there. On the economic front, <PERSON> Treverton </PERSON> suggested that the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> promptly open negotiations with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the other changing Eastern European states in order to cement its position as the economic framework for the new <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, for his part, said the impact of the upheavals on <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s economy, particularly on <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s economic merger in 1992, remain to be seen. `` Nobody could have predicted what has occurred so far,'' he said. `` So it's foolhardy to make any predictions.''

<HEAD>Divided Parties Propose Their Solutions to Political Deadlock</HEAD>
<HEAD>By NIKOS KONSTANDARAS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former socialist Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> received a presidential mandate Friday to try to form a government, but all three major parties were offering conflicting solutions to end the political deadlock. Conservative leader <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> earlier Friday returned his mandate to President <PERSON> Christos </PERSON> <PERSON> Sartzetakis </PERSON> and proposed a short-term administration to tackle pressing economic problems. Underscoring the crisis, the central bank Friday ordered commercial banks to limit credit extended to the private sector because of a cash shortfall. `` There is a need for a government with international prestige... made up of personalities which will be supported by all parties,'' <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> told a news conference He said the government members should not be politicians and elections should be held early next year. The deadlock arose after <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won the most votes in last Sunday's elections but missed a majority in the 300-seat Parliament. New Democracy won 148 seats in the elections, <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> PASOK </ORGANIZATION>, took 128, and the Communist-led <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> and Progress won 21 Three seats went to independents. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, who governed from 1981 until June, proposed a long-term alliance between <LOCATION> PASOK </LOCATION>, the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, and two independents. He said now was not the time to consider <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON>' proposal for a government supported by all parties, but did not rule out such an eventuality. The leftist <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> supports the idea of a broad-based government of personalities, but its conditions for backing it include a freeze on negotiations on the future of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. If <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> fails to form a government by Monday, he will return the mandate to the president and it will be given to Coalition leader <PERSON> Harilaos </PERSON> <PERSON> Florakis </PERSON>. The last government, administered by a conservative-Communist alliance, dedicated itself only to investigating and indicting <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> and five of his former ministers on corruption charges. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, who has denied all charges, is to be tried by a special high court early next year.

 An art gallery director fighting to keep a $ 10,000 federal grant in a test of a new anti-obscenity law said Friday she fears a return to the blacklists of the 1950s. `` And I do not think blacklists are a good thing to have in this country,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON>, executive director of Artists Space in downtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. `` Last June, Artists Space sponsored an exhibition of Eastern European art. From that show, we learned a great deal about the aesthetic poverty of official vs. unofficial art,'' <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` I sincerely hope that this country is not moving in that direction.'' In a Nov. 3 letter, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON> revoked the grant for the gallery's upcoming AIDS art exhibition. He said later the exhibition catalog indicated the show was political rather than artistic in nature. Artist Space's board on Wednesday unanimously rejected the request to relinquish its claim to the grant. The board's decision `` is our way of defending the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public's right to form their own opinions on artistic expression,'' <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> said. The endowment is withholding the $ 10,000 pending a legal opinion from the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> said she had not yet obtained a lawyer and would not speculate on what actions might be taken. `` We're kind of in a crisis situation,'' she said. The show will open Nov. 16, `` exactly as we had planned,'' she said. It features works by 23 painters, sculptors and photographers that portray the effects of AIDS on the artistic community. An apparent sticking point was a catalog essay by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojnarowicz </PERSON>, a photographer who has AIDS, which assails Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dannemeyer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Calif </LOCATION>., and Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION> `` It would be extremely naive to publish a catalog with strong language and references to public figures and not expect some kind of comment or controversy,'' said <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> Still, she said, `` We did n't decide to do a catalog that was politically charged; we are publishing a catalog with artistic texts and writing.'' <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> said that although the show includes some images of male and female nudity, `` This is not a show about politics; this is not a show about sexuality; this is a show about AIDS.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised Friday to `` recapture the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream of home ownership'' for all Americans and provide shelter for the poor and homeless with a three-year, $ 4.2 billion spending package. `` The true measure of success is n't how many families we add to housing assistance rolls. It's how many families move up and out _ and into the ranks of homeowners,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said without specifying where he would find the money. The secretary of housing and urban development, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, told reporters he hoped the money would come from a cut in the capital gains tax, a proposal that has encountered vigorous opposition on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said the spending would be new money and that it was not his understanding it would come from other housing programs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, speaking to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>, outlined $ 4.2 billion in federal spending for three years starting in fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1, 1990. In addition to the $ 4.2 billion in actual spending, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said, the package will cost the government `` several billion'' dollars in revenue lost due to tax incentives, including low-income housing tax credits and penalty-free <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> withdrawals for home down payments. The program, unlike congressional housing proposals, does not provide any money for new construction of low-income housing. The financing levels in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposal are well below legislation making its way through both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, but well above anything proposed in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed $ 2.15 billion in grants to help low-income families buy units in public housing buildings, or vacant or foreclosed properties under the program _ Home Ownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere, or HOPE. However, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said the grant money would not go directly to home buyers. Most would go to local groups that rehabilitate or buy such properties and make the housing available at below-market prices. About one-third of the grant money money would be used by such groups to help poor people with mortgages, said <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s assistant, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunette </PERSON>. `` The real centerpiece of our HOPE initiative,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, is `` to recapture the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream for home ownership for those who have been left behind, through resident management and resident ownership.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION>, Housing and Urban Affairs, said in a statement: `` I welcome the spotlight that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has shone on housing'' but he argued the president's plan `` merely arranges the deck chairs on the Titanic. ... The $ 4.2 billion could be better spent building new units.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan: _ Provides $ 728 million for the homeless _ to be equally matched by states, local government or private groups _ for housing and support services such as social and mental health programs That would be above the more than $ 200 million already envisioned in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> spending under the McKinney Act to serve the homeless through a variety of federal programs. _ Allows first-time homebuyers to use their Individual Retirement Accounts for down payments without paying a penalty for withdrawal However, they would have to pay taxes on the money, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. _ Asks <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to create 50 inner-city Enterprise Zones over four years where investors would be given tax incentives for undertaking development _ Includes $ 1.075 billion for tenants to convert and rehabilitate federally subsidized housing into resident-owned cooperatives Tenant groups would have the first right to buy buildings whose owners leave the low-income housing programs. About 334,000 units would be affected by that provision in the next 15 years. _ Provides $ 210 million for insurance and rental rehabilitation grants in 50 `` housing opportunity zones. These areas would be selected on the basis of which localities best removed zoning and other bureaucratic barriers to providing affordable housing. _ Provides $ 44 million for a demonstration project to set up `` service-supported housing for the frail elderly'' that would given them both housing vouchers and assistance to pay for services they need to live independently _ Requires public housing authorities and local governments to help welfare and other low-income families with job training, child care, transportation and other assistance `` This is the first time a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> president has acknowledged that the war on poverty is not only an essential inner city strategy ... that there are pockets of poor left out of the recovery,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. In a new bid to revive his flagging proposal to cut the capital gains tax, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would tie that proposal to renewal of a low-income tax credit due to expire at the end of the year. Proponents of a reduction in taxes on capital gains contend businesses would invest the extra money in projects that ultimately would increase government revenues. Opponents, however, say the government would not recoup the lost revenue. The low-income tax credit was enacted in the 1986 Tax Reform Act to encourage the development of low-income rental housing in exhange for highly favorable tax treatment. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed renewing the credit `` as part of a package of reforms that includes a cut in the capital gains tax.'' However, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> indicated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would not hold the low-income tax credit renewal hostage to passage of the capital gains reduction. The capital gains issue was among the most contentious between the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this year. The administration agreed last week not to continue blocking other legislation by trying to attach a capital gains provision to it, at least for the rest of this year. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> would name a commission to find ways to remove bureaucratic barriers to construction and rehabilitation of affordable housing in inner cities. `` No city, state or town should receive a single penny of HOPE funding until they have identified barriers to affordable housing in their own back yard, and started taking steps to remove them,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Military Gov't Gives Visas to 1st Foreign Reporters Since Crackdown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The military government has granted the first visas to foreign reporters since it arrested opposition leaders in July and began rounding up thousands of activists supporting democratic reform. `` Foreign journalists' visas are being considered on a case-by-case basis,'' Col. <PERSON> Ye </PERSON> <PERSON> Htut </PERSON>, a government for the ruling junta, told a news conference Friday. `` Genuine journalists, who will report the truth objectively without bias, will be permitted when their credibility is vouched and guaranteed by a responsible person or organization,'' he said. A Cable News Network television crew visited <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> this month, ending a ban on foreign reporters that coincided with the military junta's crackdown on the opposition. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> has been a one-party state since Ne Win toppled the elected government in a military coup in 1962 and instituted a rigid socialist system that impoverished what had been considered one of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s most prosperous states. Ne Win resigned in July 1988 after hundreds of thousands of Burmese took to the streets to demand democracy, but armed forces chief Gen. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> seized power two months later and troops killed thousands of people in a crackdown on dissent. In January, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> officially granted visits by foreign journalists for the first time in 26 years. But the journalists were banned in July, when authorities rounded up thousands of political activists and put opposition leaders <ORGANIZATION> Aung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kyi </ORGANIZATION> and Gen. Tin Oo under house arrest. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said it has `` credible'' reports that many of those imprisoned have been tortured, some until death. The state press recently has stepped up attacks on foreign journalists, accusing them of bias and of assisting allegedly subversive groups.

 <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> ended her visit here Friday with pledges of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic support but no outward sign that she will back continued <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> use of military bases in her country. Before departing, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> breakfasted with Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and U.S.-backed Nicaraguan opposition candidate <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>. The two women _ both the wives of slain national leaders _ discussed their common experiences in entering politics, said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Carnes </PERSON> <PERSON> Lord </PERSON>. Asked if Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> hoped to cash in on some of Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s popularity, <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> said, `` That was the idea, obviously.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, accompanied by members of her Cabinet and aides, later left for <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, where she planned to resume what she has described as the main purpose of her mission to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ encouraging trade and investment needed for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>' economic recovery Before departing, she agreed during a 30-minute talk with <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> to start exploratory talks in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> in mid-December on the future of the Philippine bases, <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>, who attended the <LOCATION> Aquino-Cheney </LOCATION> meeting at a downtown hotel, told reporters, `` It all depends on the results of the exploratory talks'' whether the December meetings lead to negotiations on a new bases agreement after the existing pact expires in 1991. `` If both sides see after the talks that negotiations are worthwhile towards a new treaty, then those negotiations will begin soon afterward,'' <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> said during a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> appearance. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>, who will lead the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> talks, said there must first be exploratory meetings to determine if `` negotiations are worthwhile towards a new treaty'' _ opening the possibility that the basing arrangement might not be renewed. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and administration officials, however, have voiced optimism that the process will lead to a new agreement. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> said the exploratory talks should deal with use of the bases, jurisdiction over criminal cases and compensation. He mentioned no payment amount. In talks a year ago, <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> had demanded $ 1.2 billion worth of aid during each of the last two years of the current agreement. Negotiators finally settled on $ 480 million annually. Various opinion polls show that the Philippine public supports keeping the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s reluctance to take a stand is regarded by some <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as both a negotiating tactic and recognition of strong opposition to the bases in the Philippine <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. In his welcoming remarks Thursday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` You deserve our help and you will get it. I pledge our continuing assistance to your government, and that means security assistance as well as aid to economic development. And it means cooperating in your important debt-reduction programs.''

 Two Pakistani drug traffickers were beheaded Friday for smuggling heroin into the kingdom, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announced.

Beheading is a punishment for murderers under the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sharia </ORGANIZATION>, or religious laws, in effect in the kingdom. Thieves have their hands chopped off and adulterers are stoned to death. But in recent years, <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> theologians have prescribed beheading also for those convicted of spreading `` corruption on the face of the earth,'' and drug smuggling falls under that category. Executions usually take place in public squares outside mosques Friday, the Moslem holy day, as the faithful come out of noon prayers.

 Industrialist <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> underwent surgery Friday to have a pacemaker implanted in his heart and was reported in good condition afterward at <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. A statement from his company, <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, did not elaborate. But Hammer, 91, has a history of painful heart flutters and had been reported to be making monthly visits to his cardiologist, Dr. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tillisch </PERSON>. The surgery, performed Friday afternoon by pacemaker specialist Dr. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Guzy </PERSON>, was voluntary, <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> said late Friday afternoon. `` He is alert and talking,'' <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> said. Doctors expect him to be released from the hospital in a few days and return to normal activity, <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> said. A pacemaker regulates electrical activity in the heart so that it beats normally in a person who suffers abnormal heart rhythms. Hammer, the chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION>, is nearly as well-known for his art collecting and philanthropy as for his business acumen. He considers himself a private ambassador for world peace and has met every Soviet leader since <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>. After word of Hammer's hospitalization leaked, trading in <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> stock was suspended on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The price of <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> shares has surged in the past when Hammer has been reported to be in ill health. Analysts say the reason is that without the longtime chairman's presence, the company would become a likely takeover target Hammer was pardoned earlier this year by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for a Watergate-era crime, making illegal contributions to President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s re-election campaign in 1972. Hammer had pleaded guilty to the charges in 1976, was placed on probation for one year and fined $ 3,000. He had campaigned for a pardon ever since.

 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on Friday promised free elections, freedom of association and assembly, closer supervision of its security forces and an end to official privileges. In other moves to boost its sagging authority, the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> also sacked four officials from the ruling Politburo and launched a broad investigation of `` gross mistakes'' made under ousted party boss <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> The committee gave no precise timetable or details of the promised political reforms. But it suggested they should be adopted without delay. The party moves followed the Communist government's stunning decision to throw open the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s borders to the West for the first time since the Berlin Wall was built in 1961. They came at the end of a three-day committee meeting and closely followed similar promises made Wednesday by new party leader <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>. The committee also confirmed <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, 52, as party general secretary. Like the dramatic move to open the borders it kept shut for 28 years, the leadership's promises seemed an attempt to address the demands for more democracy made by hundreds of thousands of demonstrators in recent weeks. They are also designed to calm grass-roots party members who vented their anger at party leaders at two rallies this week, and to give the Communists a program they can try to sell to restore the party's standing. The policy-making committee approved a document that admitted `` grave mistakes'' made by <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, ousted Oct. 18, and the old Politburo that resigned en masse Wednesday `` led to a deep crisis.'' `` Radical reforms are indispensable,'' the document added. To this end, it promised: _ `` Free, general, democratic and secret elections,'' adding that the Communists support `` a democratic coalition government;'' _ More autonomy for local government and the greater separation of party and government bodies; _ New laws on freedom of assembly, association, the press and moves to restore the supremacy of law and independence of the judiciary; _ Greater openness in the media and a new law on the press; _ A parliamentary committee controlling the work of the secret police and other security organs; _ Investigation of the mistakes of the old party leaders and an end to `` undeserved privileges'' for all party officials; _ More say for the workers, more role for market forces and more orientation toward consumer goods in the economy. `` We have a great task before us, a revolution on German soil, which will bring us a socialism that is economically effective, politically democratic, -LRB- and -RRB- morally clean,'' <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> told a party rally in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Friday night. He gave no further details of the plans for free elections _ the key demand of East Germans rallying for democracy in recent weeks. The next parliamentary elections are not due until 1991, and <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> told visiting West German Social Democrat <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Rau </PERSON> on Thursday that he intended to stick to that timetable. However, some party members have demanded that elections be held next year at the latest. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said four Politburo members were expelled Friday and that two former <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> associates were removed from the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Fired Friday were full member <PERSON> Hans-Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> Boehme </PERSON> and three candidate, or non-voting, members, <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Chemnitzer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Walde </PERSON> and <PERSON> Inge </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>. <PERSON> Boehme </PERSON>, 59, had lost the support of his local party organization, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. Earlier this week, the 21-member Politburo was reduced to 11 members. The latest changes left the Politburo with 10 full and three non-voting members. The meeting also set a party conference for Dec. 15-17 to discuss personnel changes in the 163-member Central Committee. Two longtime <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> associates, <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mittag </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON>, were kicked out of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The Central Committee accused them of `` greatly damaging the reputation'' of the party and ordered a special commission to investigate their mistakes. The investigation would include other party members, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Mittag </PERSON> had been <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s economy czar and <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON> had been propaganda chief. The 10-member Politburo now is made up of: <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Eberlein </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Herger </PERSON>, <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarowinsky </PERSON>, <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON>, <PERSON> Siegfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Rauchfuss </PERSON>, <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Schabowski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuerer </PERSON>. Its three non-voting members are <PERSON> Margarete </PERSON> <PERSON> Muller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sieber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hans-Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> Willerding </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 For decades, politicians in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> dreamed of embracing East Germans in the free West. Now, Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> has rushed back from <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> to keep the flood of humanity from turning the dream into a nightmare. In one of the most dramatic shifts in postwar <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the Communist East German government has thrown open the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall and also let people cross through the heavily fortified borders into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. On Friday, in response to the flow of refugees and overwhelming criticism from the public, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> also promised free elections and greater separation of party and state The joy of those who came through by foot and car and even on skateboards only temporarily deflected attention from a suddenly volatile Central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. On the human level, there is the question of what do with the 200,000 East Germans who already have poured into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> _ to say nothing of the 1 million more that some have predicted may swamp one of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s most densely populated countries. Mayor <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Momper </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> told a session of the upper house of Parliament the East German newcomers will keep causing `` large and weighty problems'' for West Germans. `` But if we never forget the suffering caused by the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, and if we keep recalling the happy faces and joy of yesterday, we can master this challenge together,'' <PERSON> Momper </PERSON> said, speaking the day after the borders were thrown open. After breaking off a politically sensitive trip to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> planned an emergency meeting of the Cabinet Saturday to map strategy. At issue is how to proceed both at home and in regard to the breakneck pace of changes in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The chancellor told reporters the session will consider `` necessary special measures,'' without elaborating. Government sources, speaking to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> also will try to speak with new <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, <ORGANIZATION> Egon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, by telephone within the next few few days. From a military standpoint, the two nations remain at the forefront of still officially hostile military alliances. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is the base for 250,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops, while nearly 400,000 Soviet troops are based in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The military element is vital to the increasingly frequent predictions the latest shifts and uncertainty in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will lead to a German reunification. Neither <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> nor <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is likely to give up completely its front-line ally any time soon, and German neutrality is a risk that many in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> are unlikely to take. Still, says conservative West German lawmaker <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lintner </PERSON>: `` Reunification is coming closer, but I ca n't say whether it will take 10, 15 or 20 years. We have the impression that things are much more concrete than we could have imagined five years ago.'' Any move toward reunification would cause unease and perhaps resistance in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and some other European countries. A reunified <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> also would mean an enormous financial sacrifice for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, as tax money from <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> flowed eastward to modernize increasingly outmoded factories and to clean up some of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s worst pollution. Perhaps as an interim measure, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> increasingly has been demanding democratic reforms in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in direct exchange for <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s financial aid, to keep East Germans from leaving in droves. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said while still in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> `` could be ready to offer significant economic aid if the will to reform manifested itself in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.'' At times, it seems that as <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> talks less and less about actual reunification the more the topic goes from a nostalgic dream into the realm of serious discussion. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and his top aides also have increasingly been painting a bleak picture for the East Germans who might want to come over. It is another sign of growing stress for the government, the strapped social services and problems such as lack of housing for the newcomers. `` Every refugee must figure that he will have to live in inadequate housing for a fairly long time, and will probably be living much worse than if he had stayed home,'' Interior Minister <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON> told parliament Thursday. <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON> repeated the same warning the following day, although claiming the East Germans still are welcome.

 A brush fire stopped short of an affluent development above <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palisades </LOCATION> on Friday because homeowners had cleared away brush and water-dropping helicopters acted quickly, officials said. The morning blaze charred nearly 90 acres of chapparal in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ynez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION> in hot, dry weather. Within two hours, four other brush fires also were reported in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, including a 200-acre blaze that briefly threatened ranches outside of <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION>, 50 miles north of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. All of the fires were contained within hours and no injuries or property damage were reported, authorities said. The other wildfires burned 30 acres in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Susana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, 15 acres near Diamond Bar along the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION> line, and one acre in <LOCATION> Rowland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, about 20 miles east of downtown, officials said. The Palisades fire quickly raged into highlands from <LOCATION> Sunset </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> toward the development known as the <LOCATION> Palisades </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highlands </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON>. Five helicopters operated by city and county fire crews helped slow the fire, moving like mud wasps between flames leaping 40 feet high and the nearby <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ynez </LOCATION> reservoir. Twenty-nine engine companies assisted from the ground. `` The fire department has been on our tails to keep the brush cleared and that's what's saved us,'' said <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haves </PERSON>, board chairman for 15 homeowners' associations in <LOCATION> Palisades </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highlands </LOCATION>. The dense chaparral canyons of Topanga State Park surround the <LOCATION> Palisades </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highlands </LOCATION> community. The Spanish-style development nestled in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> consists of 1,200 condominiums and homes valued from $ 400,000 to $ 4 million. lanc - 50 mileas north downtown Ash fell like a light snowfall over the community, but <PERSON> Haves </PERSON> said there were no wooden shingle roofs in the area, another factor that helped stymie He added that the fast response by helicopters was pivotal. `` They just doused it,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Palisades </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highlands </LOCATION> are just inland from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palisades </LOCATION>, in the foothills of the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> east of <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s government and the U.S.-backed Contras made progress in their talks on a cease-fire, amnesty and disbanding of the rebels, officials said Friday. The parties will meet again next week. The talks recessed in the midst of discussing the toughest issue, whether the Contras would commit to a timetable for disbanding as part of a package deal including a cease-fire and amnesty. `` We are negotiating now our return to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in accord with the <LOCATION> Tela </LOCATION> agreement, and we are ready to go back once there is a meeting of minds between the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and our side,'' said <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, the Contra military commander and chief negotiator. The agreeement, signed in <LOCATION> Tela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, by the five Central American presidents last Aug. 7, calls for disbanding of the Contras by Dec. 5. `` We are negotiating; in that sense it is positive. It is negative in the sense that we could not achieve a cease-fire. There is a war in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>. The chief Nicaraguan negotiator, Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON>, said, `` I think we were able to find some coincidence -LRB- of views -RRB-, and next week in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> we are going to continue those discussions, and we hope we will able to get a sound agreement that will incorporate the demobilization and the cease-fire.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> said the talks will resume Monday at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION>. The talks are being jointly mediated by the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. Diplomats said privately that the Contra delegation wanted to confer over the weekend with a new rebel leadership commission that was announced this week. <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> confirmed the Contras were still discussing the details of demobilizing. Earlier, he said headway was being made on the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> insistence on an agreement for the Contras to disband, and on rebel demands for an amnesty and truce. <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> has not rejected the Dec. 5 deadline or the concept of demobilization in the <LOCATION> Tela </LOCATION> accords, which the Contras did not sign, said a source close to the talks, speaking on condition of anonymity. The leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and Contras are close to agreement on a cease-fire, but the government wants the truce to be part of a pact to disband the Contras, said the source. Despite tough talk, both sides appeared committed to reaching agreement on ending an 8-year-old war that has cost an estimated 12,000 lives. One new element of uncertainty is whether all Contra field commanders will abide by any agreement reached at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. This week, a new rebel civilian-military commission was announced. The leader of the new commission, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Galeano </LOCATION>, said in a letter to Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> released Friday, `` It would be foolish to voluntarily hand over our weapons before free elections are held'' Feb. 25. The new commission still authorizes <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> to negotiate on its behalf. The Nicaraguan negotiators recognize the new commission. When the first direct talks in more than a year began Thursday, the U.S.-backed rebels said they would not disband until the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> granted amnesty and renewed the cease-fire President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> canceled last week. Government negotiators said <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> would not reinstate the truce nor grant amnesty until the Contras agreed to demobilize. The agreement <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and the presidents of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> signed at <LOCATION> Tela </LOCATION> requires that the Contras be disbanded by Dec. 5 and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> hold free elections by Feb. 25. Asked if an agreement was possible, <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> replied: `` Anything is possible with political will.'' In <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, government and rebels accused each other Friday of launching recent attacks.

<HEAD>State and Federal Workers Investigate Outbreak of Rare Illness</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal and state health officials on Friday worked to discover what caused an outbreak of a rare and sometimes fatal blood disorder. Thirty-one cases had been reported by Friday in six widely scattered states, including 21 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, as health authorities sought to determine if the outbreak was linked to the use of L-Tryptophan, an amino acid dietary supplement. The disease, eosinophilia, is characterized by high counts of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell. Symptoms may include sharp muscular pain, fatigue, fever and rashes. Dr. <PERSON> Millicent </PERSON> <PERSON> Eidson </PERSON>, environmental epidemiologist with the state <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said 21 cases of eosinophilia have been confirmed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, and an additional case involving a nearby <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> resident was reported. <PERSON> Eidson </PERSON> said 16 of the 17 women patients and one of the five men had taken L-Tryptophan, which is often sold in health food stores to promote relaxation and to ease premenstrual syndrome and sleeping disorders. Medical officials also reported four cases in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, three in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and one each from <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> by Friday. At least five of those nine patients also used L-Tryptophan, said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the Health and <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Health officials have requested that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> retailers impose a voluntary ban on sales of L-Tryptophan while the investigation is under way. Teams from the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> came to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> Thursday to assist in the investigation. Personnel from health department's Office of Epidemiology and the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> will be working during the weekend to contact the confirmed cases, Ms. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said on Friday. `` They will be getting the patients' Tryptophan and then going back to the location where they purchased it and getting samples of the product for testing,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> will be doing a broad spectrum of tests,'' she said. `` Some of the things they might be looking for are heavy metals or other organic contaminants.'' Eosinophilia occurs when there is an abnormally high number of eosinophils, a type of white cell, in the blood. Sixteen people died in 1986 nationwide as a result of hypereosinophilic syndrome, a form of eosiniphilia, and 12 died in 1987, said <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> All of the eosinophilia cases in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> suffered severe muscle pain. Ten of the patients required hospital treatment and as of Friday one patient, a 51-year-old woman from Gallup, remained hospitalized in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleich </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Mayo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> said both the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> patients had taken L-Tryptophan. `` The thing that's unusual is seeing so many patients with the same pattern,'' <PERSON> Gleich </PERSON> said. `` What's different is there are so many at one time, and they're all taking L-Tryptophan.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>, who shepherded the automaker from the gloomy financial days of 1980 to huge profits last year, said Friday he would retire March 1 <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>, 63, will be succeeded as chairman and chief executive officer by Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Poling </PERSON>, who described his predecessor as a `` visionary leader.'' <PERSON> Poling </PERSON>, 64, will be chairman for three years. `` I have been chief operating officer or chief executive officer for 10 years, and I think that it is time for me to make a change in my life,'' <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> said, his eyes misting as he spoke at a news conference. During his decade at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's second-largest automaker staged a remarkable comeback. <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> was elected <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> president in March 1980. By the end of the year, the automaker lost $ 1.5 billion. Eight years later, after cost-cutting, streamlining and payroll shrinking, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> posted a $ 5.3 billion profit. `` I do want to thank the 367,000 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> employees for everything they have done these past 10 years to bring our company from the depths of our difficulties at the beginning of this decade to the sound footing upon which it stands today,'' <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> said. During the 1980s, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> embarked on ambitious and, at the time, risky car development programs that resulted in the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable cars. They helped paved the way for modern aerodynamic-looking cars. Succeeding <PERSON> Poling </PERSON> as chief operating officer will be <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, who will become corporate president. That title was dropped when <PERSON> Poling </PERSON> became vice chairman in October 1987. `` I'm surprised that <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> is retiring early,'' said analyst <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> `` I think he -LRB- Poling -RRB- is really going to sit there and wait it out for the next chairman.'' <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> joined <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> in 1949 and held a variety of positions in domestic and international product planning, design and marketing before he became president. <PERSON> Poling </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> career began in 1951 and focused mainly on the financial side of the corporation. <PERSON> Poling </PERSON> said his goal during the next three years is to continue current programs at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>. During <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>'s tenure, the company branched out and became heavily involved in financial acquisitions, capped last month with the completion of the purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 3.35 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s acquisitions spilled over into the automotive sector, too. It bought <ORGANIZATION> Aston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 and bid $ 2.5 billion last month for <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> officials have said they hope the <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> acquisition is completed by the end of the year.

 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s decision to open its borders to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> brought accolades from world leaders, tempered with caution from some and words of warning against too swift a move to reform. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> annnounced its support of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s action and <PERSON> Ferenc </PERSON> <PERSON> Kosa </PERSON>, a member the party's presidium, said `` the reforms now under way in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will contribute to the unfolding democratization in the whole region.'' <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> had been concerned about East German insensitivity to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s own reforms before the replacement of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s hard-line leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> last month by <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> On Sept. 10, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> opened its borders to East Germans wishing to emigrate to the West, and tens of thousands used this route to flee their country before the dramatic announcement Thursday that they would be permitted to travel straight to the West from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told the Polish news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> the changes in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> `` should have been taken much earlier.'' `` The drama of the events in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is the result of earlier neglect, as usually happens when someone misses the train of history,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. Czechoslovak <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Lubomir </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsik </PERSON> said the opening of the East German border `` represents a positive solution.'' `` The situation was getting difficult for everybody, including <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>,'' he said, referring to the thousands of East Germans who previously were forced to go West via a third country, often <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> offered their military camps in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to handle the expected flood of people from the east. French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said moves toward freedom and democracy in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> `` open a new phase in European history'' and added he hoped to visit <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> <PERSON> IV </PERSON>, rejected speculation about reunification and said the changes under way in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> increase the risk of instability. But Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnandze </PERSON> called the border opening `` a reasonable and sensible decision'' and added that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was not worried that the pace of events in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> was a threat. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, however, said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was concerned about instability brought on by the exodus of East Germans to the West. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> stressed the border between <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> remained in force and that eased travel restrictions should not be taken as heralding the imminent reunification of the two Germanies split since the end of World War II. He warned that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> `` should take into account that policies aimed at reconsidering borders would not suit any government in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and would cause only mistrust.'' It was `` a great day for freedom,'' said <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. But the fast pace of reforms in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> called `` for keeping a very cool head and being very steady and being very practical about it,'' she added. Asked about the possibility of reunification, she replied, `` You are going much too fast. You have to take these things step by step. The first thing is to get a genuine multiparty democracy in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' the prime minister said. Prime Minister <PERSON> Harri </PERSON> <PERSON> Holkeri </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> told Finnish radio, `` As far as I can see, the final outcome of World War II still stands and the situation will not change because of these developments.'' The Belgian government, calling the move `` a victory for freedom and democratic ideals,'' also urged caution. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Eyskens </PERSON>, the Belgian foreign minister, said: `` Those who demand new frontiers are irresponsible. ... Measured progress is required to avoid anarchy.'' Also speaking in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> External Affairs Commissioner <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON> said the East European nations were not yet ready for EEC membership. But French Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> said the thawing of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> creates obligations for the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>. The West should reflect on `` these two or three new pieces of data which are going to change the face of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and probably the global balance,'' <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> said. The West was now `` called upon to stretch out its hand even further for cooperation to -LRB- remove -RRB- the economic deficit in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' said Austrian Chancellor <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON>. The Spanish government called for free elections and said <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s decision `` opens a path of hope in the democratic development of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said: `` We see this event as part of an inevitable process which must lead to further reform, free elections and full self-determination by the population.''

 <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> officials agreed Friday to take back a trainload of sewage sludge after authorities in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> refused to let a disposal company unload the `` Pooh Pooh Choo-Choo'' in their states. Mayor <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmoke </PERSON> felt that although <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> was not legally obligated to take back the nonhazardous waste shipment, it did have a moral obligation to do so, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Balog </PERSON>, the city's public works director. The first of the 63 carloads will begin arriving in about nine days at the <LOCATION> Back </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> waste treatment plant that produced the sludge, he said. The 5,000 tons of sludge will be treated with lime and then transferred to a facility that will mix the waste with leaves and sell it as compost, he said. Back River is under a court order to reduce a backlog of sludge at the plant. The cost of returning the sludge to <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> will be borne by <ORGANIZATION> GSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Balog </PERSON> said. GSX contracted with the city to dispose of the sludge and initially sent it to its waste treatment facility in White Castle, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, but residents of Assumption Parish complained vehemently about the stench. The company moved the train to <LOCATION> Moss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> in southeast <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> on Nov. 3, but <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> officials threatened to fine GSX $ 2 million a day if the company did n't take it out of the state. GSX will get a chance to challenge the fines during a hearing Nov. 21. Private landfills in a number of states were willing to accept the shipment, but public officials refused to allow the waste in, <PERSON> Balog </PERSON> said. `` The permitted landfills are there,'' he said. `` However, because of this particular issue of this sludge train, it became so controversial that state officials did not want to accept it.'' In <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pollution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ecology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> obtained a temporary restraining order Thursday preventing a landfill in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> from accepting the sludge.

 A solitary building stands on the far corner of the once teeming and elegant <PERSON> Potsdamer </PERSON> <PERSON> Platz </PERSON>, now a desolate no man's land overlooking a jagged corner of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall. <PERSON> Potsdamer </PERSON> <PERSON> Platz </PERSON> will soon regain at least a semblance of its former prominence after 28 years as a Cold War curiosity, East German officials said Friday. Devastated during World War II and long a lonely tourist attraction for a glimpse over the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, <ORGANIZATION> Potsdamer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Platz </ORGANIZATION> will shortly become another major transit checkpoint between East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Its opening comes as part of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s decision to open its borders to the West, officials say. Since the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall was built in 1961, <LOCATION> Potsdamer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Platz </LOCATION> and similar landmarks have been sober reminders of the brutal division of the city and the two Germanys. For many Berliners, the blockaded <ORGANIZATION> Brandenburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gate </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Potsdamer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Platz </LOCATION> are the starkest symbols of that division. In both cases, two main thoroughfares end abrubtly at the concrete base of the imposing, graffiti-smeared Wall. When Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> told a rally in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> that the East Germans had decided to punch a hole through the Wall at <LOCATION> Potsdamer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Platz </LOCATION>, the crowd roared with applause and cheers. Another famous crossing has also taken on new tasks. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s Glienicke Bridge, a frequent site of East-West swaps of spies and political prisoners, has since been opened to accommodate more travelers. Another notorious stretch of the Wall is also to be opened _ <ORGANIZATION> Bernauer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strasse </ORGANIZATION>, where scenes of dramatic escape attempts stunned the world 28 years ago. A house near the new checkpoint still stands with its westward-facing windows boarded and sealed with bricks, testimony to the first desperate attempts to jump to freedom as the Wall was going up. Nearby, others died later in escape attempts that ended in a hail of bullets. Eighty people died trying to cross the Wall. The Wall's most famous crossing, Checkpoint <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON>, will remain in use for foreign visitors, although East German border guards have allowed scores of East Berliners to use the crossing since travel restrictions were lifted on Friday. No plans have surfaced so far to tear down the concrete barriers that stand in front of the massive, 18th-century Brandenburg Gate, which for decades has been a rallying point of protest against the city's partition.

 <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> on Friday said <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is witnessing `` a new generation'' of leadership, with the new guard dedicated to reuniting the divided continent. The Solidarity leader made his comments to reporters at <LOCATION> Mirabel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> as he began a 10-day visit to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. During the visit, he will travel to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Airport onlookers cheered the shipyard electrician who spearheaded Solidarity's successful challenge to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s communist leadership. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> rejected suggestions that he had been the catalyst for the changes now occurring in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` Everyone is responsible, the media, the television, everybody,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. `` A new generation is taking over. We want one unified <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Earlier in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told the Polish news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> the changes in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which include relaxing travel restrictions, the promise of democratic elections and the resignations of longtime Communist leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> and his ruling Politburo, `` should have been taken much earlier.'' `` The drama of the events in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is the result of earlier neglect, as usually happens when someone misses the train of history,'' he said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, 46, is on a foreign tour to plead for aid and foreign investment for economically strapped <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. After 10 days in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, he will conclude his trip with a visit to <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> Nov. 19. The 1983 Nobel Peace Prize winner was greeted at the airport by <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> and <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Laberge </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Quebec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> flew into <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> late Friday for weekend meetings with political leaders and tributes by the local Polish community and a labor confederation in <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>. He is to travel to <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> Monday to meet Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> and then go to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for talks with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and to give an address to a joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Solidarity-led government has said that it needs at least $ 2.5 billion in loans from Western sources to begin its program for economic liberalization. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has no official role in the new government but is a close confidant of Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, a Solidarity veteran.

<HEAD>Britain's Defense Chief Says ``Lunacy'' To Renounce Strong Defense</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Defense Secretary <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> said in an interview published Friday that it would be lunacy for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to renounce its longstanding policy of strong defenses in the face of Eastern bloc reform and disarmament. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s independent nuclear deterrent could not be submitted as a bargaining factor at East-West disarmament talks `` for the foreseeable future,'' he said in the interview with the domestic British news agency <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Repeating what Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has said on previous occasions, <PERSON> King </PERSON> stressed that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> needed to maintain their guard against Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> forces and said he believed the British public would understand this, <LOCATION> PA </LOCATION> reported. It said he also pointed to difficulties being faced at East-West talks on conventional arms reductions in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and warned there was a considerable way to go in this area. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> are the only two West European nations who have their own nuclear forces independent of the the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear arsenal. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> plans to update its ageing submarine-borne <ORGANIZATION> Polaris </ORGANIZATION> nuclear missiles by the mid-1990s with a more powerful Trident system bought from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. PA quoted King as saying: `` It is true the present tremendous changes might make some people think we do n't need defense any more. But it is a very human emotion to see your own country properly defended.'' He said events in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were happening fast and it was impossible to predict how they would turn out, <ORGANIZATION> PA </ORGANIZATION> reported. It quoted him as saying progress had been achieved by maintaining strong defenses to ensure that freedom in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> was not overwhelmed by communist pressures and intimidation. `` By being prepared to maintain strong defenses, we have seen this opportunity for improvement. The one thing which would be lunacy and almost criminal would be just at this moment to change our approach which could damage this process of reform,'' <ORGANIZATION> PA </ORGANIZATION> reported him as saying. `` We must keep our defenses strong but respond in a positive and constructive way to the approaches from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact.'' <ORGANIZATION> PA </ORGANIZATION> said the interview by its defense correspondent <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was conducted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Thursday. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> this year shed its vote-losing policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament in favor of a multilateralist stance. Under this, a Labor government would only scrap <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s independent nuclear force in a negotiated arms control deal. Political analysts say Labor's defense policy change is a main reason for the current surge in the party's fortunes. Labor has lost three successive elections to Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> since 1979 but now leads the Conservatives by up to 12 points in opinion polls. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s new defense policy was merely a form of words to see the party through the next general election, due by mid-1992.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised Friday `` to seize every chance'' to promote democracy in turbulent <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> but Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> ruled out substantial Western aid for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> until `` there is political pluralism across the board.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, traveling in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, noted the spectacle of Berliners hacking at the wall that divides their city with hammers and chisels and the opening of 18 crossings in the wall and said he was surprised at the speed of change. The accelerating torrent of change in previously closed societies `` offers us all much hope and deserves our continued encouragement,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> speech. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> spoke with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by telephone for 18 minutes and gave him a `` thorough briefing on the first part of his trip to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and on developments in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> congratulated <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> on his handling of the East German situation and `` promised the full cooperation of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The two `` agreed that these dramatic developments make the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> meeting -LRB- between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> -RRB- even more important and agreed to consult closely between now and the meeting,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He said they would talk again next week. Speaking a day after the East German government announced a lifting of all travel restrictions and just before news arrived of a promise of free elections in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` We will seize every opportunity to contribute to lasting peace and to extend democracy.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> offered no specifics as to future policy, saying only that he would be guided by `` prudence'' and `` imagination.'' But in remarks at a fund-raising dinner for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON>, the president sounded a note of restraint. `` The best way to keep <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the West free is to keep the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> strong,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` This country must not base its foreign policy or its national security on the aspirations of one man inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> or anywhere else.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> departed from his text to add: `` We're living in exciting times. The rapidity of change is mind-boggling, and I will do my level best to conduct an imaginative foreign policy, but I will be prudent. ... I will do my best to move freedom forward.'' He said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> `` asked me to share with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people his conviction ... that this remarkable change that's taking place in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, most recently in the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democratic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, could never have taken place without the steadfast loyal support of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' As the president was speaking, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was promising free elections, freedom of association and assembly, supervision of security forces by parliament and an end to official privileges. <ORGANIZATION> Egon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, the new party general secretary, told a rally, `` We have a great task before us, a revolution on German soil.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> hinted at a go-slow approach toward <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` There's a long way to go before there is true freedom and true political pluralism in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, while calling the East German decision to open its borders `` the most dramatic event in East-West relations'' since the end of World War II, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other allies believe any discussion of an aid program now would be premature. The allies, he said, will be much more forthcoming about helping <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> only if there is `` political pluralism across the board.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said freedom to travel must be followed by other steps before there can be a serious discussion of a united <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

Comments in official <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> all day mixed caution with exaltation. Housing and Urban Development Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, traveling with the president, captured some of the exaltation in reporting on a conversation with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during the flight to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>: `` We talked about <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the thrill in our hearts and minds of all people everywhere over what's happening with the crumbling of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall,'' he said. `` We can not house the world,'' said <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, `` but we can definitely do our best to be compassionate'' and help <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> cope with the flood of refugees from the East. While some analysts predicted that some possible changes in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> could mean the breakup of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials like <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> did not go that far _ but conceded there would be changes in the alliance. Meanwhile, important senators welcomed the changes in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and called for further liberalization, including free elections. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s ambassador, <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Herder </PERSON>, said he found President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s reaction to the events in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> `` encouraging'' but warned that any miscalculation in the Western reaction could lead to `` bigger conflicts.'' In a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Herder </PERSON> promised that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would be `` a predictable partner'' for the West. He noted that the East German armed forces are only a short distance away from the American, British and French forces stationed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. `` By any miscalculation, they could be involved. This could lead to a conflict,'' he said. Asked whether he could foresee a unified <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Herder </PERSON> replied: `` In my dreams, yes. But being a politician, I do n't see any prospect for a united <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' because the two Germanies are members of opposing alliances. The only action taken by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has been an offer of `` all possible assistance'' to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> government as it struggles to cope with the flood of refugees. The Pentagon said it was making available housing for 980 people in three off-base installations. `` Were we surprised by the speed of it?'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> asked in a separate interview on CBS. `` You bet your life.'' Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement, `` <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> should also hold truly democratic elections.'' Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, R-Ind., a former committee chairman, said the East German authorities may be intent on getting rid of `` the bad eggs'' before moving to restore the hard-line system <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said the `` very positive'' changes, if they led to non-Communist governments in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, would mean `` less of a threat'' and that in turn `` might portend some changes on our side.'' One change, said retired Gen. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> commander, would be fewer <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> _ there are 340,000 now _ and a revision in the `` forward strategy'' that puts fighting units close to the border.

 Americans expect greater wealth in the 1990s, but also greater crime. They see better days for their schools, but worsening pollution in their skies. They think they'll be smoking less, and doing drugs more. One of the most widely held expectations for the next decade is for a Democrat to win the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a national survey by <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> has found. Among the least-expected developments: the demise of communism. In the broadest measures, many respondents expressed optimism about the future. Roughly six in 10 expected life for others to improve in the next decade, and three-quarters saw their own lives getting better. But there were sobering assessments on some issues. More than six in 10 expected pollution and crime to worsen, and almost as many saw more AIDS, homelessness and world hunger as the year 2000 approaches. The environment stood out as a chief concern. Twelve percent expected pollution to be the nation's greatest problem a decade from now; only drug abuse was named by more, 17 percent. Moreover, 65 percent expected pollution to worsen in the next 10 years. And almost half said the warming of the atmosphere because of pollution, known as the greenhouse effect, could threaten human survival. Education, conversely, was a bright spot: Fifty-eight percent expected it to improve in the next decade. Personal wealth also was a point of optimism, with 56 percent expecting their family's financial situation to improve But respondents divided about evenly when asked whether they expected the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy to improve, worsen or remain about the same. And 52 percent expected the federal budget deficit to worsen. Younger respondents in many cases were the most pessimistic, and optimism often increased with age. For example, 52 percent of those aged 18-24 expected the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to become involved in a war in the next decade, while just 41 percent of their elders shared their fear. And among the oldest group, over 64 years old, just 27 percent expected war. Similarly, six in 10 in the youngest group expected drug abuse to worsen and two-thirds of them saw acquired immune deficiency syndrome as a growing problem, while nearer to half of the older respondents said so. The most widely expected eventualities were a Democrat winning the presidency, which 72 percent called likely; cigarette smokers shrinking to a tiny minority of the population, which 59 percent called likely; and much greater restrictions on abortion, which were expected by 56 percent. The poll found a lowering of some expectations in the past decade. In a 1979 survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Roper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, 51 percent expected the four-day work week to become common in the 1980s; when the question was repeated in the new poll, just 41 percent held that expectation for the 1990s. Expectations also changed on energy issues. Fewer people now expect new energy sources to end dependency on oil _ 49 percent, compared with 60 percent in 1979. And more expect the role of nuclear power to decline _ 45 percent now, compared with 33 percent 10 years ago. More people are dubious that racial and religious discrimination could largely disappear _ 77 percent think not, compared with 66 percent in 1979. In both polls, nine in 10 doubted that poverty will be almost eliminated. Other possibilities were expected by sizable groups, though not majorities. Slightly more than one-third said it was likely the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would win control of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the 1990s; nearly four in 10 expected a woman to be elected president; 42 percent called it likely <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> astronauts will reach Mars; and 42 percent expected cures for cancer and for AIDS. On international affairs, 46 percent expected terrorism to worsen, with the rest roughly divided between its improving or remaining about the same. And regardless of pro-democracy movements in many communist countries, 70 percent called it unlikely that communism will largely disappear in the 1990s. The poll was conducted by telephone Sept. 14-24 among a random sample of 1,071 adult Americans, and had a margin of error of 3 percentage points. <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a communications company based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal, and operates TV stations <ORGANIZATION> WXFL </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, WCBD in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> WJKS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.

 This <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll is based on telephone interviews Sept. 14-24 with 1,071 adults in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Phone numbers were selected randomly and interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recent birthday, a random phenomenon. The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample. The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that 19 of 20 times its findings should be within 3 points of the result if every adult American were asked the same questions. The error margin is larger for subgroups. There are other sources of potential error in polls, including the wording and order of questions. These are the questions in this poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100: 1. What do you think will be the most important problem facing this country 10 years from now? Drugs: 17 percent.

<HEAD>Africa is Becoming Major Route for Heroin Smuggling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHEGE MBITIRU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Islamic revolution and the war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> have made <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> a major smuggling route for <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s heroin. Most of it is finding its way to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but some goes to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Africans latching on to the trafficking are finding the money is too good to resist, particularly on a continent with a high unemployment rate and serious ecomomic problems. The wholesale price for a kilogram -LRB- 2.2 pounds -RRB- of pure heroin is about $ 150,000, and for an African trying to scrape by the temptation might be too great. That is one reason the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has begun to help African authorities combat trafficking, even though most of the heroin winds up in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are concerned that if trafficking takes greater hold in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> it could bring new instability to the continent. The heroin comes from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION>, the international police organization, says 236 Africans were arrested and 1,160 pounds of heroin seized last year in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. That represents a sharp increase since 1984, when <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION> recorded the arrests of only 11 Africans carrying 105 pounds of heroin in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. While <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION> is unable to estimate the amount of the heroin moving through <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, it says the number of Africans arrested in 1988 indicates it has been sharply on the rise. Previously, <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> Asian nationals smuggled heroin to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> overland through <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Balkan </LOCATION> countries. Some was diverted to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and later smuggled to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by air or sea. However, the overland route was disrupted by the Soviet military intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979 and a ruthless crackdown on drugs by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Islamic leaders. With the traditional route blocked, traffickers turned to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. But African governments were ill-equipped and too inexperienced in the narcotics trade to deal effectively with the problem. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Masemo </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s anti-narcotics squad, said, for example: `` At first we did n't know what we were looking for.'' In an effort to stop the heroin from reaching their streets, Western governments, including <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> as well as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, now are helping the African nations. In September, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration sent <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, to persuade <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> to renew an agreement under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> assists the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> nation's anti-drugs effort. An agreement was signed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> soon after. A month later <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> signed a similar pact. <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION> figures indicate the majority of the African traffickers are from <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gambia </LOCATION>. `` But no African nation is unaffected by the trafficking of <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> heroin,'' says <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fortier </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION>'s drugs subdivision The heroin enters <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> by air and sea mainly through eastern countries, with <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> favored because of frequent connecting flights to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the drug is repackaged and carried by individual couriers or hidden in freight shipments to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION> says the smugglers use all major airports in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. However, an enterprising few have slipped through East European airports, including <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. The seriousness of the problem was underlined in June at an Interpol-sponsored meeting in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>. Narcotics agents from 25 countries in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> attended the closed-door meeting. `` We concluded the situation was increasingly getting worse,'' said an African participant who spoke only on condition of anonymity. `` We also felt African governments ca n't fight the drugs menace alone. We need assistance.'' <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Unger </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, says the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> spent at least $ 124,000 in 1987 and 1988 to help fight the trafficking. The money bought vehicles, communications and drug-detecting equipment, as well as sniffer dogs, and paid for the training of narcotics agents, customs agents and judicial officers. The beneficiaries included <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Cameroon </LOCATION>. In addition, <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Togo </LOCATION> each received drugs testing kits worth between $ 200 and $ 300 each last year. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also is planning a $ 75,000 West African contraband customs school for <LOCATION> Benin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Togo </LOCATION>. A similar one for English-speaking <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION> would cost $ 40,000, <PERSON> Unger </PERSON> says.

<HEAD>Developing Nations Struggling to Cope With Global Warming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND DE LIGNY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NOORDWIJK, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Herik </PERSON> <PERSON> Othieno </PERSON>, an environmentalist, is pretty sure the greenhouse effect has come to his <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> homeland because malarial mosquitos native to the hot lowlands have migrated to the cool highlands. `` With temperatures rising worldwide, there are strong indications that their presence is one of the results of the greenhouse effect,'' <PERSON> Othieno </PERSON> said in an interview here. For many Third World nations, troubled by fragile economies and substandard agricultural sectors, the greenhouse effect's global warming will have grave consequences, environmental experts warned here recently at an international conference on the greenhouse effect. While industrialized countries have the scientific potential to find technological solutions to the problem and the money to pay for them, most developing nations are unable to cope with it. `` Unfortunately, they do not have the means,'' said <PERSON> Celso </PERSON> <PERSON> Roque </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> delegation to the 68-nation conference. Some experts believe global warming, which amounted to a 1.5-degree -LRB- Fahrenheit -RRB- rise in the average worldwide temperature over the past century, is caused mainly by the carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, factories and cars in the industrialized world. At the <LOCATION> Noordwijk </LOCATION> conference, delegates adopted a resolution calling for stabilization of carbon dioxide emissions `` as soon as possible.'' But the two largest industrialized nations, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, refused to commit themselves to the year 2000 as the date by which stabilization should be implemented. Many scientists predict that if the emissions _ and those of other gases associated with the greenhouse effect _ continue, the pace of global warming could increase four to sevenfold in the next century. `` I predict the Third World will be hardest hit by such a rise in temperatures,'' said the American environmentalist <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> of the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. `` Think of their current unstable food situation _ it can only get worse as their agricultural sectors collapse under environmental pressure,'' <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> told a reporter outside the conference room. Many experts, among them <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s Othieno, believe the greenhouse effect will ultimately lead to a vast increase in desert areas. Some experts also predict that low-lying coastal and delta nations such as <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> could be inundated as the sea level rises as a result of the melting polar ice caps. `` We may suppose that the absence of rains, and the unpredictable character of the weather in general, are initial signs of the greenhouse effect,'' said <PERSON> Othieno </PERSON>, a staff member of a Nairobi-based environmentalist group called Energy and <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Roque </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> painted a gloomy picture of a Third World hit by droughts precipitated by the greenhouse effect. `` Crop lands will turn into deserts, there will be more forest fires. ... Hydroelectric dams and irrigation systems will be rendered useless,'' <PERSON> Roque </PERSON> told delegates. Continued global warming could result in an ominous change in the oceans, he said. `` Ocean currents will be modified with unpredictable consequences for world fisheries.'' Many conference officials from developing nations said the industrialized world, where 65 percent of all greenhouse-related emissions originate, should take the lead in reversing the trend. `` The incessant large-scale burning of non-renewable fossil fuels in the North is ecologically disgraceful,'' <PERSON> Roque </PERSON> said. Delegates here also agreed to set up a fund to help developing nations cope not only with the consequences of climate change, but also with one of its major causes _ destruction of tropical rain forests. `` We must protect the scant natural resources we have in the Third World,'' <PERSON> Othieno </PERSON> said. That involves more than just conservation, for there are also pressing social and economic dimensions, <PERSON> Roque </PERSON> noted. `` Population growth drives the impoverished landless peasants into forest lands, where they slash and burn the forests to eke out a living,'' he said. `` The pressure to generate foreign exchange for the heavy debt payments and the political necessity of providing employment justify commercial logging.''

<TEXT>
 For 45-year-old <PERSON> Savitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Devi </PERSON>, the routine of cooking, drawing water from the well, cleaning her one-story brick house and taking an afternoon nap soon will be broken _ but only for a time. Later this month, millions like <PERSON> Devi </PERSON> in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s farming villages will decide who should govern their country. The burden of choosing rests lightly on <PERSON> Devi </PERSON>'s shoulders. `` I'll vote for whomever my husband votes for,'' she says in Hindi, sitting in the warmth of the sun on a rope cot outside her home. More than three-fourths of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 498 million voters live in villages, making the rural vote the most important electoral bank for any party in the elections for Parliament and prime minister <PERSON> Nov </PERSON>, 22, 24 and 26. <PERSON> Devi </PERSON> expresses resentment at the governing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which she blames for the high price of sugar and the cutting down of the forest outside the village. The men of <LOCATION> Sanoli </LOCATION>, a village of 2,000 people 70 miles southwest of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, talk of wider issues, but their political leanings soon escalate into arguments. The village is in the northern state of <LOCATION> Rajasthan </LOCATION> and has usually been considered a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> stronghold. `` These people do not know what they are talking about,'' says 72-year-old <PERSON> Hari </PERSON> <PERSON> Krishan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharma </PERSON>, the village priest, referring to a group of villagers who derided his support for the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` I am a wise elephant surrounded by barking dogs. `` What will you give water to? To a tree firmly planted in the soil or to a sapling which will be blown away in the next storm?'' The question was intended to illustrate Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s promise of stable government _ the firmly planted tree _ if he and his <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> are returned to power. But others sitting on a raised platform outside the village temple were unconvinced. <PERSON> Budh </PERSON> <PERSON> Ram </PERSON>, a wiry mustachioed farmer, said two years of rule by the opposition had given more to the village than the 39 years of rule by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` We voted the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to power in the last elections. The candidate is my sister's brother-in-law. But he has n't visited the village once in these five years. He'll be routed this time,'' <PERSON> Ram </PERSON> said. `` Only senile old men like him will vote for the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> now,'' he said, gesturing toward <PERSON> Sharma </PERSON>. Usually divided opposition parties have united for the second time in history to fight the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The previous attempt was briefly successful, when the opposition dislodged the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> from power in 1977, ousting <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, from the prime minister's office. But the fragile unity soon disentegrated and midterm polls were called in 1980, which were won by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> returned and was assassinated four years later. The opposition is focusing this year on its charges of corruption and inept leadership by <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, who succeeded his mother in 1984. The viewpoint has been brought to <LOCATION> Sanoli </LOCATION> by word-of-mouth or read in newspapers by the few literate people in the village. Television and radio are controlled by the state and little anti-governement news is broadcast. `` The people tilling the fields go to sleep hungry,'' <PERSON> Ram </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> lives luxuriously and spends fortunes in hotels. Where has the money from <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> gone?'' The reference was to opposition charges that senior <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> politicians and government officials received millions of dollars in kickbacks from the Swedish firm, <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION>, for a $ 1.4 billion contract to supply artillery to the Indian army. The charges have become a rallying cry for the opposition. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> has denied the charges and says he is not personally involved. Another issue is the government's involvement in the ethnic strife in neighboring <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, where at least 1,100 Indian soldiers sent to restore peace have been killed in fighting Tamil rebels. The issue is live in <LOCATION> Sanoli </LOCATION> because five young men from the village have died in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> sent our children to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, who runs a small grocery store. `` Why did we have to go to another man's home? I do n't blame the Sri Lankans. I'll kill anyone who interferes in my home.''

 <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> once shared little besides I-95, the American League and Eastern Time. <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> was blue-collar muscle, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> white-collar power; there were <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Colts </ORGANIZATION> fans, and there were Senators and <ORGANIZATION> Redskins </ORGANIZATION> fans.

As it moves into its last decade, they are sprawling out in all directions. `` Metropolitan areas are bumping into each other,'' says <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Muller </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> urban geographer. `` It's been happening for years, but now you can really see it.'' You can see it in the region between <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where `` Megalopolis'' _ the vast city forecast by <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Gottman </PERSON> 30 years ago _ now includes 25 continguous metropolitan areas and one-sixth of the nation's population. The <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> says the four most advanced sections of Megalopolis are Boston-Providence, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Harrisburg-York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Washington-Baltimore </LOCATION>. Within each section, substantial numbers of people live in one metro area and commute to another. The metropolitan economies of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> are the most tightly entwined. Here in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, 24 miles from the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monument </LOCATION>, 14 from <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>'s Inner Harbor, couples like <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> and <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Klukas </PERSON> rise each morning and head off in opposite directions, she toward <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, he toward <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Their big city loyalties are mixed. They read both the Sun and the Post, but <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> says they're more apt to visit downtown <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, which is an easier drive. Fellow Columbians Pepper and <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>, on the other hand, find themselves attending more social functions in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where he is an executive at The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times. Residents of BaltWash exult in the area's great variety of goods, services and attractions. You can take in opera at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> one night and visit the National Aquarium in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> the next day. When <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s baseball Senators and <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION>'s football Colts defected, the sting was eased by the presence of the pro teams that remained. Each of the merging metro areas is becoming more economically diverse. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is known for bureaucracy, but its immediate suburbs have many high-tech industries. <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>'s skyline is now characterized not by smokestacks but office towers. Others see a darker side to BaltWash. When <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> resident <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Knudson </PERSON> was growing up in the suburbs west of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, there was still plenty of open space. Now, says his wife <PERSON> Jean </PERSON>, `` the traffic is awful, and every square inch has something on it _ houses, townhouses or apartments.'' BaltWash _ or WashBalt _ is just one part of the emerging Megalopolis. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> are meeting in <LOCATION> Bucks </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and along the highways leading to the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Muller </PERSON> notes, `` is beginning to fill in. There are no real breaks in the urban landscape.'' Although the city of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> has fewer than 600,000 people and covers only 47 square miles, its metropolitan domain stretches north into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, west to <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION> and south to <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> has been doing this for so long,'' marvels <PERSON> Forstall </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. `` It absorbed <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> in the 1800s and never looked back.'' A continent away, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> are on a collision course as new housing clusters pop up in the arid expanses between them. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area has become one vast metropolis in which <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Franciscans </LOCATION> comprise only 13 percent of the population. Specialists debate how far and fast this expansion will go, but <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> urban affairs expert <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sternlieb </PERSON> says one thing is clear: `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is decentralizing faster than any society in history.'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a planner at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION>, says his research shows that if present trends continue, by 2020 or 2030 almost half of the mainland could be classified `` exurban'' _ places where people live on five -, 10 - or even 30-acre tracts, and drive fairly long distances to jobs, social engagements, and other The only land with nothing on or near it, he says, will be government-owned or `` undevelopable,'' such as mountains and flood plains. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> is struck by the speed with which industry is moving beyond the urban periphery. Once, manufacturers needed to be near the city's workers and rail lines, but now tax laws and land prices encourage them to spread out, as long as they remain within a day's truck ride of the city That requires limited-access highways, of which the nation has plenty. Federal transportation planner <PERSON> Douglass </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> says one-third of the interstates carry fewer than 8,000 vehicles a day _ enough to fill only a two-lane street. For every I-95, busy from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, there is an I-88, virtually empty from <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Binghamton </LOCATION>, N.Y. Such routes do not serve American settlement; they spread it. `` Look at the map of the interstate system,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> historian <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fishman </PERSON>, `` and you will see the future of the American city.'' In other words, the future lies in such places as <LOCATION> Ulster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Loudon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, where the city dweller now still can find the balm of open space. The walls seem to be closing in. <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> once observed, from the vantage point of crowded <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, that `` in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> there is more room where nobody is than where everybody is. That is what makes <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> what it is.'' Or was.

<HEAD>Public TV's `Sesame Street' Starts 21st Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the beginning there was <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganz </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooney </PERSON> and a secretary. Then came Big Bird, <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON>, the Cookie Monster and more. They still ask if you can tell them, please, how to get to `` Sesame Street.'' Millions of kids _ many of whom now are adults _ know the way well. The series starts its 21st year today on public TV, having grown to a staff of 92, including 10 actors and 13 Muppet players. For some time now, its audience has been more than American. Its English-language version is seen in more than 80 countries, and it has 15 international co-productions, its makers say. But it's still aimed at kids aged 1 through 5, particularly those of poor, inner-city families. And the goal of the one-hour series is the same now as in 1969: To teach as well as entertain. Now costing $ 12 million annually to make, 80 per cent of that from commercial licensing of its characters and 20 per cent from PBS stations, according to its makers, it began with definite marching orders. `` I said, ` Let's do a kind of `` Laugh-In'' for kids,' `` recalls <PERSON> Cooney </PERSON>, the founder and since 1988 chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workshop </ORGANIZATION>, maker of `` Sesame Street'' and subsequent teach-the-tykes shows Her walk to `` Sesame Street'' began when she was a TV consultant for the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>, a foundation she joined after writing a study called `` The <ORGANIZATION> Potential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Uses </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> in Preschool Education.'' When she left to start the show, she told its producers it should have animation, puppets, a studio, `` and let's not have a single host. Let's have at least four hosts who will be men, women, black, white, Hispanic, and so on.'' Having decreed a pre-Jesse <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, she also wanted each show periodically `` interrupted by ` non-commercials' to teach letters and numbers,'' the basic-education snippets that still air on the show. And the installation of <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>'s Muppets, `` was a very critical decision'' in the show's success, says <PERSON> Cooney </PERSON>, a former reporter from <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, who also has been an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> publicist and public TV documentary maker. -LRB- Interestingly, <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Kermit </PERSON> the Frog, never was a regular. He only was a guest visitor, a <ORGANIZATION> CTW </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman says, and he still hops in now and then. -RRB- There have been some additions and changes, the biggest of the latter the expanded range of what <PERSON> Cooney </PERSON> calls `` curriculum aims.'' Among other things, today's `` Street'' watchers get a taste of math and science. And, <PERSON> Cooney </PERSON> says, they also see teen-agers, a student from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and people with various disabilities, from Down's syndrome to hearing and vision problems. There also are segments on emotions. `` We've dealt with death, with love and marriage, with pregnancy and childbirth, with adoption, with anger,'' she says. `` We also have a goal of teaching children to cooperate ... we consciously model the acceptance of all people, of treating people kindly.'' Like Oscar the Grouch, <PERSON> Cooney </PERSON> can get a tad testy, but mainly at those who say the fast pace of `` Sesame Street'' has led to the <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION> Generation of short attention spans. A bum rap, she submits. `` Street'' has longer pieces now, she says, with virtually every show given a `` plotted story line all the way through'' that is interrupted only for the educational `` non-commercials.'' `` We did n't make <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION> possible,'' she says. She thought she had made it clear in many speeches, she adds, that `` we followed ` Laugh-In.' We followed the revolution of TV. We did not create the revolution in television.'' A recent development _ the Cable Monster _ and such child-getting cable channels as <ORGANIZATION> Nickelodeon </ORGANIZATION> and its `` Bugs Bunny'' and `` Road Runner'' reruns have had an impact on the `` Street'' audience, but only in the afternoon, she says. `` Our ` Sesame Street' morning audience is not affected, and that's always been our biggest audience,'' she says. Not so in the afternoon, when the pre-schoolers' older brothers and sisters come home from school. They tend to take over the set. With cable added to their viewing choices, the competition is strong, not only against `` Street'' but also <ORGANIZATION> CTW </ORGANIZATION>'s older-kids math show, `` Square One TV'' and its science show, `` 3-2-1 Contact.'' As it starts this season, `` Street'' will portray more teen-agers, and have two new topics _ the environment and geography. The latter, she says, is because `` we know our children are not learning geography.'' The former, already a semiregular story on network newscasts, is joining the `` Street,'' <PERSON> Cooney </PERSON> says, because `` we feel that for their survival, the children had better learn about the environment.''

<HEAD>Kay Lenz Reprises Emmy-Winning Role as AIDS Victim</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenz </PERSON> wanted to show the special problems faced by women with AIDS in her role on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Midnight Caller,'' and so she talked with those who know best. The actress, who won an Emmy for her portrayal of <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON>, met with a support group for women with AIDS in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The episode, her third appearance as <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Killian </PERSON>'s former girlfriend, will be telecast Tuesday. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> stars as <PERSON> Killian </PERSON>. `` We decided to integrate the support group into the script,'' she said. `` They will go on <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>'s radio show to inform the public about the specific problems of women. Everything these actresses say is true because we got it right from the mouths of the support group. `` The problem is that women do n't have the political power that men have. They do n't have the financial power. No matter how independent a woman is, it's part of a woman's nature to take care of others. Women with AIDS often have to take care of themselves. They're not prepared for this. Ninety percent of the women I met are mothers.'' <PERSON> Lenz </PERSON> added: `` Men with AIDS deal with friends and lovers. Women deal with family members because often their children may have it.'' <PERSON> Lenz </PERSON> won an Emmy last year as best guest actress in a drama series for her role on `` Midnight Caller.'' She first played the part in the series' pilot episode. The AIDS episode last year caused considerable controversy in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, where the series is filmed. <PERSON> Lenz </PERSON> played a heterosexual woman who is infected by a man. In the first version of the script, the man is shot down in the streets. Protesters felt this would make AIDS victims into targets. The script was rewritten before it was filmed to eliminate the shooting. In the current episode <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> is near death and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> takes her in and comforts her. `` This is a very different show,'' said <PERSON> Lenz </PERSON>. `` We were taking a chance doing it again. We consulted many people, and the writer, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Zito </PERSON>, did a lot of research. This show also talks about the isolation and prejudice attached to AIDS. It comes from ignorance, and from that comes abandonment and prejudice. If I so much as stub my toe I want a hug. It would be hard for me to imagine being that ill and being abandoned. `` It's the same kind of attitude people had about leprosy in biblical times. I hope we can reach the people who turn the channel whenever AIDS is mentioned ... I had a lot of ignorance about AIDS myself before I did this role.'' She said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> have a wonderful relationship. `` They love each other unconditionally,'' she said. `` I love that it shows that people can have relationships. They may not work. She's lost her job as a teacher. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> takes her in. It's a debilitating disease, but <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>'s into denial. He does n't want to accept that her life will never be the same again, nor will his.'' When she was first offered the role last year she talked to the producers about changing the character's name. <PERSON> Lenz </PERSON> was formerly married to actor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON>. `` But they kept the name and it did n't bother me at all.'' Last summer, <PERSON> Lenz </PERSON> was seen as a police psychiatrist in the <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> movie `` Murder By Night.'' She made her film debut in 1973 as a teen-age hippie in `` Breezy,'' which starred <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Holden </PERSON> and was directed by <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON>. She was in the miniseries `` Rich Man, Poor Man'' in 1976 and the series `` Rich Man, Poor Man-Book II.'' <PERSON> Lenz </PERSON> has been a guest star on such shows as `` L.A. Law,'' `` Moonlighting,'' `` Hardball,'' `` Hill Street Blues'' and `` <ORGANIZATION> Cagney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON>.'' `` I like doing series work,'' she said. `` I'm always a different character, although I'm usually a victim. I'm usually dying or a prostitute or pregnant. It allows you to have another life besides going to the studio.''

<HEAD>A New Economic Model For the 1990s.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It's about time you received some reassuring economic news, about stability and less volatility and growing standards of living and other good things, and it comes from a highly credible source. `` The decade of the 1990s stands a very good chance of being the most prosperous of the century,'' says <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, who early in the 1980s helped produce a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic forecast that was remarkably on target. Ten years is a long time for any forecast, but <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> believes that there are vast and fundamental changes going on in the world that bode well, not just for Americans but for people everywhere. Among the most basic of those changes, he says, is a return to the market economy versus the corporate state _ a reliance on trade, on people rather than governments, on what works rather than ideology. Everywhere, he said, people and governments `` are repealing the 1930s.'' The model has changed, he said. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> is senior vice president and chief economist of Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>, part of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorp </ORGANIZATION>, which has banking affiliates and licensees in 21 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. And he is a former member of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>, helping in that role to produce a report back in 1981 that in some respects became a blueprint for the economy of the 1980s. One brief segment from that economic summary, published as the `` Economic Report of the President'' early in 1982: `` A critical element in this outlook is the assumption that inflationary expectations will, in fact, continue to recede. `` If they recede at a relatively fast rate, market rates of interest will decline significantly, wage demands will continue to moderate, and the pro-inflationary biases that have developed throughout the economy over the past decade will quickly disappear.'' It was right on the mark, but at the time it was made there were many doubters. A large element in the economic fraternity, for example, questioned whether an anti-inflationary policy could also be a growth policy. The 1980s proved it could be. Now that policy is espoused by the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. It is for such reasons, and others not stated, that <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s long-range economic forecast for the world is worth noting Early in the forecast is this statement: `` The end of more than 40 years of cold war and the victory of capitalism and democracy over socialism and totalitarianism in the contest of ideas have set the stage for more efficient use of global resources.'' Practicality and common sense are giving way to the recognition that market economies outperform centrally directed ones. The new model is the market economy for the simple reason it has shown it can outperform others. It is there for the world to see: <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> have become the three large economic and financial powers. A few years ago it was unimaginable that certain other nations would follow the model. Now it is so. `` In the coming decade, economic rivalries among the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, European and <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> enterprises in a global arena will move us further down the path of economic restructuring. `` Deregulation, denationalization, privatization, and tax reform will continue. `` Freer markets mean that natural comparative advantage will bring about greater productivity at a time when demographic trends also suggest a more experienced work force in major industrialized nations.'' <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>'s conclusion, therefore, is that the new model will be widely copied, that productivity will grow and that standards of living will rise more rapidly. Meanwhile, global markets for financial and real assets, and also tradable goods, will constrain the activities of economic policymakers, who sometimes have been known to succumb to political influence. Instead, the foreign exchange, equity and bond markets will play a policing role, `` helping to lower the amplitude of fluctuations in inflation, interest rates, exchange rates, output growth, and employment.'' And, he adds, `` this less volatile environment will be conducive to higher saving and investment.''

<HEAD>Pakistani Forces to Hold Their Largest Military Exercise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN WILDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two hundred thousand soldiers of the Pakistani army and air force are to hold the biggest military exercises in their 42-year history starting sometime in mid-December. The plan has prompted neighboring <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to strengthen its border force. The two countries have fought three wars since they gained independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1947 and still are not on the best of terms. Brig. <PERSON> Riaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Ullah </PERSON>, chief of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said the war games are code-named `` Zarbe Momin'' _ <LOCATION> Urdu </LOCATION> for `` the blow of the perfect Moslem'' _ and will test new tactics and weapons. Officials have not disclosed details or announced an exact starting date. <PERSON> Riaz </PERSON> said the games will involve one armored division and seven infantry divisions in central <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, at least 120 miles from the eastern border with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. The air force will conduct simultaneous operations under the code name `` Highmark.'' Indian war games along the frontier in January 1987, called `` Operation Brass Tacks,'' triggered a precautionary mobilization of Pakistani forces. <PERSON> Riaz </PERSON> said the Pakistani exercises will be held in a north-south corridor defined by the Indus and <LOCATION> Chenab </LOCATION> rivers in western <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> province. However, the area abuts an Indian-controlled section of the disputed <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> state. `` I do n't think these will cause the tensions we saw in 1987,'' <PERSON> Riaz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dilip </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinha </PERSON>, the first secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, said his government agrees. `` No, we do n't see it as a threat,'' he said. Nevertheless, a senior <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> military officer in southern <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> said additional Indian troops and tanks were being stationed along the border to `` deal with any eventuality.'' The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> security forces in <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> would increase from 10,000 to 100,000 by the start of the Pakistani maneuvers. `` We do not want to be caught unaware in case of any possible offensive,'' he said. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which is predominantly Moslem, has fought three unsuccessful wars with mainly Hindu <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> since their partition at the end of British colonial rule in 1947. Wars in 1948 and 1965 were over <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION>. In 1971, the two clashed over the establishment of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> as an independent nation in what had been <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Pakistani and Indian troops still trade artillery fire across the desolate Siachen Glacier, 21,000 feet up in the Himalayas in northern <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> near the Chinese border. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> occupies the western third of the 85,000-square-mile state. The two sides are separated by a diagonal cease-fire line drawn in 1949 that is still monitored by a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> military observer group. Gen. <PERSON> Mirza </PERSON> <PERSON> Aslam </PERSON> <PERSON> Beg </PERSON>, chief of the Pakistani army, has announced that foreign military observers, including some from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, will be invited to watch the exercises. `` Our exercise is above board, and not like the secret preparations <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> made two years ago to conduct its massive exercise, ` Operation Brass Tacks','' Beg said.

 Almost four years after he stomped out of a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> meeting and resigned from <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Heseltine </PERSON> remains the man voted most likely to succeed her as <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s prime minister. Despite tumbling opinion polls, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> shows no signs of slowing down after 10 years in power, however, and says she hopes to lead the Conservatives into one more general election before retiring. <PERSON> Heseltine </PERSON>, who is 56 years old and has a huge personal fortune, can afford to wait. In the meantime, the lean, 6-foot-3 <PERSON> Heseltine </PERSON> with his movie-star good looks is in big demand as a public speaker. He speaks with a slight lisp, suffers from the reading impairment dyslexia, has great personal charm and, despite the years out of office, ranks among the half dozen best-known politicians in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. His thick mane of blond hair and sometimes swashbuckling escapades earned him the nickname `` Tarzan,'' and it has stuck. He once lifted the ceremonial mace in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> and swung it around his head, and as <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary donned fatigues to try out new weapons firsthand, usually in front of the television cameras. Other Conservatives in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> _ who will eventually select Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s replacement as the party leader _ in particular want him to speak to their local party gatherings. That will one day enable him to `` call in the IOUs,'' the Spectator magazine said. <PERSON> Heseltine </PERSON> has been careful not to attack Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> directly. His usual response when asked whether he wants to succeed her is the bland observation that there are 350 Conservative members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> who want to lead the party. He also has avoided public recriminations about the dispute over an obscure helicopter-maker, <ORGANIZATION> Westland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, which led to his resignation as <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary in January 1986. <PERSON> Heseltine </PERSON> favored a European consortium's rescue bid for the ailing company over the eventual winner, the American Sikorsky company. But when ordered by Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> to clear his statements with the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, he walked out. She, too, was nearly forced out, when the dispute escalated over the leaking by government officials of documents designed to discredit <PERSON> Heseltine </PERSON>'s argument. <PERSON> Heseltine </PERSON>, who is pro-European, while Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> is combative toward the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, and to the left of her within the party, indulges in coded criticisms of her policies. He has called for more money to be put into inner city and educational reforms and has said Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s property tax, which taxes individuals rather than households, will become known as an unpopular `` Tory tax.'' He said the government's last interest rate increase was necessary to combat inflation, but he told a recent luncheon of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalists that `` whether we should have got into that situation is really the issue.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s annual conference, he told the government `` not to let the medicine drag out, dissipating our economic strength and dispersing our political support.'' Perhaps most significantly, <PERSON> Heseltine </PERSON> believes <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> should join the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, which limits swings in nine other <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> currencies. Opinion polls indicate <PERSON> Heseltine </PERSON> is the voters' choice to replace Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> as the Tory leader. A National Opinion Poll conducted for the newspaper The Mail on Sunday said 31 percent of 1,043 voters questioned believe <PERSON> Heseltine </PERSON> would be the best person to succeed her. The next closest candidate was Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, the deputy prime minister, with 17 percent. <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> television surveyed <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers and found 22 percent would like <PERSON> Heseltine </PERSON> to succeed Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, followed by 14 percent for party Chairman <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Heseltine </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Swansea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, the son of an army officer, and educated at a private boys' school and <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. At <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, he told friends he would be a millionaire by the age of 30 and then go into politics.

<TEXT>
 Health-conscious Americans are on an oats kick and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farmers are n't keeping up with the demand. Oat bran has become `` a buzz word,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> nutritionist <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON>. `` Everybody's got to have oat bran. You've got to have oat bran in this and that. I've seen potato chips with oat bran, and popcorn and everything else.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oats production rebounded this year from a drought-level 1988 output of 219 million bushels _ the lowest since the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> began records in 1866 _ to 371 million bushels this year. But that wo n't be enough, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will wind up in 1989-90 importing around 55 million bushels of oats. Last year, when drought shriveled yields, imports jumped to 68 million bushels. Even before the current craze, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was importing oats from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. Now the demand is greater than ever. It was only a few years ago that medical researchers found health benefits in foods rich in fiber. Combined with a reduction in the consumption of fats, they can help guard against colon cancers and high levels levels of serum cholesterol. Oats, long-recognized as a nutritious food, gained further dietary fame as researchers found that certain kinds of fiber _ those that are soluble in water _ are even more effective. `` If you cook oatmeal in a pan, you know how sticky it is and how difficult it is to clean,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> said. `` Well, that sticky product is the soluble fiber.'' Oat bran, which is extracted from the oat seed, is even more concentrated in fiber content. When farms were powered mostly by horses and mules _ a record of 25 million in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inventory in the early 1920s _ farmers grew more than 40 million acres of oats each year. As recently as 1954, oats were harvested from 40.6 million acres. But by the mid-1960s the crop was down to less than 20 million acres, and in the late 1970s dropped to below 10 million. Last year's drought cut the harvest to 5.6 million acres. This year's harvest rose to more than 6.8 million acres, primarily a result of improved weather in some key areas and relatively high market prices. A major reason for the slide in oats production, however, has been the federal crop program that makes barley and other grains more profitable to produce. Oats are grown in most states but are concentrated in the North Central region, including the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. Since 1982, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> economists <PERSON> Linwood </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Ash </PERSON>, government programs `` have created a competitive disadvantage for oats'' by assigning a common acreage base to oats and barley. Under the price support apparatus, farmers simply had a better financial deal with barley instead of oats. Finally, <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ash </PERSON> say in a recent analysis, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 set up the Conservation Reserve Program so that farmers could take erosion-prone land from crop production for 10 years. `` In many instances, this land was planted to oats prior to entry into the program,'' they said. Oats is not a kingpin crop in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> when compared with some others. In pre-drought 1987, for example, the value of oats production ranked 16th among major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> field crops at $ 606 million. By comparison, corn was $ 14 billion; soybeans, $ 11.3 billion; hay, $ 9 billion; and wheat, $ 5.5 billion. Despite the growth in supermarket products, oats is still basically a livestock feed grain, with only the higher-quality portion going to food processors. About 300 million bushels are expected to be used as feed in 1989-90, compared with around 110 million bushels as food and seed. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said oats prices averaged about $ 1.52 a bushel in the first five months of the crop's current marketing year, which began June 1. The average for the full 1988-89 marketing year was $ 2.61 a bushel, up from $ 1.56 in 1987-88, reflecting the drought-year market bulge. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is putting together new legislation to replace the 1985 farm law that expires next year. One of the items under review is the oats program and how more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production can be encouraged. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Senter </PERSON>, national director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, said the best way to avoid importing more oats `` is just to improve the program so that farmers can economically afford to grow'em'' again. <PERSON> Senter </PERSON> said that when the current farm law was designed in 1985 there was virtually no concern about oats. Lawmakers, he said, `` got caught up in writing programs'' for other crops and oats production `` did not receive the attention it should have.''

 <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Roeland </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> had a right to sing the blues. The thin, old man with the shy grin and the dark glasses known as Professor Longhair, or ` Fess' for short, had plenty of hard times _ songs sold for grocery money, music stolen, royalties not paid, gigs worked for peanuts. He also had a way of pounding it out on a piano that started feet moving, hearts thumping, fingers tapping and a whole bunch of musicians searching for a new way of making music. `` It was a swing-stride piano,'' said pianist <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Winston </PERSON>. `` He did it like no one else. He was influential on people who did n't even know he was influencing them. He influenced Fats Domino, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Toussaint </PERSON>, Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON>. He influenced people who influenced people who influenced people.'' Almost a decade after Professor <PERSON> Longhair </PERSON>'s death in 1980, <ORGANIZATION> Winston </ORGANIZATION>'s Dancing Cat label has re-released `` Rock N' Roll Gumbo,'' a Professor <PERSON> Longhair </PERSON> album originally released in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. `` <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Style </ORGANIZATION>,'' an LP recorded in 1971 and released in 1987, won a Grammy that year. `` I was on a plane from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> and they had this movie on called ` Dead Poets Society' and I could n't believe it,'' said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON>, the performer generally credited with carrying on Professor <PERSON> Longhair </PERSON>'s music to the greatest degree. `` Fess' ` Hey Little Girl' was on the soundtrack. I looked around the plane and there were people just grooving in their seats to the music and I said, ` Oh, yeah, how about this.''' Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Winston </ORGANIZATION> both performed regular benefits for Professor <PERSON> Longhair </PERSON>'s widow before her death in October. The benefits provided <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> with an income during the years after her husband's death. `` They were a wonderful way to help her. It was as if her husband was still taking care of her through his music. And, of course, it was a great way to celebrate the man and his music for everyone involved,'' said <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> <PERSON> Minor </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaslow </PERSON>, who managed the singer for the last years of his life and still administers Professor <ORGANIZATION> Longhair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` The man has been dead for 10 years and it's like he's still alive. I hear his music more now than ever,'' said <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkinson </PERSON>, editor of Wavelength, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> music magazine. She said his influence on rhythm and blues and rock, which was limited to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> for years, has been extended worldwide now, with his albums in constant demand in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` I do n't like the term cult because that has religious overtones, but that's about what it is. We call it the ` Fess Underground,''' said <PERSON> Kaslow </PERSON>. In 1950, `` Baldhead,'' Longhair's only recording to make the charts, was released by Mercury. Later that year he signed with <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, and in 1953 recorded `` Tipitina,'' which years later became one of his most famous songs. Initially, it had only local success and soon the song and the Professor were both forgotten. In 1971, <PERSON> Quinten </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kaslow </PERSON> were working on the second New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who had some of Professor <PERSON> Longhair </PERSON>'s old 45s and 78s, had hooked <PERSON> Kaslow </PERSON> on the music and they decided to try to get Longhair to perform. `` We heard he went into a record shop and <PERSON> Quint </PERSON> would drop in there all the time and ask for Fess. One day he went in and there he was sweeping the floor,'' <PERSON> Kaslow </PERSON> said. He had been supporting himself and his family at odd jobs and by gambling, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> recalled, and although he was physiclly in bad shape, he had not lost anything as a performer. `` When he went on stage at the Jazz Fest it was a real cliche. He started playing and all the musicians on the other stages quit playing and came to hear him,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` He was an old man, in bad shape when <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quint </PERSON> found him,'' <PERSON> Atkinson </PERSON> remembered. `` He could n't walk, could n't breath well, his teeth were gone, but the longer he played, the younger he got. The last time I saw him _ shortly before he died in 1980 _ he ran over and jumped up on the stage.'' Professor <PERSON> Longhair </PERSON> became a regular at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jazz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fest </ORGANIZATION>, and by the mid-1970s played festivals in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In 1976, he cut a new record, `` Live on the Queen <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>,'' at a party for <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON>, who was an admirer. Longhair and his band toured <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in 1979. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tipitina </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, a small bar near the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, became his regular home when he was not on the road. The bar, which featured live music nightly, has retained its reputation for rhythm and blues and jazz performances. A bust of the Fess sits near the entrance, and fans are trying to create a Longhair Park in the boulevard outside. In a city known for it's music, where distinctive styles produce a sound unique to the region, Professor <PERSON> Longhair </PERSON> was one of a kind. `` He was influenced by the blues, and Cuban rumba music and New Orleans Street music, but he went beyond all of those,'' <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> said. `` He's been labeled blues, but he never considered himself as playing one kind of music,'' Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> said. Professor <PERSON> Longhair </PERSON>, who developed his sense of rhythm through tap dancing as a young man, translated that to the piano with a boogie-woogie stride, and a sizzling left hand, then added calypso, merengue and rhumba beats to old-time <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> rhythm and blues and rock' n' roll. `` He came from <LOCATION> Bogalusa </LOCATION>, out in the country, so he did n't grow up with the usual <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> music background. He did n't read music. He listened to the Spanish, the brass bands, the African, the blues, all of it, and then put it together in his own way,'' <PERSON> Kaslow </PERSON> said. `` He had a wild and untamed way of playing. In the same way <PERSON> Bach </PERSON> had inventions, Professor <PERSON> Longhair </PERSON> had five or six inventions that changed the piano forever. You could build a life on any of them,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Toussaint </PERSON>. <PERSON> Toussaint </PERSON>, a prolific songwriter known for his funky piano and intricate arrangements, credits the professor for much of his style. `` I've loved him all my life and copied all of his recordings as much as I could. His influence is enormous. I hear it second, third, fourth hand on people who do n't even know he influenced them,'' he said. The `` Fess Underground'' shows every sign of growing and of going above ground. And Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> says there's a good reason the music will last: `` It was very hip in the'40s and'50s and'60s when he was writing it, and its very hip now. It will be hip a long time.''

 Few stars remain from <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s Golden Age. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gable </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> _ all long gone. The survivors _ <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Myrna </PERSON> <PERSON> Loy </PERSON> _ rarely make movies anymore. But one popular collection of screen idols has endured, looks undiminished by age: <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON>, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Duck </PERSON>, Goofy. How old are they? Only their illustrators know for sure. But they've been around more than 50 years, and should last at least 50 more. Their studio is intact as well. Hollywood's happiest endings still come from <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>. Nothing like a cartoon to stop time, and even pull it back a little. Only at <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> are glass slippers, handsome princes and magic wands accepted without reservation. The latest animated spectacular from the Disney machine is `` The Little Mermaid,'' a feature that's bound to generate more big bucks for the highly successful studio. Disney's last animated feature, `` <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> and Company,'' has grossed about $ 50 million. A re-release this year of `` Peter Pan'' has pulled in $ 30 million. Although <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> officials would n't disclose how much `` The Little Mermaid'' cost to make, those in the industry put it between $ 10 million and $ 15 million. Cynics better stay away from `` The Little Mermaid.'' They'll never believe this one, something about a beautiful, blue-eyed mermaid falling in love with a handsome prince, and goodness defeating the evil sea witch Of course, cynics would n't have sat through `` Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,'' `` Cinderella'' or `` Bambi,'' either. And as <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Katzenberg </PERSON> explained, `` The Little Mermaid'' takes a lot of its glitter from those golden oldies. `` I wanted us to make a film that had the look and feel and the entertainment and lushness of ` Pinocchio,''' he said in a recent interview. `` If you talk with writers, directors, animators, designers, effects people, layout artists _ across the board in this movie _ all the refreneces that I made, the goals I kept setting for them were, ` Ca n't we do something that is like ` Pinocchio.''' `` The Little Mermaid'' is rated, naturally, `` G,'' for general audiences. That's how <PERSON> Katzenberg </PERSON> sees it. Say the film is for children and he'll grimace, his eyes widening, the jaw stretching. Family entertainment means the entire family, he insists. `` They're fantastic stories, they're not children's stories. They're great stories and they're made for the kid inside everyone of us as opposed to made for children; there's a real distinction there. `` We try to make it very intelligent, very smart, very sophisticated. There is very little about the film that is cartoonish. Even when it's animal characters that are speaking, you'll notice it's very sophisticated.'' Ask about romance, action, drama, and <PERSON> Katzenberg </PERSON> will talk strategy, borrowing a page from film mogul <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwyn </PERSON>, who insisted the world needed laughter when his competitors were serious, and lamented the disappearance of `` messages'' when others turned out comedies. But animation belongs to Disney. Who would want to compete with `` The Ugly Ducking,'' `` <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Pan </PERSON>,'' `` Fantasia'' and dozens of others? It's a tradition <PERSON> Katzenberg </PERSON> would n't dream of touching, although a little retouching does n't hurt. For `` The Little Mermaid,'' based on the <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> story, that means the richest colors; the brightest melodies, courtesy of `` Little Shop of Horrors'' composer <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Menken </PERSON>; and the most vivid illustrations, often resembling the performers _ Buddy <PERSON> Hackett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> among them _ who provide the voices. Nothing is left to chance. Everyone has to rehearse, even mermaids. `` There's not a sequence in the film in which there are human characters not staged and shot on film and used as references in order to make sure that the human characters moved very much like people move. `` We built an eight-foot tank, put a lady in it and had her swim around a lot to get the sense of movement and hair _ how it moves through the water, and the sense of weightlessness.'' `` The Little Mermaid'' is just the beginning. <PERSON> Katzenberg </PERSON> talks of a `` renaissance'' for Disney animation. So get ready to see those ageless stars dusted off again. When the studio needed a lead for its version of `` The Prince and the Pauper,'' to be released late in 1990, <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON> got the call. <PERSON> Minnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON>, Goofy, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Duck </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Pluto </LOCATION> will co-star. Also in the works are `` Beauty and the Beast''; `` An Arabian Night,'' the story of <PERSON> Aladdin </PERSON> and his magic lamp; `` Swan Lake''; and `` King of the Jungle.'' And why bother with surveying the public. Numbers, box-office numbers, speak louder than words. Seeing is make-believing has always been <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s unofficial motto. `` I want people going out of this movie saying: ` God, I have n't been affected like this, I have n't seen anything like this for years, music that much fun and that much part of the movie,''' <PERSON> Katzenberg </PERSON> said `` It's a musical, it's a love story, it's emotional. You feel very sad for this girl who loses everything, happy for her at the end. What you're hoping to do is get a reaction. Each movie looks for something different; some make you laugh, some make you cry. Each one is a different thrill.''

 Wholesale prices rose 0.4 percent in October as the biggest spurt in food costs in 22 months offset the positive effects from moderating energy prices, the government reported. The 0.4 percent October rise in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Producer Price Index on Thursday was down from a 0.9 percent September increase. Some economists predicted the news will continue to improve in coming months as a slowing economy takes more pressure off prices. For the first 10 months of the year, prices at the wholesale level have been rising at an annual rate of 5.2 percent, compared to an increase of 4 percent in 1988.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has approved a smoking ban for nearly all domestic airline flights, a broadening of restrictions that signals a victory by health advocates over tobacco interests. The prohibition, fought strenuously earlier this year by the cigarette industry and lawmakers from tobacco states, was adopted on a voice vote Thursday with no comments by outnumbered opponents.

 The stock market pulled back Thursday after the rally of the two preceding sessions faltered amid worries about corporate earnings. The Dow Jones industrial average, which had risen more than 41 points Tuesday and Wednesday, dropped 19.67 to 2,603.69. The dollar rose against most major currencies except the Japanese yen and Canadian dollar. Bond prices finished slightly lower. Copper prices continued a surge; grain was mostly lower and soybeans higher; energy and sugar futures were higher; gold was off while silver gained; livestock and pork futures were mixed.

 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Governor <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Angell </PERSON> says the central bank needs to reduce inflation to about 3 percent in 1990 and he expects to meet that goal in the first half of the year. Inflation has been falling since the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> began tightening credit in 1988 to slow the economy. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> began easing credit in May and nudged short-term interest rates lower earlier this week. But <PERSON> Angell </PERSON>'s comments, made to reporters after a speech Thursday to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Certified </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accountants </ORGANIZATION>, appeared to indicate the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> might not be prepared to cut interest rates further in the immediate future. <PERSON> Angell </PERSON> told the accountants he supports a pending <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill that would mandate that the central bank eliminate inflation by 1994. <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> endorsed the proposal last month in an appearance before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Banking monetary policy subcommittee. Inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index had dropped to an annual rate of 4.3 percent by September, a level <PERSON> Angell </PERSON> told reporters still was too high. The bill calling for zero inflation was introduced by the monetary policy subcommittee chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N </LOCATION>. It does not include any penalty for failing to reach that level. It was supported at a subcommittee hearing Thursday by former <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> Gov. <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramley </PERSON>, who called it a `` desirable'' statement of priorities for monetary policy. He added, `` I would not hold out hope that its passage would greatly simplify the achievement of a noninflationary economy.'' The subcommittee also is considering a bill introduced by Reps. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., and <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>, designed to reduce the independence of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> That bill would require the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-setting Open Market Committeeto meet three times a year with the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary and the president's budget director and chief economic adviser, allow the president to appoint the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chairman a year after taking office, immediately disclose any changes in monetary policy targets, permit <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> audits of <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> operations and require publication of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> budget. The Hamilton-Dorgan bill has been criticized as `` politicizing'' the central bank but <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> described it at Thursday's hearing as a `` responsible way'' to make the independent <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> accountable to the public. <PERSON> Gramley </PERSON>, however, said he generally opposes the <LOCATION> Hamilton-Dorgan </LOCATION> bill because `` the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s independence from the administrative branch needs to be preserved.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobin </PERSON>, a Nobel laureate and economics professor at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, endorsed several of the <LOCATION> Hamilton-Dorgan </LOCATION> proposals including presidential appointment of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chairman a year after taking office. <PERSON> Tobin </PERSON> said he would expand administration participation in <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policy-making to all meetings of the Open Market Committee. But he rejected mandating immediate announcement of policy decisions and said terms of the central bank governors should be reduced from 14 years to 10, and board membership cut from seven to five. <PERSON> Tobin </PERSON> also recommended that the president name the heads of the district <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> banks, subject to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation. The district presidents now are selected by the directors of the member banks, subject to approval by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> governors, and alternate as members of the Open Market Committee.

<HEAD>Administration Rejects Price-Support Boost For Barley, Oats</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIP BRASHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has rejected as too costly proposals to boost government price supports for barley and oats, which have been in declining production despite increased consumer demand. Health concerns have triggered consumer demand for cereal grains, particulary for oat products, including oatmeal, bran and flour. As a result of smaller harvests in recent years, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has had to import oats from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and other foreign suppliers to meet demand. Bills <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is considering would cost the government $ 130 million in higher payments for barley and an additional, unspecified amount for oats, said <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Bjerke </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Selected increases in target prices for barley and oats could `` lead to detrimental effects for producers and consumers of other program crops and lead to expanded federal outlays,'' <PERSON> Bjerke </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. Target prices are goals set in the government's crop programs to help determine direct subsidies to farmers when market prices are down. <PERSON> Bjerke </PERSON> said Thursday the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is taking some steps to stimulate oats production, which has not kept pace with the demand generated by the grain's reported health benefits, forcing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to import nearly 30 percent of its production. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should wait to change target prices until it rewrites the government's multiyear farm program next year, <PERSON> Bjerke </PERSON> said. Producers claim subsidies for barley and oats are relatively low in comparison to price supports for wheat, corn and sorghum. The cost of producing barley and oats actually exceeds the price farmers can get, one economist testified. `` Farmers have had strong incentives to produce crops that have high target prices relative to costs,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Abel </PERSON>, who represented the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION>. `` Conversely, they have had much less incentive to produce crops with low target prices relative to costs, namely barley and oats.'' The subsidy for barley is too low because the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> calculates it by combining the market prices for malting barley and feed barley, which brings up to 50 cents less per bushel, producers say. Lagging oats production is blamed both on low target prices and planting restrictions in the farm program that discourage farmers from switching to oats from other crops. In addition, the Conservation Reserve Program, which pays farmers not to plant crops on highly erodible land, has taken a disproportionate amount of oats acerage out of production, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bollingberg </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Bremen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, farmer representing the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imported 60 million bushels of oats, or 28 percent of its production, last year during the drought, he said in testimony prepared for the committee. While <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oat production is expected to rebound slightly this year, imports are still expected to reach 40 million bushels, he said. The government does not expect to make any deficiency payments for oats next year because market prices are expected to be higher than the $ 1.45 target price, <PERSON> Bjerke </PERSON> said.

 Police on Thursday charged 10 men and two leading British investment firms with fraud in a $ 1.3 billion stock sale connected with <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arrow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>'s takeover of <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manpower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> two years ago. The British employment-service company's takeover of the much larger Manpower, which has its headquarters in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, created the world's largest temporary employment company. The charges apparently are related to the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natwest </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to properly disclose a 13.4 percent Blue Arrow holding it was left with after a sale of Blue Arrow shares flopped. County <PERSON> Natwest </PERSON> helped arrange the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arrow </ORGANIZATION> shares to existing <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arrow </ORGANIZATION> shareholders to finance the takeover of Manpower. The 10 defendants were charged with conspiracy to defraud and were to appear before City of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Magistrates Court today, police said. An unspecified number of them were arrested Thursday and later released. The City of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> is the city's financial district. The investment firms <ORGANIZATION> Natwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> UBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Drew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> also were charged with conspiracy to defraud, as well as with conspiracy to contravene Section 13 of the Prevention of Fraud -LRB- Investments -RRB- Act 1958, police said. <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Natwest </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> UBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> and Drew officials declined comment. The police, and the Serious Fraud Squad, a central governmental unit charged with investigating financial crime, have been conducting an investigation into the case, which is known as the Blue Arrow affair. The investigation began after the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> released a report in July on events related to the sale of Blue Arrow shares. The report severely criticized <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, its <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natwest </ORGANIZATION> unit and <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Switzerland </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> UBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> and Drew for their conduct. When the $ 1.3 billion sale of <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arrow </ORGANIZATION> shares failed, <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natwest </ORGANIZATION> did n't disclose its 13.4-percent stake in Blue Arrow for three months, in apparent violation of British regulations. A series of top-level resignations followed publication of the trade department's report, including the chairman of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION>, Lord <PERSON> Boardman </PERSON>, and three of his main board directors. Those charged Thursday from <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Natwest </LOCATION> were: <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Villiers </PERSON>, former chairman; <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, former chief executive; <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, current financial director; <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, former executive director, in charge of the corporate advisory department; and <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, formerly a senior director in that department. Those charged from <ORGANIZATION> UBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> were: <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Stainforth </PERSON>, former executive director of corporate finance; <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON>, former director of corporate director of finance; and <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Smallwood </PERSON>, directors in the firm's equity sales division.

 Investment company executives agree that computer-driven program trading helps fuel wild swings in the stock market, but they're split on what <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should do about it. Former Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel Thursday that a bill to limit computer-driven stock trading does n't go far enough and suggested a ban on one form of the market strategy He targeted index arbitrage, in which speculators try to take advantage of inconsistencies between the stock and futures markets by simultaneously buying in one while selling in the other. Critics claim index arbitrage widens stock price swings and drives small investors out of the market. `` There is no good index arbitrage effect upon the market. The volatility up is just as bad as the volatility down,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, an executive vice president with <ORGANIZATION> USAA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the telecommunications and finance subcommittee, plans to introduce legislation to restrict program trading during times of extreme market turbulence But <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, the former head of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` This is more of a partial solution to the problem and, if enacted, may not cure it.'' He said the problem was stock index futures _ futures contracts tied to the performance of large groups of stocks _ which have `` commoditized our stock market.'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> suggested doing away with the commodity aspects of index futures `` in order to lessen volatility, or we should make the stock market derivatives have the same rules as stocks.'' The panel members agreed that market volatility scares investors out of the market and that makes it harder for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies to raise capital through the sale of stock. And if you do that, said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Zicklin </PERSON>, managing partner of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> invesment firm <ORGANIZATION> Neuberger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, `` you reduce their ability to compete'' with foreign corporations. Most of Wall Street's large investment houses recently have revised their policies on index arbitrage. And the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> has called on large, institutional investors to curb program trading while ways to handle the bursts of stock orders it generates are considered. But money managers who oversee pension funds and other institutional investors, who do not belong to the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, said they would continue to use index arbitrage. <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>'s plan would grant emergency powers to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to temporarily halt program trading during extreme market turbulence. <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> is seeking to amend the Stock Market Reform Act of 1989, which is pending before the subcommittee. That bill calls for giving the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> authority to halt trading in market emergencies; requiring reports of large securities and options trades; and rules for assessing the financial stability of the parent companies of broker-dealers. <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> said the subcommittee would vote Tuesday on passing the bill along to the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. A similar bill that has no program trading ban is pending in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Purcell </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the real problem is volatility, not program trading. Although his firm has halted index arbitrage for customer accounts, <PERSON> Purcell </PERSON> said, `` The public should recognize that any steps taken to curb program trading will not cure volatility.''

<HEAD>NYSE President: Exchanges Looking at Possible Program Trading Abuses</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> has begun `` major investigations'' into potential violations involving computerized stock trading strategies, exchange President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> announced. <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> said Thursday the probe involves trading in both the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> securities and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> futures exchanges and focuses on an illegal financial market strategy called `` front-running.'' After a speech to corporate investor relations officials, <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> also said he was not concerned about reports that large institutions have not scaled back their program trading despite a <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> request for voluntary restraint. The exchange Thursday also defended its method for measuring the amount of monthly program trading after Business Week magazine asserted the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> calculation erroneously doubles the figure. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> last month instituted a series of reforms amid a growing outrcy by some securities firms and lawmakers that a computerized trading strategy known as index arbitrage had made the market more volatile. <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> and other regulators were examining the possibility of `` front-running'' or other manipulative tactics in the program trading strategy known as index arbitrage. In front-running, a broker buys or sells stocks or futures for its own account ahead of a customer's order, using the knowledge that the customer order is likely to affect prices in the market. Exchange officials confirmed that the study includes the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Officials are looking at sharp price swings in the market last July that may be related to program trading. `` There's a lot of concern that the type of trading actually going on creates a lot of opportunity for abuse,'' <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamsin </PERSON> said. `` We have not necessarily identified specific situations we are looking at.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> defines program trading as any order for the simultaneous purchase or sale of 15 or more stocks valued at more than $ 1 million. Index arbitrage involves rapid trading of stocks and stock-index futures traded in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to profit from momentary price discrepancies between the two. Index arbitrage defenders say the strategy helps stabilize trading by linking the two markets, pulling prices closer together. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Markovitz </PERSON>, an stock-index futures trader at the commodities firm <ORGANIZATION> Mercury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said possible program trading manipulation should not be used as another excuse to criticize the strategy. `` When you put poison in a cup of cocoa you do n't ban the cocoa, you ban the poison,'' he said. Business Week contends in its Nov. 20 issue, released Thursday to the media, that the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s method of calculating program trading volume exaggerates the total. The <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> divides program stock sales and purchases by total volume, whereas trading by specialists is divided by twice the total volume. <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrenzano </PERSON> said the calculation accounts for differences in the two types of trading. He said the exchange has made public its methodology monthly since it began calculating program trading volume in July 1988. `` The numbers we have published for the last 18 months are correct,'' <PERSON> Torrenzano </PERSON> said. `` It appears Business Week does n't like the methodolgy we use. That does n't make the numbers wrong.'' Among its reforms, the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> requested that its member firms ask customers to refrain from all types of program trading unless it would have a `` stabilizing influence in the market;'' installed slowdowns when the market declines rapidly; and limited access of program trades to the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s computerized order system. But market players said that large institutions show no signs of abating their program trading. Stock-index funds such as <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> are among the largest stock-index arbitrage clients on Wall Street. <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> said he is not yet concerned because the voluntary pullbacks were designed for periods of volatility. `` We're just trying to get in in,'' <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> said after a speech to the National Investor Relations Institute. `` We have n't hit those periods of market illiquidity we talked about.'' The impact of the battle over program trading should become noticeable within two weeks, when the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> issues its first weekly report on total program trading activity. Until now, the exchange issued monthly figures. Debate over program trading intensified after the Oct. 13 190-point market drop and a rapid 80-point rise on Oct. 24. Major Wall Street brokerages dropped index arbitrage and investors and corporations lashed out at the strategy as scaring away individual investors. <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> said he supports legislation to help control volatility but slowing the market down is preferable to banning program trading _ which only <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could do. `` There are millions of gallons of alcoholic beverages produced in this country. That does n't mean you have to be sloshed every day,'' he said.

Joining <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> as hosts will be multimillionaire developer <PERSON> Trammell </PERSON> <PERSON> Crow </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON>. On Saturday, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who is in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on a political visit, will tour a <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> store in an upscale north <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> mall it anchors along with such stores as <ORGANIZATION> Neiman-Marcus </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. The `` Festival of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>'' is the latest international promotion for <PERSON> Penney </PERSON>. Such events are becoming annual affairs for the company, with previous promotions centering on <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. The Filipino promotion also reflects the new emphasis at <LOCATION> Penney </LOCATION>: apparel and soft home furnishings. In 1983, <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> began eliminating automotive, electronics and hard goods from its stores, a decision that cost $ 1.5 billion in revenue, <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> said, but put the company `` more in sync with what <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> consumers expect at J.C. <PERSON> Penney </PERSON>'s.'' `` <PERSON> J.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> is truly positioned as the middle income department store of the country,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tashjian </PERSON>, a retail analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Seidler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amdec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` The company is the largest occupant of mall space in the country and what it has done is it has adjusted its merchandising strategy to serve that mall customer,'' who is mainly female and mainly looking for clothes, <PERSON> Tashjian </PERSON> said. Although founder <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cash </PERSON> <PERSON> Penney </PERSON>'s original Golden Rule stores focused on soft goods, `` they had taken a detour for a time into hard goods ... when they saw <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> being very successful in hard goods,'' <PERSON> Tashjian </PERSON> said. Apparel now accounts for 82 percent of <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> sales, with women's apparel at 42 percent of total sales. In 1981, apparel was 63 percent, with women's at 30 percent. Home and leisure goods have fallen from 37 percent in 1981 to 18 percent last year. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> has predicted that by 1993, overall apparel sales will make up 72 percent of total sales. Despite an industry-wide slump in apparel sales, <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> sales so far this year have rebounded to $ 10.13 billion through Oct. 28, an 8.2 percent increase from the same time last year. With the busy holiday season upcoming, the company already has reached 68 percent of last year's retail sales, and 66 percent of its record 1987 sales. And when third-quarter earnings are released Tuesday, `` I do n't think we're going to disappoint anybody,'' <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> said in an interview this week at the company's temporary headquarters in <LOCATION> Addison </LOCATION>, a corporate suburb on <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'s northern border to which it moved from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> last year before it settles in nearby <LOCATION> Plano </LOCATION> Analysts are looking for earnings of $ 1.40 to $ 1.50 per share compared with last year's $ 1.16. `` They're doing very well,'' said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, a retail analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Last year they were cleaning out the store of merchandise they did n't want, and this year they're filling it up with merchandise they want.'' Led by <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, analysts said, <PERSON> Penney </PERSON>'s management has become aggressive and pays more attention to market research than some of its competitors. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> frequently recites those findings in explaining his company's operations. `` We're going to change, because the American consumer is going to change,'' he said. But he believes <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> already is ahead of its competition in the race for future sales. `` We have faith that we have a competitive advantage, that <PERSON> J.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> will be one of the survivors, with a triple threat of retail, catalog and television,'' <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> said. While about 80 percent of <PERSON> Penney </PERSON>'s sales come from in-store purchases, its <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> on cable TV presents well-known celebrities hawking <PERSON> J.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> products. Its shop-by-mail catalog provides the rest of its sales.

<HEAD>Luxury Train Completes Inaugural Run</HEAD>

 The nation's first luxury passenger train in decades rolled into town three minutes late, but its owner said the enterprise would n't leave him a dollar short. `` This is kind of like the country club without the golf course,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Spann </PERSON>. `` If this does n't work, the message will be loud and clear: Americans do n't care how they travel. I bet a considerable sum of money they do.'' The American-European Express completed its 17-hour inaugural run to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, on Thursday. The fur - and silk-clad guests rode in grand style by invitation, but regular passengers will pay a grand and more for the privilege of sinking into overstuffed chairs in the lush club car and tucking in seven-course meals served from plates that ring when flicked with a manicured fingernail <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON>, associate editor of Trains Magazine and an expert on passenger-train travel, said the American-European Express may prove to be a financial success. `` It's ... an exciting prospect for people traveling by train in the grand manner,'' he said in an interview from <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>. `` It harkens back to a time when traveling on a long-distance train.. was an experience to be savored.'' He added: `` It's much fancier than what you get on <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>.'' A jazz band blared `` Chattanooga Choo-Choo'' as the guests disembarked at Union Station. Most seemed suitably impressed. `` Instead of the hurry-itis we usually have, I feel like I've been on a little vacation,'' said <PERSON> North </PERSON> <PERSON> Carolinian </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> McElveen-Hunter </PERSON> as she clutched her full-length fur to shield her from a chilling <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> wind `` It's a return to yesteryear. We need that.'' `` This was the perfect opportunity to do something different,'' said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeley </PERSON>. `` It was a European travel experience,'' said his wife, <PERSON> Regina </PERSON>, who nonetheless acknowledged, `` putting on mascara was kind of difficult.'' American-European Express will run two five-car trains between <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ one going each way _ six days a week. The first regular run will be Wednesday. Most of its rail cars were built in the 1940s and'50s, many by the <ORGANIZATION> Pullman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The interior decorating is anything but plebeian. Pianist <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> will play requests on the grand piano in the Art Deco-inspired club car, where the brass window trim is complemented by `` faux tortoise'' leather wainscoting. Dinner is served on fine china with damask table linens. As could be expected, luxury travel does n't come cheap. A double-occupancy fare runs about $ 1,042, while booking the train's Presidential Cabin will cost $ 1,450 The fancy trains will be pulled behind <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> trains for a `` fancy fee'' _ an example of <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>'s creativity in raising money, <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Spann </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> American-European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> invested about $ 1 million per car in refurbishing but expects to turn a profit. `` We have 26 rooms with an average price of $ 1,000,'' he said. `` On an average night, what you really want to achieve is somewhere between $ 18,000 and $ 24,000 in sales. If you do that, you can pay for this investment.'' <PERSON> Spann </PERSON> said there are still a few wrinkles to iron out. `` There's no Kleenex in the rooms,'' he reflected. `` You spend millions of dollars and forget the Kleenex.''

<HEAD>Wang Announces `Reordering,' Layoff of 2,000</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The high-technology industry is taking another hit with the announcement by <ORGANIZATION> Wang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> that it will cut 2,000 jobs in an effort to restore profitability. President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> announced the move Thursday, saying the computer industry has lost its boom, forcing the company to undergo a `` fundamental reordering'' and pay more attention to its customers. But analysts, who welcomed the change, said <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> has contributed to many of its problems and that bolder steps are necessary to make the company more competitive. `` This is a necessary but not a sufficient step,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Willman </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Sanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bernstein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Inc The cutback was the latest sign of a high-tech industry slowdown that has contributed to a softening of the economy. `` Some fundamental things are happening that will drive all -LRB- computer -RRB- companies to do things differently or they will fail,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. Prior to Thursday's announcement, the company already had cut about 5,000 jobs this year and announced plans to sell $ 200 million in assets. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> posted a loss of $ 62.1 million in the first quarter that ended Sept. 30, and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> predicted more losses for the second quarter. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was appointed president of <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> in August, succeeding <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, who had been ousted from the job by <PERSON> An </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, his father, company founder and chairman. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said under the company's new approach, <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> will cut its bureaucracy to get in closer touch with the needs of its customers. `` We are eliminating the layers between the field and laboratory,'' he said. `` We will eliminate entire functions _ functions that I view as stifling.'' For example, he said, the company's product development programs often duplicate efforts, with no single group taking responsibility. As a result, products often have been introduced late. The reorganization of the company will mean the loss of about 2,000 jobs by Jan. 1, lowering the Wang workforce to just over 22,000, he said. About 1,000 of the layoffs will occur in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, mostly at the company's headquarters in <LOCATION> Lowell </LOCATION>, with the rest scattered around the world. A severance package for these employees will result in a one-time charge of $ 30 million in the company's second quarter, which ends Dec. 31. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the restructuring announced Thursday would cut annual costs by about $ 115 million, but he stressed that the company was not simply calculating how much needed to be cut in order to be profitable. The high-tech industry recently has suffered other setbacks. <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced last month it would eliminate 2,200 jobs, and <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> recently offered voluntary severance to 700 workers. `` I think restructuring is becoming a common word in this industry,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said much of <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>'s bureaucracy grew while the high-tech industry was booming. But now the industry has reached a `` maturing'' stage with slower growth, he said. The bureaucracy `` just built up because of the luxury of very big margins in a high growth industry,'' he said. But while <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> pointed to the fluctuations in the computer industry for many of his company's problems, analysts said some of the trouble _ particularly poor customer service _ has been unique to <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>. `` They have had this problem with service and support for a long time,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Wendler </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Gartner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> is a breath of fresh air.'' Also, <PERSON> Wendler </PERSON> said, after the company completes the cost-cutting measures, `` the hemorrhaging, financially, will stop.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Elling </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said during the 1970s and early 1980s, <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> did not pay attention to customer service because it became confident as a leader in word processing equipment. `` They had something everyone wanted,'' he said. `` People were willing to put up with poorer service.'' `` <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> was too slow to recognize they needed to change,'' he said, noting that other companies have adapted better to new product demands. Part of the change, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said, will include more focus on software and other computer applications. `` Most customers are not crying for new technology,'' he said. `` They are crying for new applications of technology.''

<TEXT>
 A five-year plan for <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> calls for aggressive moves to grab more of the convenience food market and the possible sale of some food subsidiaries, the company's interim management team says. `` Business is an evolving thing,'' said <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>, who serves with <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Baum </PERSON> as executive vice president. `` There are some assets we do n't really need.'' <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> owns <ORGANIZATION> Pepperidge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Vlasic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s Kitchens, <PERSON> Godiva </PERSON> <PERSON> Chocolatier </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Casera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> `` Some businesses in my opinion are near the borderline,'' <PERSON> Baum </PERSON> added during a news conference here Thursday, the two officials' first since being named to oversee <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>'s day-to-day operations Nov. 1 Convenience-food marketing and plant-modernization will require a $ 2 billion investment over the next five years, they said. <PERSON> Baum </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> took over temporarily for <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>, the company's president and chief executive, who stepped down after nine years. <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>'s board had been unhappy with the company's performance in recent years, and there had been rumors that it might be sold Both <PERSON> Baum </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> are candidates to succeed <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baum </PERSON> said board Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlasic </PERSON> has indicated the selection process would be completed by early next year.

<HEAD>FAA Expands Scope of Inspections For Cracking on 747's</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has directed airlines to expand inspections for possible cracks on all models of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 airliners with 15,500 or more flights. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said in an emergency airworthiness directive that an airline conducting a more limited inspection ordered last week found `` multiple longitudinal skin cracks'' outside the specified area. `` This new information indicates that the inspection requirements of -LRB- the previous directive -RRB- must be extended to detect all cracks. Such cracking, if not detected, could result in rapid decompression of the airplane,'' said the directive, issued by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Region </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> on Thursday. The new inspection, by visual and electronic methods, includes all of the nose section back to the passenger door, said <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Reese </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>. The directive also expands the number of planes that must be inspected to include 123 planes worldwide and 59 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The planes are from among the first 430 747s to roll off <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> production line, starting in 1968. Some 300 more 747's eventually will have to be inspected once they reach the 15,500-flight milestone, or roughly three-fourths of the plane's design life. The original directive, issued Nov. 2, ordered airlines to inspect only an area of the upper part of the cockpit for minute cracks, and applied to the 92 oldest <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747s. The first directive also had excluded planes that had been modified to help prevent cracking, but <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> said cracks between 0.1 and 0.25 inches in length were found in at least one 747 that had been modified. The modifications were begun in 1986 under <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s aging aircraft program and included the replacement of the old aluminum skin with a new aluminum alloy and reinforcement of the area. `` We're concerned about any cracking and if additional cracking is found we'll expand the number of planes we're looking at,'' <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> said. The inspections are to be made within 30 days, with any repairs to be made before further flight is allowed. The order means that any 747s already inspected following the Nov. 2 directive will have to be reinspected. Both directives were prompted by the discovery of 28 cracks found on Sept. 27 in the front section of a 747-400 cargo freighter owned by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Judge Approves $2.35 Million Pan Am Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge has approved a $ 2.35 million settlement for 117 female flight attendants who sued <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> for using stricter weight standards for them than for men. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thelton </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said Thursday that the settlement was fundamentally fair and highly favorable to the attendants despite objections from six women whose damage claims were fully or partially denied. The settlement will be shared by 117 women who were suspended, fired or denied promotions because of the weight policy, said <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, an attorney for the Independent Union of Flight Attendants. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> also agreed to liberalize weight standards for current or future employees. The former policy used a 1959 insurance company table of heights and weights, but judged men under the standard for large frames and women under the standard for medium frames. A 5-foot-7 woman was allowed to weigh 139 pounds under the medium standard, but would have been allowed to weigh 150 under the large standard. The flight attendants' union sued <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> in 1984, and won a ruling from <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> three years later in a non-jury trial that the policy was biased. The ruling was the first to find discrimination by an airline that had weight policies for both men and women, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoolman </PERSON> said at the time. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> ordered the airline to use a large-frame standard for all employees hired while the policy was in effect, through the end of 1984. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> appealed <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>'s ruling, denying it had discriminated. The appeal is being dropped as part of the settlement, without any admission of discrimination. The settlement retains <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>'s previous order on weight standards and also increases some of the standards adopted by the airline in 1985, when it started setting weight requirements according to an employee's individual build. In addition, women hired after 1985 get another three-pound allowance at ages 35, 45 and 55. Although $ 2.5 million was less than the women might have gotten in individual damage claims, <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said it was reasonable in light of the time an appeal would have taken and the risk that the entire amount would have been thrown out on appeal.

 Talks are underway between the city and <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to try to persuade the company not to move 3,000 jobs to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. `` I think we've made perfectly clear that <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> is a very important corporation here in the city of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and that we will make available our entire array of people and resources to keep them in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grayson </PERSON>, the deputy mayor for finance and economic development.

Chemical officials have been studying various options for 18 months, including a new building in nearby <LOCATION> Secaucus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Salmans </PERSON>, a bank spokesman. `` For some of our staff we have examined <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> sites as well as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> sites,'' he said. The city has battled recently to keep companies such as <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> in the city. Earlier this year, <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> announced it would move 2,500 back-office employees to <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said it would move 300 employees from its <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> headquarters to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. In an Oct. 25 letter to city officials, <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> senior vice president <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> said the bank has enjoyed below-market rents, but would face `` an extraordinary increase in expenses'' if it wanted to renew. `` Consequently, a plan has been developed which retains a small ` flagship' headquarters facility in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> containing staff who have an absolute need to be located there,'' the letter said. `` All other staff would be located in a second facility in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Salmans </PERSON> said the letter was written in response to a request from city officials for `` a listing of all of the areas of the bank that might potentially be relocated to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>.'' The list adds up to about 3,000 of the 4,700 employees at the two sites, <PERSON> Salmans </PERSON> said. `` No decisions have been taken, but we did reach a point where we needed to get an understanding from officials of the city of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for what incentives might be available to us to factor into how we looked at the cost of various alternatives,'' <PERSON> Salmans </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Grayson </PERSON> said Chemical officials have indicated a willingness to move operations to a borough outside <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. The bank also has discussed a non-binding option with <ORGANIZATION> Hartz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> to construct in <LOCATION> Secaucus </LOCATION> a building of a million square feet or more, <PERSON> Salmans </PERSON> said. The state and city put together a $ 235 million package last year to keep Chase from moving 5,000 jobs to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. Asked if Chemical might expect a similar deal, <PERSON> Grayson </PERSON> said, `` I do n't believe that is a responsible way for us to act, where the last deal becomes a starting point for the next deal. With discussion with firms, I think they very much understand that.'' He said the final package would depend on the site chosen and `` what's in the best interest of the city.''

<HEAD>Dividend Outlook Dims As Profits Lag</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If corporate profits keep lagging the way they have in the last few months, many Wall Street analysts say they will soon slow the rapid growth of dividends. Spurred on by the earnings boom of 1988 and early 1989, dividend payments by the 500 companies in <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500-stock composite index are expected to show an increase of 13 percent this year. That would rank as by far the strongest showing of this decade, just about tripling the current rate of inflation. But in 1990, <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P analysts project that the rate of dividend increases will drop back to the 5 percent to 6 percent range. `` Dividend hikes, a strongly supportive market influence this year, will be less of a factor next year,'' S & amp; P said in its weekly publication The Outlook. For much of the 1980s, dividends have been consigned to a supporting role in the story of the market's ups and downs. Capital gains have been the dominant theme in a bull market where prices of many stocks chalked up gains of 200 percent, 300 percent or more. Companies that found themselves with buildups of cash they could have devoted to dividend increases often opted for a different course _ using the money to buy back chunks of their stock. But the crash of 1987 and this year's October massacre have apparently helped inspire a revival of enthusiasm for dividends as a sort of stabilizing influence in periods of uncertainty. In the weeks immediately following the 190-point of the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average on Oct. 13 of this year, dividend-paying stocks outperformed those without dividends by close to 2 to 1, according to <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Barthel </PERSON>, analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Hopper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soliday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Dividends have always mattered to long-term investors hoping to benefit from rising income -LRB- and hence inflation protection -RRB- on their investment, or from participation in dividend reinvestment plans for growth Furthermore, dividends have gained a new status in the last couple of years since tax reform did away with special breaks for long-term capital gains, leaving both types of income subject to the same tax rates. The trend in dividends, of course, is always heavily dependent on which way corporate profits are headed. Lately, many Wall Street estimates of 1990 earnings have been cut back after a disappointing crop of reports for this year's third quarter and early indications that the fourth quarter will also be weak But analysts' opinions remain sharply divided over how long and how severe the earnings slump will be. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, investment strategist at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, contends that it probably will have run its course by the middle of next year. `` We still expect profits to resume an upward path in the second half of 1990 as inflation continues to subside, short-term interest rates decline, and money supply growth, which has returned to an expansionary level, makes itself felt in aggregate demand,'' <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> says. On that score, analysts say, lower interest rates would be helpful for the market outlook in a couple of important ways. First of all, they would stand to bolster prospects for earnings and dividends by stimulating business activity. Secondly, they would make dividend yields of stocks more attractive by comparison with returns available on interest-bearing investments.

<HEAD>Delay in Raising Debt Ceiling Had Little Impact on Bond Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Though news stories on the delay in raising the federal debt limit last week had an apocalyptic tone, the congressional procrastination caused little trouble in the bond market and no long-term damage, experts say. `` I think it's overblown,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Kemper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The delay in hiking the ceiling on the amount of money the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> may raise meant investors could n't buy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> savings bonds for a week. It also meant state and local governments could n't buy the special <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities they use to stash away proceeds from bond sales. In addition, the debt-ceiling problem posed the threat of depressing the bond market, since it compressed the sale of $ 30 billion in <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> notes and bonds into a shorter-than-usual time frame. Without the usual time period for `` when-issued'' trading in the securities _ the trading of securities that goes on before they are actually issued _ some experts said the new <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues might have had to offer higher yields to attract enough buyers. When bond yields rise, their prices fall. But a countervailing force on bond prices was a move by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> last week to ease interest rates, analysts said. An auction of $ 10 billion in three-year notes Thursday seemed to disprove the experts, with the notes selling at an average yield of 7.77 percent, the lowest for three-year notes since Feb. 2, 1988. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> scheduled an auction of $ 10 billion in 10-year notes for Monday and $ 10 billion in 30-year bonds for Tuesday. The impact on the bond market from the delay in raising the debt limit should be short-term, experts said. `` We're really talking about the timing of the bond calendar in a month,'' <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> said. Though the sale of some <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities was delayed, the same total amount will be available in the month, he noted. Had <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> delayed a few more days in approving an increase in the debt limit, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> may have had to put off the redemption of bills that matured last Thursday. It also could have forced the government to delay the issuance of certain checks, such as those to Social Security recipients. But once <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> agreed to raise the debt limit and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed the bill Wednesday, things began to get back to normal in the credit markets. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyerhardt </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s savings bond division, said investors could n't buy the bonds from Nov. 1 to last Wednesday while the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> was barred from raising more money. `` We did get lots of calls from people and banks saying ` What's going on?' <PERSON> Meyerhardt </PERSON> said. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> wo n't know until the end of the month how the 5 -LCB- business days during which savings bonds were n't sold will affect sales of these popular investments. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> sells anywhere from $ 15 million to $ 32 million worth of savings bonds a day, he said. `` Whether or not people decided not to buy because of this, there's no way for us to tell,'' he said. People who buy savings bonds through a payroll deduction plan should see little or no effect from the delay in bond sales, <PERSON> Meyerhardt </PERSON> said, since typically it takes up to a week for an employer to get the bonds issued in normal times. There were reports that some state and local governments delayed bond sales because they could n't buy the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s State and Local Government Series bonds, or `` slugs,'' during the debt-ceiling delay. When states and municipalities sell a bond issue, they typically do n't need all of the proceeds at once. The unneeded portion is invested in the slugs. Government bond issuers are barred from putting bond proceeds into normal investments, such as certificates of deposit, that would result in them earning higher interest rates than allowed by federal laws. Since they are non-profit entities, these laws bar them from making money off the proceeds of bond sales.

<HEAD>Economists Say Recent Layoffs Don't Presage Recession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TED DUNCOMBE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Economists say a recent wave of layoffs at major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies reflects sluggishness rather than an imminent, severe shakeout in the nation's economy. <ORGANIZATION> Wang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> have announced major layoffs in recent days. But <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, sees evidence of only a slowdown `` I'm yet to be convinced that that slowdown is going to lead to a recession,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. Many agree, at least for the near future. Only a third of 50 economists surveyed by <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indicators </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Sedona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, see a recession starting by the end of 1990. Another third see one in 1991 and the rest do n't predict a recession until 1992 or beyond. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, a labor economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based business group, sees the layoffs as part of a continuum over the past 6 -LCB- years. `` Overall the number of layoffs does n't seem to have significantly increased,'' he said. `` What is unusual during the last six or eight months is the number of layoffs that have been highly publicized.'' <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> attributes the publicity to nervousness about the economy, a feeling he says that is `` not just limited to the investment community.'' An organized-labor economist who is among the nervous said layoffs must be considered in re-examining trade and technology policies. `` It's an economic problem in that we're losing a lot of production and the associated earnings and income,'' said <PERSON> Markley </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` And then in addition, you have the tremendous dislocation ... that produces a whole lot of human costs in terms of health and family.'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> is concerned about recent signs from layoffs. `` Purists would say you've got to wait for more numbers to come in, but I feel certain we're on the verge of a slowdown or recession,'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said. Historically, manufacturing is among the first sectors of the economy hit during a downturn, but the past few years have left the economy on a high plateau that can withstand some blows, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. Unemployment in October and September was 5.3 percent, up from 5.1 percent in August but down from 5.4 percent in August 1988, according to the federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>. The latest unemployment report showed a decline in manufacturing jobs for the seventh straight month but a sharp increase in local and state government hiring as well as in health services. Employment in business services, finance and real estate was up slightly or flat. Recent layoffs have been concentrated in a few industries, notably auto manufacturing, computers and financial services. But they also have affected such far-flung companies as aerospace and equipment supplier <ORGANIZATION> Trinova </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Maumee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, with 1,500 employees let go; the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, which closed, eliminating 831 jobs; and the <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> airline, which could lay off up to 2,700 employees due to its financial troubles. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Baatz </PERSON>, a senior economist at <ORGANIZATION> Cahners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, says the layoffs and voluntary severances in the electronics industry _ including computer and office and communications equipment makers _ do not indicate `` horrible times ahead.'' Electronics companies have held down on hiring even though production has climbed sharply since the industry's 1985-86 recession, so they do not have many extra employees, she said. In fact, employment remains below the 1984 peak. <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrlich </PERSON>, vice president for economic analysis for <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>, says the computer industry is a victim of its success in making smaller, more powerful and less expensive equipment. It takes fewer people to build and maintain the new machines. The result, he said, is `` the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> computer industry is not at a precipice. The layoffs are a harsh human toll, but the layoffs do n't indicate that the industry is mature or that it's being beaten by an influx of foreign machines.''

<HEAD>Remy Martin, Cointreau Plan Merger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The family-held French spirits groups <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Remy </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and Cie. and <ORGANIZATION> Cointreau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> said Friday they plan to merge in a deal that will give them a competitive boost against foreign giants in the beverage market. The move is aimed at creating a `` premium French spirits group ... drawing on the synergies between the two companies while respecting the identity of each one,'' the companies said in a joint statement. The merger would create a company with annual revenue of more than 6 billion francs, or about $ 1 billion, the companies said. The plan is to unite <PERSON> Remy </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s cognac, champagne and premium wine holdings under the same umbrella as <PERSON> Cointreau </PERSON>'s liqueur, armagnac, rum, fruit juice and luxury food products. Beyond obvious advantages in distribution, this move also would give the family group new financial muscle to help protect it from big publicly-traded competitors like <ORGANIZATION> Seagram </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plc </ORGANIZATION>, which have been competing to acquire the dwindling number of quality beverage products still available In this respect, the planned merger resembles previous alliances that created other French family-controlled groups like <ORGANIZATION> Moet-Hennessy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> LVMH </ORGANIZATION> Moet-Hennessy-Louis <ORGANIZATION> Vuitton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>. Under the plan, the holding company of the <ORGANIZATION> Heriard-Dubreuil </ORGANIZATION> family will transfer its 51 percent interest in <PERSON> Remy </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Cointreau </LOCATION> and Cie., a holding company which controls 100 of <ORGANIZATION> Contreau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>. Each company will retain management autonomy after the deal. Other details of the asset swap have not yet been completed, but the companies said the Heriard-Dubreuil family will emerge with a slight majority over the <PERSON> Cointreau </PERSON> family in the newly formed group. The deal requires shareholder approval which is expected in the coming months, they said. The decision to unite the two companies follows years of close cooperation in distribution throughout the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cointreau </PERSON> family interests have also been long-term shareholders in <PERSON> Remy </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. Recent earnings data for <PERSON> Remy </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cointreau </PERSON> were not available since neither of the companies is publicly traded.

<HEAD>Grains, Soybeans Higher Despite Crop Estimates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures prices closed higher Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, shrugging off increased estimates of the nation's corn and soybean crop production. Corn prices were higher from the open as commercial buyers entered the market on reports the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> may make a purchase totalling 1.5 million metric tons. `` You can forget the production numbers,'' said analyst <ORGANIZATION> Mickey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sherson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` The figures have no meaning at all. What matters is the news flow, producer sales and export sales.'' The crop report released Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> estimated the 1989 corn harvest at 7.59 billion bushels, up 2 percent from the previous estimate, and soybean production at 1.94 billion bushels, 1 percent above the October estimate. Some analysts had predicted the crop report would trigger a selloff, with export demand offering some support to prices. Soybean prices were higher on carryover strength from the corn market and strong demand for soyoil. Prices also received support from concern over delays in the planting of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s soybean crop. Wheat prices were higher due to dryness in the winter wheat crop areas. At the close, wheat was 1 -RCB- cents to 5 -LCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.05 a bushel; corn was \ cent to 1 -LCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.38 cents a bushel; oats were -RCB- cent to 1 \ cents higher with December at $ 1.43 \ a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents to 8 -LCB- cents higher with November at $ 5.76 a

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION>, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products giant, said Friday its after-tax profit rose 15 percent in the third quarter from a year ago, partly due to a strong contribution from newly acquired businesses. <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> said its profit for the three months ended Sept. 30 came to 249 million pounds, or $ 396 million, compared with 216 million pounds, or $ 343 million, a year earlier. Earnings per share jumped to 14.14 pence, or 22 cents, from 11.57 pence, or 18 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 16 percent to 5.06 billion pounds, or $ 8.05 billion, compared with 4.36 billion pounds, or $ 6.9 billion, a year earlier. In the first nine months of the year, after-tax profit rose 16 percent to 701 million pounds, or $ 1.1 billion, from 603 million pounds, or $ 959 million. Per-share earnings came to 39.40 pence, or 63 cents, compared with 32.30 pence, or 51 cents. Sales rose 13 percent to 14.2 billion pounds, or $ 23 billion, from 12.6 billion pounds, or $ 20 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> said its European frozen products division did particularly strongly, especially in ice-cream sales. It also reported strong progress in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, profit was enhanced by acquisitions and a strong showing by the group's personal products and detergents businesses. In the past year, <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> has made various acquisitions in cosmetics, toiletries and fragrances. In August, for example, the company completed the purchase of several <ORGANIZATION> Faberge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> units for $ 1.55 billion.

 <ORGANIZATION> Banc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> One </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has announced a two-month delay in closing its deal to acquire <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>'s failed banks from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> because it's taking longer than anticipated to review <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>'s loan portfolios. Banc One said Thursday that there have been `` no unusual circumstances'' in the process, and the banking company hopes to complete the acquisition by Jan. 17. The Columbus, Ohio-based banking company acquired Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>'s 20 failed banks after federal banking regulators took them over, saying they were insolvent. <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> still owns five banks. The banks were merged into the <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which Banc One agreed to acquire for $ 500 million. Banc One chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> said in a prepared statement Thursday that `` progress is being made in restructuring the bridge bank under a management contract with the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>.''' He said the company has installed its own management and information systems in the bank and that the bank will be profitable in the first month after the deal closes.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises on East German Developments</HEAD>
<HEAD>Precede LONDON BC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar finished higher Friday as startling reforms in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and their uncertain affect on the economy of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> fueled demand for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. Gold prices eased. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid for gold at 4 p.m. EST of $ 386.25 a troy ounce, down from $ 386.30 late Thursday. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold lost 30 cents an ounce to close at $ 386.80. Traders said the dollar's biggest move came at the expense of the West German mark. The dollar opened at 1.8520 marks and rose steadily throughout the session, although it never broke through the 1.8700-mark level. `` People are getting anxious to get out of marks,'' said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrie </PERSON>, vice president at the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office. `` They're not sure what the impact might be,'' he said, referring to rapid-fire changes in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where travel restrictions put into place 28 years ago have been lifted permanently. The East bloc nation continued to shock the world Friday by announcing the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall would be opened in sections this weekend to create more border crossing points. But for currency investors, the addage is: `` When in doubt, buy dollars,'' <PERSON> Lawrie </PERSON> said. `` The historic events going on in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have created a ` safe-haven' situation for the dollar,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. But, he noted, expectations that fresh economic data due out next week would show continued weakening of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy limited the dollar's rise. `` There was reluctance to take the dollar much higher,'' he said. Next week the government is scheduled to report on the trade deficit, retail sales, business inventories and housing starts. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 142.75 yen, slightly higher than Thursday's close of 142.70 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar traded higher at 143.35 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar finished at 143.40 yen, up from from 143.13 yen on Thursday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound fell to $ 1.5765 from $ 1.5863 late Thursday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, one pound cost $ 1.5773, cheaper for buyers than Thursday's $ 1.5823. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late rates Thursday, included: 1.8670 West German marks, up from 1.8523; 1.6440 Swiss francs, up from 1.6250; 6.3255 French francs, up from 6.2810; 1,362.50 Italian lire, up from 1,354.25, and 1.1696 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1670. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late rates Thursday, included: 1.8625 West German marks, up from 1.8475; 1.6370 Swiss francs, up from 1.6212; 6.3135 French francs, up from 6.2545; 2.0950 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0815; 1,354.75 Italian lire, up from 1,351.50, and 1.1694 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1675. Gold prices moved lower. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> the metal slipped to a late bid of $ 386.00 a troy ounce, from $ 386.25 late Thursday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold fell to a closing bid of $ 384.50 an ounce from $ 387.30.

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Resorts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, burdened with massive debt, on Friday said it lost $ 34.9 million in the third quarter and acknowledged it may be forced into bankruptcy proceedings. The casino company, which owes investors $ 900 million, stopped paying interest to bondholders in August. Resorts and bondholder representatives have been negotiating a debt restructuring for several months. Regardless of the outcome of those talks, Resorts said it expects bondholders to file a petition to force the company into involuntary bankruptcy by Nov. 15 _ the first anniversary of entertainer <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s purchase of the company. Under federal bankruptcy laws, bondholders have a year to contend that company insiders wrongfully paid money to immunize it, for their own benefit, from bankruptcy claims. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> initially put up $ 100 million to purchase Resorts from developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. He later withdrew $ 50 million but gave Resorts a $ 10 million credit line. `` We believe that there is ... probably a likelihood that a petition would be filed by the 15th,'' said <PERSON> Alison </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, a Resorts spokeswoman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Analysts said the bondholders' action was not unexpected. `` Certainly, the bondholders are trying to protect themselves by having as much cash in the pot as possible,'' said <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roffman </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. In August, <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> told bondholders of Resorts and its subsidiaries _ <ORGANIZATION> Resorts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Griffin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resorts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ that interest payments would be halted. Separately, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, Resorts lost $ 34.9 million _ interest alone accounted for $ 32.5 million _ on revenues of $ 124.3 million. In the year-ago quarter, the company posted a loss of $ 339.8 million on revenues of $ 123.9 million. Per-share figures were not available. The company blamed lower casino revenue for the quarterly loss but noted that capital improvment projects should help improve some operations next year. First the first nine months, Resorts said it lost $ 81.5 million on revenues of $ 347.9 million, compared with $ 357.4 million lost on revenue of $ 353.6 million for the same period in 1988.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today proposed a $ 4.2 billion spending package to help the poor buy houses and the homeless receive shelter, and vowed to `` change the destructive practices'' that have blocked affordable housing in inner cities. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced the program, which he called `` a comprehensive agenda to help bring basic shelter and affordable housing within reach of millions of Americans,'' in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>. It includes $ 4.2 billion in direct grants and expenditures over three years and tax incentives costing an additional $ 2.7 billion. The president did not say how he would pay for the `` Home Ownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere'' program. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters the money could come from a cut in the capital gains tax. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are haggling over whether that tax should be cut. The package, entailing federal programs tied to state and local matching funds, includes $ 2.1 billion in grants to help residents of low-income housing buy their units. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed that state and local governments or non-profit groups pay $ 1 in matching funds for every $ 2 in federal HOPE grants. The grants would be used to rehabilitate and purchase units in public housing, vacant and foreclosed properties held by the government and `` distressed'' properties cited by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also offered incentives to local communities that remove bureaucratic barriers blocking the availability of affordable housing, such as zoning restrictions. He would give $ 210 million in insurance and rental rehabilitation grants for zones that best develop plans to remove such tax and regulatory barriers in inner city areas. `` We will change the destructive practices which have kept <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> out of the inner cities and distressed communities that most need its support,'' he said. He assigned <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> to name a panel that would recommend ways to remove barriers to affordable housing. `` No city, state or town should receive a single penny of HOPE funding until they have identified the barriers to affordable housing in their own back yard and start taking steps to remove them,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He said the centerpiece of his HOPE plan was `` to recapture the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream of home owneship for those who have been left behind.'' He also proposed: _ $ 728 million in federal housing funds, to be matched at the state and local level, for new housing and support services for the homeless. _ $ 1.08 billion to help tenant groups buy and convert federally subsidized buildings to resident-owned cooperatives. _ Allowing first-time buyers to use Individual Retirement Accounts for a home down payment without paying a penalty. _ $ 44 million for a demonstration project that would offer housing and support services for elderly people who otherwise would have to be institutionalized. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials said the state and local matching funds would add $ 1.7 billion in assistance. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also was attending a dinner to help <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> retire $ 2 million in debt from his 1986 campaign and helping dedicate a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> memorial to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans before flying home Saturday. In a speech last March 14, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` When you look out the window of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and see the ragged, pathetic figures huddled over the steam grates of the Ellipse, I see an affront to the American dream, a national shame.'' He ordered <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> then to come up with new ideas to get the homeless off the streets of urban <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Earlier in the year, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed spending $ 644 million in fiscal 1990 to carry out the McKinney Act, a program created to find housing for the homeless. President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was often criticized by homeless activists for not seeking more funds for the homeless. Federal funds for low-income housing were cut 75 percent during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> officials believe there are 8,000 to 10,000 people living on the streets of the nation's capital. Nationally, some researchers estimate 300,000 to 600,000 Americans are homeless on any given night. Some activists say the homeless number 2 million or more. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> has been enveloped in an influence-peddling scandal left over from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years and <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> has devoted most of his energy to date to straightening out his department's procedures for dispensing grants and contracts.

<TEXT>
 A federal bankruptcy judge on Friday granted <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> an extension of the deadline for filing its disclosure statement, which is intended to provide details of how it intends to emerge from Chapter 11 reorganization. In a hearing, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> gave <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> until Dec. 29, a 45-day extension, to submit the disclosure statement and a revised reorganization plan. The Miami-based airline had requested that the Nov. 13 deadline for the disclosure statement be extended for 60 days to Jan. 12. Eastern also had asked the court to extend to Jan. 12 its exclusive right to submit a proposed reorganization plan. During the exclusivity period, other parties to the case can not make reorganization proposals for Eastern, which recently submitted a revised plan to its major creditors. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s attorneys that if the airline files its disclosure statement by the new Dec. 29 deadline, it would automatically receive a 60-day extension of the exclusivity period. Eastern's striking unions opposed the extensions, while committees representing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> creditors and preferred shareholders supported them. Eastern said the requests were motivated by the size and complexity of its bankruptcy proceeding. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> previously had granted Eastern two extensions of its exclusivity period and one deferred deadline for filing the disclosure statement. The airline, which was struck by its pilots, Machinists and flight attendants on March 4 in an ongoing walkout, has hired replacement workers and is rebuilding as a smaller carrier. On Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> posted a third-quarter net loss of $ 185.2 million after reportedly advising creditors' attorneys of a $ 200 million cash shortfall looming in its rebuilding plan. Also this week, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> gave final congressional approval to legislation creating a congressional panel to investigate the eight-month-old strike against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, a measure the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has threatened to veto.

<HEAD>Group Buys 5 Percent Stake in Avon, Rekindling Takeover Speculation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An investment group including <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cosmetics </ORGANIZATION> has amassed a 5 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, it was disclosed Friday in an announcement that sparked speculation about a renewed takeover advance on <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION>. Avon earlier this year rebuffed overtures from <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Vice Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON> and rejected outright takeover proposals from investor <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> and rival direct seller <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s management repeatedly has insisted that the company is better off remaining independent, free to carry out plans aimed at improving the balance A limited partnership calling itself <ORGANIZATION> Chartwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> notified <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> that as of Friday morning it held 5 percent of <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s outstanding voting stock, <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> said in a news release <ORGANIZATION> Chartwell </ORGANIZATION>, in a letter, did not divulge its intentions, <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> said. Avon spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said there had n't been any direct contact between <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> executives and members of the investment group. He said <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> had no further comment to supplement its brief announcement. Trading of <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> stock was temporarily halted Friday for the announcement. The stock shot up when trading resumed, with the news spurring speculative purchases as investors bet that a takeover battle could be looming. Avon closed up $ 5.50 at $ 36.75 a share in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. The general partners in <ORGANIZATION> Chartwell </ORGANIZATION> were identified as members of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> family, which own significant real estate holdings, and <ORGANIZATION> Argonaut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, headed by <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>. The Getty Family Trust was listed as the sole limited partner. Attempts to contact the partners for comment were n't immediately successful. In the spring, <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON> revealed that he and some investor allies had been interested in <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> for some time. He said in a letter dated May 25 that if <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> succeeded in acquiring <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION>, the company would be run by <ORGANIZATION> Argonaut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, which he described as an investment arm of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosmetics </PERSON>, the Dallas-based door-to-door beauty products marketer that is the main unit of privately held <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The possibility of renewed takeover interest in <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> has been rumored on Wall Street for weeks. News last month from the company that direct sales in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> probably would be disappointing in the important fourth quarter shopping season _ due largely to sagging gift and jewelry sales _ intensified the speculation. There has been talk that disaffected shareholders might put pressure on <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s management to take a hard look at any new takeover offers that come along. The management evoked considerable stockholder consternation when it turned down two previous offers this year. A $ 41-a-share, or $ 2.85 billion, takeover bid from Minneapolis-based investor <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> was spurned as was an earlier one from <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> for $ 39 a share, or $ 2.1 billion. In the wake of the rejections, <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> implemented new cost controls and speeded up the sales of certain subsidiaries, mainly in health care services. More recently, <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> has said it is looking into the possibility of divesting its retail fragrance division, comprising <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> and <PERSON> Parfums </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>. The cosmetics company's latest financial results show a continuing turnaround in profitability that analysts say could suffer a slight setback by the prospective slump in fourth-quarter <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales. <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> earned $ 34.6 million, or 46 cents a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30 compared to a loss of $ 405.9 million, or $ 7.78 a share, in the third 1988 quarter, when the company took a $ 425 million after-tax charge for discontinued operations.

 The head of the 800,000-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> offered the organization's support Friday to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s $ 4.2 billion plan to help the poor and homeless. `` We're very much in favor of all the things he said,'' outgoing president <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gribin </PERSON> said after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> unveiled the plan in a speech to the association. `` This was the kind of thing we were looking for,'' <PERSON> Gribin </PERSON> said. `` It sounds like he has bought into ... a lot of the things'' suggested by <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, secretary of Housing and Urban Development. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, who accompanied <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, was given a standing ovation by the Realtors when introduced to the 4,800 people at the meeting. Earlier Friday, <PERSON> Gribin </PERSON> had called on the <ORGANIZATION> Bush </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to provide leadership to re-establish affordable housing as a national goal. `` This country is fundamentally moving away from an affordability situation and the reaffirmation of a national housing policy,'' <PERSON> Gribin </PERSON>, a real estate agent from <LOCATION> Encino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, told reporters. `` We need to get back on that because otherwise your kids and my kids and our grandchildren are not going to be able to own houses.'' Parts of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s program mirrors suggestions made by the Realtors, including allowing money to be withdrawn without penalty from <ORGANIZATION> Individual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retirement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounts </ORGANIZATION> to make down payments on homes. Earlier <PERSON> Gribin </PERSON> had suggested grandparents, in-laws and parents be allowed to dip into <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> savings to help the next generation of first-time home buyers. <PERSON> Gribin </PERSON> said the Realtors would continue to work on legislation to broaden the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> availability. Also, <PERSON> Gribin </PERSON> called for replacing current limits on <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> loans with a sliding scale tying them to house prices in specific regions. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> recently passed legislation raising <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> loan limits to $ 124,878. <PERSON> Gribin </PERSON> said the limit still is too low in 10 of the nation's largest 13 metropolitan areas, locking out first-time and low-income home buyers. A study by the Realtors showed that more than half of <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> - and Veterans Administration-backed loans are for entry-level buyers <PERSON> Gribin </PERSON> said the limit should be set at 95 percent of the current median price in a given market.

<TEXT>
 Events raced ahead of would-be industrial policymakers this past week as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> semiconductor companies made deals with <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> and the Japanese. While <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was holding hearings on the health of the vital <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chip industry, the chip makers themselves were out fending for themselves as best they could, with mixed results. The week's developments again raised the question of whether government agencies and blue-chip industry panels were either quick enough or patient enough to make a real contribution to the global battle for industrial supremacy. Conservative skeptics say government-led industrial policy is fated to failure, while supporters say it could work if Americans only learned to do it right. So far, though, both sides agree that the awkward early efforts are being outpaced by the real world of business. Three things happened this past Wednesday that illustrated different dimensions of the issue: _ <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> chip makers said they had reached an agreement with Japanese electronics companies that eventually could allow the Americans to make customized chips for the next generation of Japanese televisions. _ <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said it would license the technology for making its most powerful computer memory chip to <ORGANIZATION> Micron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> _ And in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the head of the government-supported chip consortium <ORGANIZATION> Sematech </ORGANIZATION> told a congressional committee that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort to regain supremacy in chips is in jeopardy The statement from <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Noyce </PERSON> came as talk circulated that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration wants to cut back on some research projects, including <ORGANIZATION> Sematech </ORGANIZATION>. In part, the deal between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chipmakers and Japanese companies was a rare victory for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government efforts to get a bigger share of the Japanese chip market. But it also illustrated that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continues to negotiate from a position of weakness. American companies will get from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> the information they need to design chips for the Japanese. But there is no guarantee that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> actually will buy American-made chips. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chip makers would like to make circuits for American-made high-definition televisions as well, although the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's decision not to make a full-fledged commitment to HDTV could bog down development of that technology. `` Businesses are going to move forward whether the government does or not,'' said <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Alford </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> made its deal with <ORGANIZATION> Micron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> to ensure that there would be another source of U.S.-made memory chips. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said it also intended to supply its technology to a chip-making consortium called <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of which it is a strong backer. Unfortunately for industrial policy mavens, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Memories has been slow to get off the ground since its inception in June. Critics say a joint manufacturing venture wo n't work. And they say that <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> through its deal with <ORGANIZATION> Micron </ORGANIZATION> has essentially made <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Memories unnecessary, something <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> disputes. Most disheartening to the supporters of industrial policy were impressions, perhaps unfounded, that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's commitment to <ORGANIZATION> Sematech </ORGANIZATION> and the U.S.-Japanese chip trade agreement was waning at a critical time Rep. <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, D-Calif., said his office had gotten leaks saying `` high administration officials are conducting a slash-and-burn campaign seeking to systematically eliminate most of the major initiatives designed to return this country to the industrial cutting edge. `` What I find marvelous about our government is that they criticize business for being short-sighted, then they show incredible volatility in programs that take five years or more to play out,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Finan </PERSON>, a managing director of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consulting firm of Quick, <ORGANIZATION> Finan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>. In other business and economic news this past week: _ <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>, who guided the company to record profitability during the late 1980s, announced he will retire March Vice Chairman <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Poling </PERSON> is slated to take the helm of the nation's second-largest automaker. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> eased credit to counter a slowdown in the economy, which was marked by layoffs at several major companies But the signs of weakness were countered by a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report that wholesale prices rose 0.4 percent in October. _ <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> opened the <ORGANIZATION> Berlin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> and gave its citizens permission to freely cross the rest of its borders in a move that experts said would have immediate benefits for American companies in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> _ although the short-term prospects for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> multinationals in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> were uncertain

<TEXT>
 The latest easing of credit by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has been greeted with something short of all-out elation on Wall Street. Just about every Fed-watcher in the financial world agreed that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> sent out signals this past week that it was relaxing its credit policy further, continuing a series of moves in that direction over the past several months. But analysts' readings of the motivations for that step were not so unanimous. The first, and most popular, interpretation was that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> was satisfied with the progress of recent efforts to keep inflation in check, and saw a chance to cushion the potential impact of a slowing economy. That view offered reassurance to investors who have been worried that the recent dropoff in corporate earnings might be a portent of more bad news to come on profits and a possible recession in early 1990. Some observers, however, suggested that it was n't inflation that was uppermost in <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policymakers' minds, but rather concern in some form about a possible deflationary situation. Since late summer many a wary eye has been focused on the market for junk bonds, high-yielding securities used to finance buyouts and other deals, amid signs that the lending boom of the late 1980s might be ending. At the same time, a massive campaign continues to unscramble the problems of the nation's network of savings institutions. And less specific worries lately have been voiced about the potential effects of weak real estate markets in places such as the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, where the market for properties had been rising for a long time. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> does not need a new credit crisis,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> in the issue published Friday of his newsletter <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'s Interest Rate Observer <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> posited the theory that `` inflation is guiding monetary policy in most of the world's financial centers, but deflation is calling the tune in ours.'' Such talk, combined with worries about profit disappointments at many companies, kept the stock market on the defensive in the past week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 3.90 to 2,625.61. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index rose 0.62 to 187.90; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market gained 2.82 to 455.79, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index was down 0.32 at 371.47. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 148.76 million shares a day, against 148.18 million the week before. The potential hazards of `` leverage'' _ large amounts of debt in many forms _ in the American economy have been debated on Wall Street for years. But lately there have been several signs that concern about the situation has been increasing. For one thing, the calm news on inflation of late would not explain why the prices of gold and gold-mining stocks have rallied in recent days. But heightened worries about deflation could well account for the upswing in precious metals. Published commentaries by several brokerage firms have recently broached the term `` financial distress.'' `` Some of the words that define financial distress seem appropriate today,'' observed <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` They would include uneasiness, apprehension, tension, stringency, pressure, uncertainty and fragility.'' Some of the main concerns <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> cites touch on a familiar theme: `` As the economy slows, highly leveraged companies will have difficulty making debt service payments, and ` investors' will have difficulty in arranging for financing to acquire companies. `` From time to time,'' he says, there are likely to be `` shocks to the financial system. `` Fortunately,'' he adds, `` we feel that they, for the most part, are manageable _ if many shocks do not occur simultaneously. Financial distress and rising stock prices are not mutually exclusive.''

<HEAD>Grain and Soybeans Prices Jump Despite Bearish Crop Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures surged higher Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as buyers shrugged off increased estimates of the nation's corn and soybean crop production. On other markets, precious metals and copper declined, sugar rose, energy futures were lower, and livestock and pork futures were mixed. Wheat settled 1 \ cents to 5 -RCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.04 -LCB- a bushel; corn was a \ cent to 1 -LCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.38 a bushel; oats were -RCB- cent to 1 \ cents higher with December at $ 1.43 \ a bushel; soybeans were 4 -RCB- cents to 8 -LCB- cents higher with November at $ 5.75 -RCB- Corn prices were higher from the opening of trading as commercial buyers entered the market on reports the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> may buy 1.5 million metric tons. `` You can forget the production numbers,'' said analyst <ORGANIZATION> Mickey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sherson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` The figures have no meaning at all. What matters is the news flow, producer sales and export sales.'' The crop report released Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> estimated the 1989 corn harvest at 7.59 billion bushels, up 2 percent from the previous estimate, and soybean production at 1.94 billion bushels, 1 percent above the October estimate. Some analysts had predicted the crop report would trigger a Friday selloff, with export demand offering some support to prices. Soybean prices were higher on carryover strength from the corn market and strong demand for soyoil. Prices also received support from concern over delays in the planting of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s soybean crop. Wheat prices were higher due to dryness in the winter wheat crop areas. Precious metals prices dropped on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Gold was 40 cents to 50 cents lower with December at $ 388.60 a troy ounce; silver was 4.4 cents to 4.9 cents lower with December at $ 5.26 a troy ounce. Copper settled lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Comex </ORGANIZATION> amid uncertainty over the amount of stocks in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Metal Exchange-approved warehouses. There were forecasts earlier in the week of lower stocks, which were replaced Friday by expectations of increased stocks. Copper was .60 cent to 1.25 cents lower with the contract in December at $ 1.145 a pound. Supply concerns and worry that <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> may have trouble meeting its export obligations again boosted sugar prices on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, Sugar and <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Sugar was .17 cent to .24 cent higher with January at 14.50 cents a pound. Energy futures were lower in quiet trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Heating oil led crude oil and gasoline prices lower in a drop attributed to seasonal pressures. `` Consumers usually put heating oil in the tank in October, just as the weather is getting cold,'' said analyst <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` They usually do n't fill up again until December. Making this usually a disappointing month for heating oil.'' West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 8 cents to 15 cents lower with December at 19.84 cents a barrel; heating oil was .27 cent to .47 cent lower with December at 58.45 a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .22 cent to .40 cent lower with December at 51.82 cents a gallon. Livestock and pork futures were mixed in light trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Cattle, although slightly higher, are in a holding pattern because of a quiet cash market, said analyst <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Sterling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. Hogs and pork belly prices were mixed, getting support from lighter slaughter activity but coming under pressure from lower cash prices, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said Live cattle were .07 cent to .17 cent higher with December at 74.92 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent lower to .17 cent higher with November at 83.15 a pound; hogs were .30 cent lower to 43 cent higher with December at 47.95 a pound; frozen pork bellies were .40 cent lower to .13 cent higher with February at 63.30 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
 Bond prices finished little changed Friday in light activity as many traders stayed out of the market for Veterans Day. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s closely watched 30-year bond ended unchanged from late Thursday, with its yield at 7.89 percent. Analysts said bond prices were little changed after the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> entered the market for a second day to drain reserves from the banking system. The intervention, which began on Thursday, suggested that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> does not want the key federal funds rate to fall below 8 -LCB- percent, said <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiners </PERSON>, vice president for money-market research at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s move was a surprise. It will cause short-term yields to rise because no one was forecasting'' the move, Ms. <PERSON> Reiners </PERSON> said. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted late in the day at 8 -RRB- percent, unchanged from late Thursday. Analysts said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s draining action signaled a retreat from a maneuver earlier in the week that had suggested the central bank was relaxing its credit policy and encouraging lower interest rates. On Monday and Tuesday, the central bank injected billions of dollars of reserves into the market, pushing short-term interest rates lower. Trading was light Friday, with many traders taking a long weekend in observance of Veterans Day on Saturday. Bond prices also were unaffected by Friday's <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> auction of $ 10 billion in short-term debt, in the form of 36-day cash management bills. The bills carried a discount interest rate of 8.14 percent and an equivalent coupon interest rate of 8.32 percent. `` You ca n't read too much into that,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Mitchell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Held </ORGANIZATION>, chief financial economist at <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities, prices of short-term government issues edged down 1-32 point, intermediate maturities were unchanged to 1-32 point lower and longer-term issues were 1-32 point lower to 1-32 point higher, according to figures provided by <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, slipped 0.22 to 1,193.35. In corporate trading, industrials rose. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, edged up 0.11 to 338.63. In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds was at 9219-32, up 1-32. The average yield to maturity was 7.34 percent, unchanged from late Thursday. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills rose to 7.96 percent as the discount gained 2 basis points to 7.71 percent. Yields on six-month bills were unchanged at 7.97 percent as the discount remained stable at 7.57 percent. Yields on one-year bills were flat at 7.81 percent as the discount remained unchanged at 7.30 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity.

 Three senior executives of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of oil company <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, announced Friday they are resigning at year's end. Officials of Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> said the resignations had been expected after the company purchased <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> last April. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, senior vice president, said they plan to pursue other interests after Dec. 31, but will continue to assist with post-merger related activities. Executive Vice President <PERSON> Derrill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cody </PERSON> will join the <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> law firm of <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stringer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>. `` The resignations are of a routine nature as a result of the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> into the Panhandle Eastern system,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>. Many other <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> employees have been offered early retirement or severance packages to be taken by Dec. 31, he said. Sixty-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> acquired <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> in April to begin operating one of the largest interstate natural gas pipeline systems in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The company's operating units provide natural gas to the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions. Price said that since the merger, <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has been working to sell <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s assets other than pipelines. `` Those assets have included, so far, the exploration and production activities of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, their refinery activities, their interests in liquid petroleum gas, their real estate interests like <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, and other investment activities,'' Price said. <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> will act as consultants in those negotiations, he said. `` <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s success in absorbing <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> is based in large part on the efforts of <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON> and his associates. They have agreed to continue helping <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION> where they can, and we will continue to rely on them,'' said R.D. <PERSON> Hunsucker </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>. `` Hendrix, <PERSON> Cody </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and others have been key participants in the asset sales which have contributed to the significant reduction in <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition-related debt,'' he said. `` Under arrangements made in conjunction with their departures, several of these executives will retain major responsibilities for the continued success of <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION>'s divestiture strategy.

 The opening of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall and lifting of travel restrictions on East German citizens could have immediate benefits for American companies in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, although short-term prospects for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> multinationals to expand into <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> are unclear, experts said Friday. Any move to the East by <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and other multinationals wo n't happen overnight without a change in the current political structure of the communist nation, but sweeping changes could occur in the next decade `` Within the next five years, we will start to see noticeable and significant flows of money and goods from west to east,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON>, economist with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the retailer that has done business in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> for 65 years, said the flow of thousands of East Berliners across the border this week already had boosted sales of its West German operations `` They're already shopping at our stores. They've been very crowded in the last 24 hours,'' said <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Garofalo </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president of investor relations in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` They're not wealthy people, but many may have savings because there was nothing to buy in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> has 225 general merchandise stores in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, including 24 in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> stock rose $ 3.25 to $ 60.87 -LCB- a share Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on what one analyst attributed to positive sentiment about the political events in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Elsewhere on Wall Street, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> Fund recorded one of the day's biggest percentage gains The fund finished up $ 2.75 at $ 13.50 a share as the West German stock market, where the fund invests, responded to the opening of the East German borders. Officials of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which has been in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since 1925, said they were watching closely as events unfolded. Vice Chairman <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Poling </PERSON>, who will become chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> on March 1, said the world's second largest automobile maker was looking at `` all the opportunities.'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> has manufacturing and assembly operations throughout <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> that employ about 37,500 people. Analysts said the opening of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and recent events in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> point to tremendous opportunities for Americans and other industrialists around the world. But any increased business in the Eastern Bloc nations will depend on the timing of political reforms, strategists said. `` They will need a new political structure before anyone will know what to do,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Veit </PERSON>, international economist with <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harriman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` It will be negative for the defense industry but positive, a larger positive, for all other companies,'' <PERSON> Veit </PERSON> said. West German companies will have the competitive edge in the <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION> once the reforms get under way, economists said. Multinational companies already doing business in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will be positioned to enter the East German market behind the West Germans but American companies will get a fair share of the market if they move aggressively, <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON> said. `` The rush to invest in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> ... will depend on how quickly Western money and Western capitalists are willing to move in ...,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Garofalo </PERSON> said that as recently as six weeks ago <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> officials were in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to explore future opportunities. `` There was some writing on the wall even a few weeks ago,'' he said.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge has denied a motion sought by the <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to prohibit a research company from paying its dividends. The companies are in a joint venture that has gone sour. In a ruling issued earlier this week, Vice Chancellor <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> denied a preliminary injunction sought by <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> against <ORGANIZATION> Hem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Neither company returned telephone calls late Friday afternoon. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> and Hem, which has headquarters in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, formed a joint venture in 1987 for the development, marketing and distribution of a drug called ampligen, which they said would be used in treating acquired immune deficiency syndrome and cancer. But in April, <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> filed suit in <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, seeking $ 30 million and an end to the joint venture. The suit alleged Hem misrepresented the effectiveness of ampligen and sought the preliminary injunction to block payment of dividends. Chancellor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> denied the request to end the joint venture, saying <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> had no jurisdiction over that issue. The court, however, indicated it could rule on the issue of the dividends. <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> had claimed in its motion that Hem would become insolvent if it paid its dividends and other business charges. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>'s argument was `` factually unsupported and legally unsound.'' `` Hem is not presently insolvent, and the proposed dividend and other payments will not render it insolvent,'' <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said. As of Dec. 31, 1988, Hem had a net worth of $ 8.5 million. The proposed dividends and other payments were about $ 1.154 million.

<HEAD>Economist: McDonald's Promotion Pushing Pork Prices Slightly Higher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN P. ROSENFELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s nationwide promotion of McRib barbecued pork sandwiches has helped prop up prices in the nation's hog markets, an economist says. Economist <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimes </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> says that if the 8,000-restaurant fast-food chain makes the sandwich a permanent part of the menu it would open a significant new market for pork. But he adds that would translate into long-term support for higher prices only if producers break with traditional practice and refuse to increase hog production in response to the increased demand. If past experience is any guide, he says, hog farmers will raise more pigs in anticipation of increased sales to <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. `` Five years from now, we'd have basically the same hog price if they -LRB- McDonald's -RRB- did it or not,'' he said in a telephone interview. McRib made its debut in several test markets earlier in the 1980s and was revived last month for a nationwide test. McDonald's is not disclosing its plans for McRib once a month-long national advertising campaign for the sandwiches ends Nov. 20. But public relations consultant <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Klettke </PERSON> said Friday that `` the sales are going well. The feeling is very optimistic.'' He said preliminary figures on the performance of the sandwich are as yet unreliable, and that even if meaningful results were available, the company would not want them made public because of competition. When the promotion was launched last month, McDonald's said it planned to serve 80 million of the four-ounce boneless shoulder cuts, which are prepared in a hickory-flavored sauce with pickles and onions on a home-style roll. <PERSON> Klettke </PERSON> said <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>'s not only would analyze the performance of McRib but the impact of its sales on the sales of its other sandwiches and whether there are regional trends in sales. He also said analysts would consider whether the product might have seasonal or year-round appeal. The promotion, which began Oct. 20, will run for four to six weeks, depending on the market, even though the national advertising ends after one month, <PERSON> Klettke </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Grimes </PERSON>, who specializes in the pork industry, estimates the promotion is using 1.5 percent to 2.3 percent of the current supply of hogs nationwide. Each 1 percent change in supplies influences prices of live hogs by 1.85 percent to 2 percent, <PERSON> Grimes </PERSON> said. He estimated the added demand for a limited supply of hogs is bidding up the price of live hogs by about 1.25 cents to 1.85 cents a pound. The restaurant chain already serves bacon, sausage and Canadian bacon as part of its breakfast menu. It also is experimenting with pizza, which could have sausage, pepperoni or other pork toppings.

 Oil futures prices closed lower in thin volume Friday as a late round of selling wiped out slight gains earlier in the day. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> the December contract for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark grade of crude oil, fell 8 cents to finish at $ 19.84 a 42-gallon barrel. The contract for January delivery closed down 11 cents at $ 19.67 a barrel. Both contracts had modest gains in the previous session, largely on technical factors. Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale unleaded gasoline for December lost 0.40 cent to 51.82 cents a gallon and January fell 0.26 cent to 52.54 cents a gallon. No. 2 heating oil for December ended 0.47 cent lower at 58.45 cents a gallon, while the contract for January delivery slipped 0.33 cent to 58.62 cents. Crude prices have moved in a fairly narrow range in recent days as market players turn their attention increasingly to reports of overproduction by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Analysts say that while investors are concerned about reports of higher production and lower demand, they are reluctant to push prices much lower in advance of the Nov. 25 meeting of the cartel in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> is expected to discuss production strategy for 1990 as well as reallocation of output quotas at the meeting.

 <ORGANIZATION> Bicoastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, formerly <ORGANIZATION> Singer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> headed by onetime corporate raider <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON>, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Friday following a tumultuous two years of legal battles and divestments. A company annoucement said Bicoastal expects to file a reorganization plan soon seeking to `` provide for the payment of valid creditors and provide a method to resolve disputed claims.'' Bicoastal said the filing does not affect its remaining subsidiaries, which include makers of aircraft and nuclear plant training simulators and weapons control systems. Officials at Tampa-based Bicoastal could not be reached late Friday. Singer, renamed earlier this year, was acquired by <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> in January 1988 in a $ 1.06 billion takeover. <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> sold off eight of the company's 12 divisions, including some of the most profitable, and sparked a flood of employee lawsuits and other litigation, estimated to exceed $ 500 million. In June, <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> was convicted on nine counts of securities fraud, conspiracy to commit tax fraud and making false statements to the government. Three months later, he was sentenced to a four-year prison term and fined $ 1.5 million. It is uncertain how the bankruptcy filing will affect the reported $ 75 million purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Mesa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partnership </ORGANIZATION>'s interest in Bicoastal The Wall Street Journal on Friday reported that New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Leucadia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> agreed in principle to buy the stock and notes <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> acquired in connection with <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON>'s takeover. <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, an <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION>, Texas-based partnership headed by raider <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>, loaned <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON>'s group $ 150 million and negotiated an option to take control of the Singer board if the company failed by pay the entire loan plus interest by April 1, 1989. The date was later extended to July 1. The pact could give <ORGANIZATION> Leucadia </ORGANIZATION> control of the board of Bicoastal, a 138-year-old company that grew from a sewing machine manufacturer to a major defense contractor. There was no answer at <ORGANIZATION> Leucadia </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office late Friday. In May, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> placed an injunction against transfer of any major Singer assets without court approval. <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>'s action came after the government filed a $ 231 million defense-contract overcharge suit.

 The union representing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' pilots said Friday it has urged its members to support its continued efforts to gain control of parent company, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The pilots' union also disclosed that since a pilot-management bid for the airline failed last month, it has `` had conservations'' with <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> billionaire <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who previously bid for <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> and `` other financial investors.'' The union also said spoken with the machinists' union and would have further discussions. The letter did not elaborate on any of the discussions and a spokesman for the pilots' union did not return calls Friday. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> declined to comment on the latest development, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornacker </PERSON>. In trading Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> rose $ 4.25 a share to $ 189.50. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> leadership released a letter, sent Thursday, urging members to strictly enforce their existing labor contract beginning Nov. 22, when a self-imposed deadline on voluntary labor concessions expires. The pilots are seeking a new contract to replace the one that expired in April 1988. However, the pilots leadership stated in the letter that continued takeover moves toward <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> made it doubtful an agreement could be reached soon. `` Given that the company is obviously ` in play' we see no way that management will get serious about an equitable new contract ... unless it knows who is going to own the company,'' the letter said. `` In our view, the piece of trash that the company recently passed across the table clearly proves that fact. `` Unless the entire world clearly understands what we contribute or do n't contribute to the operation of the airline we will have little chance of getting either an equitable new contract or an appropriate new -LRB- employee stock ownership proposal -RRB- to be put to the Board and accepted.'' It called on pilots to prepare to stop flying <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s new 747 model 400s and working four extra hours a month. The pilots had been doing both as a show of good faith during its participation in a pilot-management bid for the airline. Pilots and management signed a merger agreement with <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s board in September. As a show of good faith, pilots said they would fly <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s 747 model 400s they previously would not fly and work an 85-hour work-month, rather than the 81 hours stipulated in their contract. The pilots had refused to fly the model 400s because of a dispute over how many crew members should be used. When the deal fell apart in October when the group was unable to obtain financing for its $ 6.75 billion offer, the employee group again approached the board with a framework for a restructured transaction, but the board at that time terminated the negotiations, the union said. `` We intend to work intensively over the next two weeks ... to put together a new transaction so that the new owners of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> will in fact be the employees and not some unwanted outsider,'' the pilots' union said in the letter. Earlier this week, the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> board reportedly authorized chairman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> to explore new means of mounting a buyout or recapitalization of the company. On Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, which has accumulated a 9.7 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, met with machinists of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> to detail their intentions for the company. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> has said it intends to oust most of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s board. The machinists had declined to join an effort by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> pilots, flight attendants and management for employee ownership of the airline.
