 Faced with thickening ice, plunging temperatures and the imminent departure of two Soviet icebreakers, rescuers late Thursday made a last-ditch effort to free two whales threatened again by the arctic icepack. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gray whales, freed from nearly three weeks confinement in their icebound breathing hole off <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barrow </LOCATION>, moved closer to open water via man-made breathing holes and channels cut in the ice by the Soviet ships. But as night fell Thursday, the whales were in the last breathing hole cut for them, with about 300 meters of ice between the hole and open water, said rescue coordinator <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>. Temperatures Thursday hovered around 15 degrees below zero and were expected to drop to minus 20 to 25 degrees below overnight, cold enough to begin freezing over the adjoining open water of the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. Rescuers left a portable generator to power de-icing equipment at the whale's last breathing hole and light a beacon for the icebreaker <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Arseniev </PERSON>, which was to make two or three final runs to try to free the whales. `` This should free them,'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said. `` Hopefully, the whales will see the opportunity to leave. We've given them the best shot tonight.'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said the Soviets had to leave Thursday night. The plunging temperatures quickly refroze the channels the icebreaker had made earlier Thursday. Eskimos broke out chain saws and cut dozens more breathing holes leading away from the clogged channel toward the open sea. By nightfall, the workers were encountering dangerously unstable ice as a result of the icebreakers' earlier efforts. As they did Wednesday, the whales readily followed the path cut for them by the Eskimos. As night fell, they had advance as far as the last breathing hole. In a new tactic, rescuers carved 30 new holes Thursday in hopes that the whales would follow the holes away from the channel and eventually reach open water via another route the Soviet ships were clearing. `` They're ready to go home'' after nearly six months at sea, said Rear Adm. <PERSON> Sigmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` We felt also with the weather creeping in like this, we had to do something tonight.'' Everyone hopes that when daylight arrives Friday, both the Soviets and the whales will be gone, <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> ice analyst <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Huffard </PERSON> said the open water was definitely beginning to freeze, but he remained optimistic that the whales could escape if they could get beyond the edge of the pressure ridge battered down by the icebreakers earlier in the week. Eskimos with chain saws had cut a series of breathing holes that allowed the whales to swim well away from the original hole to which they had been confined. The whales grew accustomed to the cutting and during a frenzy of work Wednesday, in which 50 new holes were cut, the whales repeatedly surfaced in the new holes before the last block of ice was removed. Since the whales were accustomed to the noise of the saws, that sound might be used to coax them forward toward open water, said <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, a biologist with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The Eskimos eventually worked the marine mammals to within a quarter-mile of a channel carved through the 18-inch-thick ice by two Soviet icebreakers late Tuesday and early Wednesday. Then the icebreaker <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Arseniev </PERSON> reopened the partially frozen channel. The man-made channel, aimed at guiding the whales to an natural open `` lead'' through the ice and eventually to open water, partially refroze during the night, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said. He said the whales were `` conditioning themselves back to reality'' after nearly three weeks of confinement in the ice off the coast near <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barrow </LOCATION>. He also announced a crackdown on access to the whales by reporters and others. He said pilots entering restricted air space over the whales were subject to fines of $ 25,000. A biologist for the North Slope Borough, <PERSON> Geoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, said Thursday that the whales continued to appear healthy. The fate of the whales may never be known. Scientists involved in the rescue that cost more than $ 800,000 did n't attach radio transmitters to the whales to track them, in part because of concern that the devices would only add to their stress, said federal marine mammal biologist <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>. A whale that was trapped with the pair nearly three weeks ago apparently died last week. The endangered <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gray whales have one of the longest migration routes of all mammals, 6,000 to 8,000 miles from summer feeding grounds in the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> to the warm water off <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Their population has risen to about 20,000, growing at an annual average of 2.5 percent for the past decade, officials said.

 One millionaire said he is sure he will go to heaven when he dies but another thinks death really is the end. A third thinks of heaven as eternally watching cricket. The thoughts emerged in a new book today, `` My God,'' compiled by actress <PERSON> Hayley </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> and rock music manager <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> Maclaine </PERSON>. They asked famous people for their personal concept of God and what happens when they die. Succinct replies came from novelist <PERSON> Kingsley </PERSON> <PERSON> Amis </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> general director <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON>. They answered `` None'' and `` Nothing.'' Lord <PERSON> Forte </PERSON>, millionaire hotel owner and caterer, was more optimistic. `` I am certain that Heaven _ and I am confident I will not be sent elsewhere _ will be a beautiful place, but I have no fixed conception of what it will be like. I am prepared to be pleasantly surprised,'' he said. Musician <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON>, the former Beatle and also very rich, thought God was a shortenened version of good and that `` When you die you conk out.'' <PERSON> Yoko </PERSON> <PERSON> Ono </PERSON>, widow of murdered Beatle <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>, said: `` God is the unknown power which is within. Death is a transition.'' Author-scientist <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> does n't believe in God but added, `` I'm very interested in him.'' <PERSON> Astrologer </PERSON> <PERSON> Patric </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> replied: `` All I know for sure about God is that it is n't me.'' <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Archer </PERSON>, the best-selling novelist, said he had no idea what would happen to him after death, but hoped he would find himself on top of the pavilion at Lord's cricket ground in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> watching the game. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, president of the 850,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Amalgamated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, replied: `` I only pray that when I die there will be no pickets at the <PERSON> Pearly </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, only a sign saying ` Vacancies, apply within.'''

 What could easily be one of only operas ever performed in ancient langauge of the <ORGANIZATION> Aztecs </ORGANIZATION> will be staged at the Pyramids of <LOCATION> Teotihuacan </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Tenor <PERSON> Placido </PERSON> <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON>, singing in <LOCATION> Nauhatl </LOCATION>, will star in the premiere of <PERSON> Lalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Schifrin </PERSON>'s `` Songs of the Aztecs'' on the stone stage of the Square of the Moon, built centuries ago by ancient Meso-Americans. <PERSON> Schifrin </PERSON> will conduct the <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philharmonic </ORGANIZATION> at the Oct. 29 event, a benefit to launch a campaign for the restoration of the Aztec Temple of <LOCATION> Teotihuacan </LOCATION>, an hour's drive from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> has pledged $ 100,000 toward the restoration. The composer said doing an opera in <LOCATION> Nauhatl </LOCATION> was not a serious problem. `` The chorus and singers are used to the phonetics of a foreign language,'' he said. `` I thought it would be better to do it in the original language. With a translation, the use of a dictionary and grammar, I was able to work it out. <PERSON> Chocolatl </PERSON> was a secret drink of the <LOCATION> Aztecs </LOCATION>. We say chocolate. Our word coyote comes from their coyotetl.'' He was helped by a Nauhatl authority, Dr. <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Beaudo </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toulouse </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Schifrin </PERSON> wrote the music after finding some pre-Columbian poetry, in Spanish, by <PERSON> Nezahualcoyotl </PERSON> -LRB- 1432-72 -RRB-. `` -LRB- It -RRB- was so beautiful I decided to use it,'' he said. `` The last line of the poem is, ` It can not be in vain why we come to this <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>; let us leave some flowers; let us leave some songs.''' For the Oct. 29 performance, 10,000 chairs will be set up, a new sound system built and TV screens put in to provide subtitles in Spanish and English. `` We're trying to make some of the prices very popular,'' he said. `` A thousand people are going to pay very, very high prices. I can not tell you how much money it takes to preseve something that is very important. ... To know where we're coming from is going to help us to know where we're going.'' The pyramids at <LOCATION> Teotihuacan </LOCATION> date from 100 B.C. to 100 A.D. The site of the concert, <PERSON> Schifrin </PERSON> said, is in the City of the Gods in a square of stone, the Square of the Moon. `` The square is raised; it's exactly the place for the full symphony, full chorus, soloists and conductor, where musicians used to play 500 years ago,'' he said. `` It was a stage; they built it for us. Along a stone avenue are ruins of temples and stairways. The whole place looks very impressive. We go to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> to find architectural riches but we have it right here.'' That <PERSON> Schifrin </PERSON> is the composer of so esoteric a work may surprise those who know him either from his jazz days with <PERSON> Dizzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> or as a composer of more than 80 film and TV scores. <PERSON> Schifrin </PERSON>, who is 56, was born in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, where his father was concertmaster of the <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philharmonic </LOCATION>. He studied composition and piano at the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Conservatory, and returned to <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> where he became a composer, arranger, conductor and pianist, in pop, jazz and classical music. `` I've seen opera since I was a child. I had a dramatic instinct. This is probably one of the first times I'm saying this openly but I think movies are the opera of today,'' he said. `` In ` The <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> Kid,' where I had <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> playing along with a symphony orchestra, it was not pop music. This was really serious music _ to me, and I think to many people. `` The score of ` Bullitt' is being played by symphony orchestras now. I did an arrangement of symphonic sketches from the score of ` Cool Hand <PERSON> Luke </PERSON>.''' He moved to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1958 and played piano in <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>'s quintet from 1960-62. He composed `` Gillespiana Suite'' for the first record he on which he played with Dizzy. `` Many people think I went to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> to make money,'' she said. `` I did n't have any idea about how much money I was going to make. There is a group of composers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and there is no outlet to play their music. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON> was the only example since <PERSON> Haydn </PERSON> to have his own orchestra to play his own music. The reason I went to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> was, there was an outlet for hearing your music you composed.'' Lately, he has done less film composing and more conducting. Last December, he became music director of the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Philharmonic. Their first recording together, <PERSON> Ravel </PERSON>'s `` <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Goose </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Stravinsky </PERSON>'s `` Petrushka'' and <PERSON> Schifrin </PERSON>'s double bass concerto with soloist <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Karr </PERSON>, is being released this fall `` I think music is to be shared, and not only through mechanical means like records. You can be in a theater or even a stadium, doing something for several thousand people. That is very thrilling.''

 He's punched out the Penguin, wrestled the Riddler and crushed the Catwoman. But after 48 years of crime-busting, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> _ yes, the Boy Wonder, <PERSON> Batman </PERSON>'s earnest if excitable teen-age sidekick _ has been blown to bits by the Joker. Death comes next week for <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> when <ORGANIZATION> DC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comics </ORGANIZATION> distributes <PERSON> Batman </PERSON> issue No. 428, the third installment of the four-part `` A Death in the Family,'' in which the younger half of the Dynamic Duo is dynamited by the clown prince of crime. `` It was very odd. I realize all this stuff is made up, but everybody here felt like the family of an accident victim, waiting for the doctor to come out and say, ` There's still hope,''' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON>, editor of the Batman series. The Joker, by the way, is doing more than undermining the quality of life in <LOCATION> Gotham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> these days; his incendiary eradication of <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> comes under his duties as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s new ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. But it wo n't be the Joker, <PERSON> Batman </PERSON> creator <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, or <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON> facing murder charges for the killing of <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> _ it's the readers of the Batman comics who voted in a phone-in poll to off the teen superhero born in 1940. A 900 number was set up on Sept. 15-16 by <ORGANIZATION> DC </ORGANIZATION> to allow fans to phone in the fate of <PERSON> Robin </PERSON>, who _ in case you have forgotten _ is the ward of <LOCATION> Gotham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> millionaire <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>. It was the first time <ORGANIZATION> DC </ORGANIZATION> has allowed its readers to decide a character's future, said <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON>, who also killed off <PERSON> Batgirl </PERSON> in the late 1960s. The final totals: 5,343 for the death penalty, 5,271 against. Oooof! There is some good news. The dead <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> is NOT <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Grayson </PERSON>, the original <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Batman </PERSON>'s campy cohort on the television program; <PERSON> Grayson </PERSON> split with the Caped Crusader in 1984, grabbed a new costume and became Nightwing, head of a new crime-fighting team published under the title `` The New Teen Titans,'' <ORGANIZATION> DC </ORGANIZATION> said. The not-so-dearly departed <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> was <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, a kid off the streets who became <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>'s new ward and the readers' new whipping boy. Angry letters to the editor labeled <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> `` a vindictive, vengeful little brat'' and `` a wimp;'' another letter urged the editors to `` waste him.'' The editors, with the approval of the fans, did just that. <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON> promises <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> wo n't be coming back; the comics, unlike television's `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>,'' will not take the easy way out, he promised `` We're not going to pull a <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>XICHANG, China (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Turbaned peasants trudge by, prodding water buffalo and lugging firewood, and taking little notice of the towering hollow structure from another time and for another universe. Surrounded by green mountains in an isolated corner of <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> province, the Xichang Satellite Center and its 11-story gantry is the takeoff point for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s entry into the international satellite launching market. The base, normally closed to foreigners, is on display as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> enters final negotiations with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on issuing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> licenses for the launch of three <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> satellites. They would be the first American satellites put into orbit by a non-Western country. Agreement has been reached on safeguarding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technology secrets during the launch process and establishing <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s liability in case of accident. Officials meet again in November to work out how to ensure that Chinese prices, much lower than those charged by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space shuttle or European Ariane services, wo n't jeopardize the American commercial launching industry. Xichang's first commercial venture could come as early as 1989 with the launch of <ORGANIZATION> Westar </ORGANIZATION> 6, an old satellite retrieved by the space shuttle in 1984, for AsiaSat, a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> consortium. An Australian company, <ORGANIZATION> AUSSAT </ORGANIZATION>, intends to put two <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> communications satellites into orbit in the early 1990s. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> decided in the mid-1970s to build a rocket base in this remote area because it is easy to defend, sparsely populated and has clear winter days well suited for launches. But while the base is part of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s march to the 21st century, it is surrounded by reminders of the Middle Ages. The site is 40 miles north of Xichang, a small town accessible from the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION> by twice-a-week airplane flights or a 12-hour train ride. On the road from Xichang, women wash clothes in streams, water buffalo pull wooden plows through rice paddies, and barefoot children scamper around mud-baked houses. Farmers spread their grain on the road so truck wheels can help grind it. Between launches, the base looks abandoned. The site, run by the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, employs 1,200, but new buildings to house the 141-foot Long March III rockets and satellites during pre-launch testing are almost empty. Windows in the gantry blown out during the last launch in March have yet to be replaced. About four miles from the launch pad, only two engineers sat at monitors in the gymnasium-like control center. A smaller control center, built into the mountains at the launch site, was not shown to visitors. Site officials say the simplicity of the operation is a main reason for its competitive prices and high success rate. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> reportedly can undercut space shuttle or Ariane prices by as much as 30 percent. <PERSON> Tong </PERSON> <PERSON> Lianjie </PERSON>, deputy director of the center, said the price advantage is `` mainly because our launching facilities are simple, reliable and practical.'' He said the equipment, all produced in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, is relatively cheap and `` technical personnel in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have fairly low salaries. We will not seek a high profit, although of course we will seek a profit.'' <PERSON> Tong </PERSON> gave assurances <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will not pose a threat to other satellite services. `` Because of the limited number of launches, we ca n't be that competitive in the international market.'' Center officials said military control over <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s space program is another reason for its successes. Since 1970, when <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> became the fifth nation after the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to launch a satellite with its own carrier rocket, it has had 23 successful launches and one failure. `` Military discipline is better than that of civilians, who spend half the time smoking cigarettes and the other half working,'' said <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Yongde </PERSON>, deputy director of the center. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s space program, overseen by the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astronautics </ORGANIZATION>, is concentrating on building a more powerful version of the Long March III and adding a second launch pad at Xichang by early 1990. This will give <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> the ability to put a payload of up to 8.8 tons in orbit, compared with 1.4 tons at present and 12 tons for the space shuttle. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has had feelers about its launching services from more than a dozen countries and has signed an agreement with <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> for future joint development of satellites for the study of Earth.

<TEXT>
 A cartoon shows a government soldier facing a guerrilla. Each holds an assault rifle, but piled on the soldier's bent back are a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military adviser, a human rights monitor, and papers documenting rights abuses. The guerrilla stands tall, unencumbered. The drawing in the office of Col. <PERSON> Mauricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON>, chief of operations for the joint chiefs of staff, illustrates how human rights are considered a burden by many Salvadoran officers. Interviews with soldiers, diplomats and judicial authorities suggest that only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure and fear of losing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid keep the army in line. Abuses by the armed forces are far fewer than in the early 1980s, when death squads were killing hundreds of people every month, but two peasant massacres and a gang rape in recent weeks have raised concern. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that hundreds of suspected government opponents have been killed in the past two years by death squads, usually made up of troops and police. `` We're only at the beginning of a long road toward respect for human rights, obviously not at the end of it,'' said Judge <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Zelaya </PERSON>, who is handling the rape case. The increased death squad activity comes with President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> suffering from cancer and leftist leaders re-entering the country after guerrillas agreed to let their political groups participate in a March 1989 presidential election. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, a centrist, has vigorously opposed death squad activity; leftists who fled because they feared for their lives said they felt they could return because death squad activity was down. At the same time, politically motivated slayings by leftist guerrillas have reportedly increased. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> has received more than $ 3 billion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic and military aid this decade, more than any country in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lawmakers have said continued aid depends on growing respect for civil liberties. Officers and troops are not afraid to say they see respect for human rights as a burden. `` It limits our action,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> of the elite <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> <PERSON> Batallion </PERSON> during a recent patrol of guerrilla-dominated hills in northern <LOCATION> Morazan </LOCATION> province. Cpl. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said thousands of civilians killed by death squads in the early 1980s `` deserved what they got.'' Paratrooper Sgt. <PERSON> Mauricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Orellana </PERSON> said he favored `` the 1932 solution'' to defeat leftist guerrillas at war with the U.S.-backed government. He was referring to the slaying, by forces of then-dictator <PERSON> Maximiliano </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, of up to 20,000 peasants to quell a rebellion by a few hundred against landowners. One recent massacre took place Sept. 21, when soldiers detained most of the residents of the hamlet of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and accused them of collaborating with rebels. The soldiers took seven men and three women to a ravine, tied them up and killed them with grenades and rifle fire, according to neighbors and relatives of the dead. Seven were shot in the head from less than six inches away, an autopsy showed. A judge issued arrest warrants for four soldiers, but none has been handed over to judicial authorities. Human rights groups said they feared the investigation into the massacre _ the first mass killing of civilians in four years _ would make ordinary soldiers scapegoats and not focus on the responsible officers. <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Watch </LOCATION>, a private organization that monitors rights in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>, issued a report on <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> on Oct. 2. It said killings declined between 1984 and late 1987 before rising again and notes that no Salvadoran officer or death squad member has been prosecuted and punished for a human rights violation. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said dumped bodies frequently are found decapitated, dismembered, strangled or showing marks of rape or torture, such as burns and machete wounds. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said death squads intimidate government opponents by publishing `` death lists'' in newspaper advertisements and delivering coffins to the homes of intended victims. <PERSON> Zelaya </PERSON> has been handling the case of a 20-year-old who says she was raped by 13 soldiers in the town of <LOCATION> Apastepeque </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zelaya </PERSON> asked the commander of the cavalry regiment whose soldiers allegedly raped the woman for the names of the men on duty the day of the attack. He received no response. In the most recent incident, several men in army uniforms arrived the night of Oct. 14 in the hamlet of <LOCATION> Tres </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ceibas </LOCATION>, 11 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, and pulled four young men from their homes. Minutes later, several shots were heard. Relatives found the bodies of the four, shot in the head, about 40 yards away. Rights groups blamed the army. The armed forces said the killers were guerrillas masquerading as soldiers. The <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> has noted a sharp rise in politically motivated slayings of civilians this year. Execution-style killings of civilians by the rebels are likewise up sharply. However, the guerrillas usually take responsibility for such slayings, which they call `` bringing to justice.''

 The popularity of occultism, including devil worship, is growing among <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s young, and a newspaper said some even engage in the practices during breaks at school. Parents, public officials and church leaders say 10,000 teen-agers may be involved in occult practices ranging from seances to `` black sabbaths'' in which animals are sacrificed at cemeteries. A front-page report Oct. 8 in the influential <PERSON> Frankfurter </PERSON> <PERSON> Allgemeine </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeitung </PERSON> carried the headline, `` The Occult Is Spreading in Our Schools.'' It cited instances of pupils using breaks between classes for occult practices and said: `` Participants withdraw from other teen-agers. Their thoughts constantly revolve around the puzzling world of the spirits.'' In September, a meeting of the national parents' council issued a statement declaring: `` The rise of occultism and magic practices -LRB- among pupils -RRB- indicates spiritual and psychological deficits in our society.'' <PERSON> Hans-Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuser </PERSON>, spokesman for the North-Rhine <LOCATION> Westphalia </LOCATION> state culture ministry, said: `` Teens are using occult beliefs as they would a drug. This is more than just an individual case or a passing fad.'' He said officials the number of reports from schools was growing, especially from religion teachers. `` Often the pupils themselves get scared they might have gone too far in their occult practices and turn to their religion teachers for help,'' <PERSON> Neuser </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone. Religion is a subject in most West German public schools. Occult practices among teen-agers `` range from experimentation with pendulums or glasses to devil-worship ceremonies calling for animal sacrifice,'' <PERSON> Neuser </PERSON> said. The first practice mentioned involves calling on spirits to guide a dangling pendulum to letters or words placed beneath it. In other ceremonies, spirits of deceased friends or relatives are asked to move a glass, coins, or a table in response to certain questions. Among factors blamed for the turn to occultism are youth unemployment, broken homes and pessimism about the future. Two teen-age members of a group practicing devil worship were convicted of murder by a <LOCATION> Muenster </LOCATION> regional court in October 1987. They slit the wrists and throat of another cult member in what was to be a group suicide. Youngsters killed a cat during a `` black sabbath'' at a Dortmund cemetery and ripped out its intestines, the <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sonntag </ORGANIZATION> reported on Feb. 21. <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON>, the weekly news magazine, published a photograph Oct. 12, 1987, of a note it said was written by a ninth-grader in Lahnstein and intercepted by her teacher. `` I asked <PERSON> Lucifer </PERSON> yesterday who is possessed by the devil,'' it said, and listed the names of 11 other pupils, the magazine reported. The Rev. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Views </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION> said: `` At least 10,000 teen-agers are involved to one degree or another in various occult practices,'' A Lutheran pastor in <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION>, the Rev. <PERSON> Hans-Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruppert </PERSON>, said teen-age adherence to traditional religions is declining in concert with occultism's rise. `` Teens are in increasing numbers turning away from traditional religion and turning to the occult as a replacement,'' he said. `` We have to increase contact with them through church youth groups and by strengthening their bonds to religion. The danger is that these children may continue drifting away from society.'' <PERSON> Neuser </PERSON> expressed fear of a deeper effect: `` This involvement happens while the youngster is still forming a sense of values and responsibility. If distant powers are supposedly controlling his behavior, he never has to take responsibility for his actions.''

 In the Ultra Orthodox neighborhood of <LOCATION> Mea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shearim </LOCATION>, a bearded man in a black coat and hat used a stick to rip down a political poster, prompting an angry outburst from a passer-by. `` I do n't mind campaign posters, but this is a personal attack,'' explained Rabbi <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> <PERSON> Shlesinger </PERSON> as he tore down the poster, which attacked a rabbi aligned with the Agudat <PERSON> Yisrael </PERSON> party. The incident reflects increasing tensions in the campaign leading up to Tuesday's elections, especially among religious parties whose swing votes may determine the next prime minister. The campaign in religious areas has been marked by telephone threats and vandalism, including swastikas painted on walls. Apart from the religious tensions, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> has been doused with water and targeted by stone-throwers. Nine hecklers were arrested for blocking <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' car on Tuesday. Religious parties are expected to control 13 to 15 pivotal seats in the 120-seat parliament, or Knesset. If election results between the big parties are as close as expected, both <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>'s left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bloc </ORGANIZATION> will court the religious parties to try to form a ruling coalition This will give the religious parties influence far beyond their numbers, especially in legislation touching on education and social affairs. Balconies, doors and walls are covered with colorful campaign symbols and posters in the normally staid <LOCATION> Mea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shearim </LOCATION> neighborhood of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and in the religious town of <LOCATION> Bnai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brak </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. But some of the writing on the rough, ochre walls is threatening: `` Death to the leftists,'' says one. Another slogan warns a leading politicians, `` Your blood will be spilled.'' The issues in Mea Shearim are distinctly different from the war and peace questions being debated by Labor and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>. On one wall, a swastika was placed next to the name of the <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, a liberal party with a strong stand against religious coercion such as the forced closing of theaters on the Sabbath. `` Murder the pathologists and archaeologists,'' said one scrawl, underscoring Ultra Orthodox demands to ban autopsies and prevent archaeological digs near cemeteries. The issue pits Agudat <PERSON> Yisrael </PERSON>, which holds two parliament seats, against a splinter group, <PERSON> Degel </PERSON> <PERSON> HaTorah </PERSON>. Agudat <PERSON> Yisrael </PERSON> accused its opponents of sending hit squads to vandalize property and attack Agudat followers. The independent Nation newspaper said the squads consisted of men with sticks and metal bars. <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravitz </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Degel </PERSON> <PERSON> HaTorah </PERSON>, denied the allegations. `` We tell our people not to hit back, even if they get blows,'' he said. In television ads, religious parties have stressed the need for more financial support to yeshiva seminaries and attacked social permissiveness they say has led to drug problems. Religiously observant voters account for about 20 percent of the 2.9 million eligible voters, and most of their political factions have drifted to the right in recent years. But leaders do not rule out a deal with Labor. `` Likud is closer to our views, but I do n't say now that Labor ca n't change this,'' Rabbi <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeev </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON>, leader of the Agudat <PERSON> Yisrael </PERSON>. Labor members have been resistant to Orthodox demands for <LOCATION> Sabbath </LOCATION> observance and legislation outlawing non-Orthodox conversions. But <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> said in an interview in his <LOCATION> Bnai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brak </LOCATION> apartment that it was `` very important that the country should at least publicly maintain an appearance of Judaism'' by observing religious law. The only liberal religious party is the <ORGANIZATION> Meimad </ORGANIZATION>, a new group that broke away from the larger <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Rippel </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Meimad </ORGANIZATION> candidate for parliament, said his party would try to heal the rift between religious and secular Jews. The party's views on the future of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> are close to those of Labor. `` Although we believe that the land of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> belongs to us, we are willing to make territorial concessions for peace,'' he said.

 <PERSON> Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> Saint </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> played it safe with streamlined classics in his ready-to-wear show for next summer. Short and edited down to essentials, the show Wednesday was a relief after other presentations that dragged out a hundred ways to create draped, flowered sheaths for a sex kitten. Saint <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON>'s fashion statement was short and pithy. And the clothes often looked like simpler versions of his last couture collection, just as deftly cut in their own way. In day wear, he led off with mariner-inspired suits _ in navy or white broadcloth pants or skirts just above the knee _ with a slightly fitted battle jacket or fitted blazer, both with brass buttons, and topped with jaunty sailors berets. Saint <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> kept to his favorite shaped shoulders and short skirts, though he also dropped some hemlines in fluid, flared or pleated skirts to below the knee and longer _ to midcalf length in some pretty white belted sundresses with circular skirts. Saint <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON>'s silk jersey sheath just barely caressed the body. In tiny stripes, it was crisscrossed by diagonal buttoned piping. A perfect little navy pleated dress with a white collar and bow could not have been simpler, yet had the master's touch. Saint <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> did not go in for the pyramidal trouser line sweeping <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, but kept his pants long and straight in suits or narrow and cropped, matador style. For this peppy new line, he teamed the cropped pants with fitted jackets that had big puffy sleeves in colors like bright yellow and turquoise damasked cotton pique. With few exceptions, the color themes were played in a low key. Black, navy and white took precedence, with autumnal hues of beige, khaki and ochre not far behind. Jazzy colors popped up in bicolored suits in shades of turquoise, lime or corn yellow. The one flame red cotton poplin dress with balloon sleeves was a standout among all the sober clothes. There's good news for those who ca n't afford Saint Laurent couture: In ready-to-wear, he offered an excellent version of the tuxedo dress he did in 20 different ways for couture. Less successful but still fun was the bright bicolored suit with grape-bunch embroidery on shoulders and pockets, and even striated grape-shaped buttons. Catching the mood of the times, Saint <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> concentrated on simple crepe de chine dinner dresses rather than rhinestone-encrusted ball gowns loaded with flounces, frou-frou and lace. Short kimono-wrapped silk dresses or variations on the shirtwaist in silk had a kind of studied throwaway simplicity. For a finale, there were gold-belted draped white crepe gowns. The show left some in the audience hungry for more, but there was nothing extraneous. Everything in this understated collection was wearable and chic.

 Equipped with a gun, a nightstick and a regulation-size teddy bear, police officers in this town boast they're ready for any emergency. The idea of driving around with stuffed animals may not inspire a new television series _ `` T.J. Teddy''? _ but <PERSON> Tewksbury </PERSON> police officers are receptive to the the idea if it means helping children deal with traumatic events. `` When you've got a little kid who has been in an accident and who is hysterical, it's a good idea,'' said Officer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>. However, he added, the bears `` will stay in the trunk.'' The town's 13 police cars are equipped with two regulation, 7-inch teddy bears apiece. Police say the bears' first week on duty already has produced positive results. `` It calms the kids down a lot and creates a good feeling towards the police, too,'' said Deputy Police Chief <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON>. `` A lieutenant gave one to a child of a mother being interviewed concerning some domestic problems at her house.'' The bears were donated to the force by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pioneers </ORGANIZATION>, a charitable group whose members are current and retired phone company employees. The police department calls the group when a bear is given to a child so it can be replaced.

 Thieves stole 25 pumpkins from <PERSON> Ion </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Tharp </PERSON>, but the couple made out like bandits after receiving 32 pumpkins from sympathetic zoo workers and others from anonymous donors. `` Halloween is supposed to be a time of fun for children,'' said <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON>, a volunteer at Binder Park Zoo who helped arrange the delivery. `` Stolen pumpkins are n't fun.'' The Pennfield Township couple had arranged the 25 pumpkins on their front porch and yard to surprise two of their grandchildren, who arrived Wednesday for a two-week visit. The Tharps awoke Sunday to find the pumpkins stolen. The pumpkin pilferage was reported locally the next day, and donations soon followed. Two staffers from the zoo, which had stockpiled about 1,100 pumpkins for a Halloween event billed as the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zoo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boo </LOCATION>, delivered 32 pumpkins to the Tharps on Tuesday night. `` It's nice to know that there's a lot of good people out there,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Tharp </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is seeking agreement from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on an on-site inspection proposal his administration says will make a strategic arms reduction treaty verifiable while shielding `` legitimate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> secrets and interests.'' State Department Spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said Wednesday that the president recently made a number of verification-related decisions, `` including some on the approach we will take to so-called suspect site inspections.'' But he declined to spell out details while the U.S.-Soviet arms reduction talks are continuing in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. The two sides are seeking to work out 50 percent cuts in their arsenals of strategic, or intercontinental, nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said that while `` considerable progress'' has been made at the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks, `` much still remains to be done.'' `` Our intention in the START talks is to flesh out the details of our position, including the details of a START verification regime, so that there will be a complete <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position on the table in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` START will have the most extensive verification regime in history, well beyond that of the verification measures of the INF -LRB- Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces -RRB- treaty.'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> added that `` We are convinced that these provisions will make the treaty effectively verifiable. At the same time, we must be careful to protect legitimate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> secrets and interests. ... We believe the proper balance has been made between those two considerations.'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has completed its negotiating position on space-based defenses with proposals intended to `` complement our initiative to permit the development, testing and deployment of all space-based sensors ...'' `` This element does not represent any change in longstanding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy on the ABM -LRB- Anti-Ballistic Missile -RRB- Treaty and its proper interpretation,'' he said, adding that administration policy on the conduct of the Strategic Defense Initiative, as worked out with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, also is unchanged. `` Testing of space-based components, which is permitted by the ABM Treaty, does not represent deployment of such components,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said and added: `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy remains that we will not accept any restrictions on SDI beyond those of the ABM Treaty.''

 A money shortage is threatening the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> less than a month into the government's new fiscal year, although officials say no decision has been made on whether to close offices. An employee union said Wednesday it had obtained information from the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, parent agency of the weather service, indicating that as many as 40 weather offices could be in jeopardy. <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Witten </PERSON> confirmed that the agency is facing financial problems and said many options are being considered for saving money. He said no decisions have been made on any closings. A recently approved pay raise for federal workers, coupled with budget cutbacks, is expected to leave the weather service about $ 25 million short of its needs for the fiscal year that started Oct. 1. `` Basically, we're looking at the operation and seeing what we can do to meet that shortfall,'' <PERSON> Witten </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` Obviously the sooner you do it in the fiscal year the better, but the fact is we have n't decided on any specific reductions at this time. We're looking at a lot of options,'' he said. <PERSON> Witten </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has instituted a hiring freeze and is considering offering early retirement to employees who may be eligible to leave before the normal retirement age, as immediate ways to save money. Salaries are by far the largest item in the agency's budget. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement claiming that plans have been drafted to close as many as 40 of the 191 weather offices. Such a series of closings could have a serious impact on forecasting, particularly affecting airline operations, the group said. The Weather Service offices collect hourly observations, which are transmitted to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Suitland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, where a national forecast is developed. That is then sent to local forecast offices, which use it along with their local observations to issue local weather forecasts and alerts. This is not the first time <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> offices have been threatened with closings in efforts to save money. Each time, however, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has voted money to keep the offices open. Among the weather data collection offices that may be threatened, according to the employees group, are: Eastern region: <LOCATION> Mansfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Elkins </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; Reading, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Lynchburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Parkersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>.

 The secret Stealth bomber is n't even scheduled to be publicly unveiled until next month, but it already has become a target for critics who say it is n't needed and may not work. The latest complaints were raised in a report Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientists </ORGANIZATION>, a private group which in the past has been sharply critical of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration arms control policies and defense decisions. `` There is no role for the B-2,'' the report said, using the formal name of the plane designed as a `` flying wing'' and made of high-tech materials that make the plane difficult to detect on radar. `` We should probably use the first B-2 prototype to gain some practical experience with this novel military technology, but there seems little reason to proceed now with the production of this bomber,'' it said. The Pentagon is scheduled to unveiled the bomber publicly Nov. 22 at the <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Palmdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. Thus far, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has only released an artist's drawing. Congressional critics have raised questions about the plane's future, particularly as cost estimates have increased Both the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committees </ORGANIZATION> have backed the planes, but the two Democratic-controlled panels have also asked the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> to justify rising costs and assure <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that technical problems can be solved. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> is tentatively planning to buy 132 of the planes. The first estimates in 1981 were that the fleet would cost about $ 22 billion, but the figure rose to $ 43 billion by 1987 and the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> now estimates that 132 B-2s will cost $ 68.8 billion. That would make the B-2 the most expensive weapon system ever built. Production is tentatively scheduled to begin early next year. The B-2, along with the B-1 bomber, is intended to replace the aging B-52 as the newest components of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> three-pronged nuclear deterrent, which also includes submarine-launched missiles and land-based missiles such as the MX. The report by the <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientists </ORGANIZATION> said, `` The secrecy surrounding this project, intended to protect technological secrets from the Soviets, is also hiding an expensive project of dubious merits from Americans.'' <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials, when asked for comment, said they had not yet seen the FAS report. The FAS noted that `` two missions for the B-2 have emerged from the veil of secrecy.'' `` Some argue that the B-2 is needed to offset improvements in Soviet air defenses. ... Others argue that the B-2 is needed in order to attack Soviet mobile missiles such as the SS-24 and SS-25. Neither of these arguments in favor of the B-2 is particularly compelling,'' it said. The Soviets are likely to upgrade their air defenses, but even when they do, they will still be vulnerable to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons such as nuclear-tipped cruise missiles and the B-1, the <ORGANIZATION> FAS </ORGANIZATION> said. Using the B-2 to hit Soviet mobile weapons is risky because the plane would needed targeting information from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> satellites, the <ORGANIZATION> FAS </ORGANIZATION> said. Those satellites could be knocked out by <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> weapons during the early stages of any war, it said, leaving the B-2 without an effective way to locate its targets. `` In fact, the Stealth bomber is as much a first-strike weapon as the MX. Both systems are intended to destroy Soviet missiles before they can be launched against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> FAS </ORGANIZATION>, which has also been critical of the MX. It concluded that `` the B-2 poses the same dangers as the MX and the Strategic Defense Initiative _ increased risk of nuclear war, further escalation of the arms race; and complication of arms control and reduction.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FAS </ORGANIZATION> study cited what it said are a number of technical concerns about the B-2. `` Problems with the stability of flying wing designs date back to the YB-49 flying wing in the 1940s,'' it noted, citing reports that a companion F-19 Stealth fighter has suffered several crashes. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has not confirmed those crashes. Even should all the problems be solved, `` there are a number of questions regarding the extent to which the B-2 and its stealth technology will be effective,'' it said.

 A tale of two politicians: <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, born and raised in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, moved to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> as a young man, made a career for himself in one of the state's leading industries, raised a family, entered <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> politics and was twice elected to office. He is dogged to this day by skepticism about his claim to be a Texan. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, born and raised in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, moved to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> as a young man, made a career for himself in one of the state's leading industries, raised two families, entered <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> politics and was twice elected to office. Nobody ever suggests that he is not a Californian. In fact, as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> flies off today for a round of pre-election politicking, much of his activity will be focused on the state he first visited as an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> sportscaster covering the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION> in spring training. `` That's his home state. It's felt he can be very helpful here,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> as he outlined the Illinois-born president's itinerary right after the Republican convention in August. But if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s career as an oilman and his two terms as a congressman from a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> district do n't qualify the vice president as a Texan, how come a movie career and two terms as governor of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> make <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> an undisputed Californian? `` I wonder whether it does n't have to do with the important events in one's life whether one considers oneself a native of a particular state,'' says <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heslop </PERSON>, a professor of ethics at <ORGANIZATION> Claremont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKenna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and a specialist in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> voting opinions. `` One of the most important events to all of us, I think, is where one's children go to school. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s children went to school in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.'' Of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s five children, one attended the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>, but the others went to <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>, to <LOCATION> Tulane </LOCATION>, to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> and to <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. There are more reasons for the difference. For one thing, while Texans traditionally look askance at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Englanders </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> was practically settled by Midwesterners. <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION> was once called, in fact, `` The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Colony </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.'' `` The settlers of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> came mainly from the American heartland, from rural and small-town areas,'' historian <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wills </PERSON> wrote, `` but they invented something different, a kind of hick cosmopolis.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was right at home. Both his marriages were to women he met in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, but both were from the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> as he was. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joseph </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> grew up in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Even <PERSON> Louella </PERSON> <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON>, the gossip columnist who chronicled his marriages, was from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s home town of <LOCATION> Dixon </LOCATION>, Ill. Except for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has never maintained a home outside <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> since he signed a six-month contract with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> in 1937. He had a home in <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palisades </LOCATION> before being elected president and plans to divide his time between a home in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and his ranch north of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> starting Jan. 20. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s legal residence is Suite 271 of the Houstonian Hotel and <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, but he purchased a home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, after becoming vice president. Whatever his residence, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporters in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> resent suggestions that he is not one of them. `` <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is really his home and he loves the state,'' <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Farish </PERSON>, whose <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> company handles the vice president's assets in a blind trust, said in a recent interview. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, too, likes to remind <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> audiences that he's `` back home.'' Still, ponder this: When <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spoke at an Italian-American dinner of meat balls and ziti in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, this month, the band unhesitatingly struck up `` <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Here I Come.'' -LRB- The second line is `` Right Back Where I Started From.'' -RRB- If it had been <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, would they have played `` Deep in the Heart of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>?''

<HEAD>Shortage Seen Among Health Care Workers For the Elderly</HEAD>

 Continued low wages and difficult working conditions will lead to a shortage of health aides needed to care for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s elderly, according to a report prepared by advocacy groups. `` This nation is on the brink of a full-blown crisis in caregiving for the chronically ill,'' said <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Glasse </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Older </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, which joined with a government employees' union in commissioning the study `` An exploited, overburdened work force is caring for the frail, the sick and the elderly,'' <PERSON> Glasse </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Glasse </PERSON>'s organization issued the study jointly on Wednesday with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and Municipal Employees. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> McEntee </PERSON>, president of the 1.4 million-member union, said chronic care workers `` are among the most exploited workers in our nation.'' `` The solutions to the crisis are obvious _ a higher minimum wage, improvements in Medicaid reimbursement, more stringent licensing and training requirements,'' he said. The groups' report compiled information from state and federal statistics from 1985 to the present. It painted a bleak picture of the 1.5 million health care aides caring for patients in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s more than 25,000 nursing and private homes. It said the majority of the workers are middle-aged minority women earning just above minimum wage without insurance coverage or overtime. Most leave their health care jobs within five years for those reasons. Given the conditions, <PERSON> Glasse </PERSON> said, it will be difficult to find the 500,000 health care aides the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimates will be needed by the year 2000. The report quoted the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> as saying more than half of nursing homes surveyed already report shortages of nursing aides. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION>, representing organizations providing home care, reported comparable shortages. <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinlan </PERSON>, a consultant who compiled the study, noted that the number of persons requiring paid caretakers is increasing rapidly. She said many family members who otherwise would provide such care now must seek employment to make ends meet.

<HEAD>Democratic Senate Candidates Outdistancing GOP Rivals in Fund
Raising</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Something strange is going on in this year's 33 election contests for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>: Democrats are raising more campaign money than their Republican rivals. By the end of last month, according to financial data reported to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the 33 Democrats running for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats had collected $ 83.6 million toward their campaigns. Their 33 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> opponents had pulled in $ 73.3 million. `` It is unusual,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, communications director for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the party's campaign arm. `` But it's incumbency talking,'' as well as givers' expectations that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will remain under <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> control, he said It is true that incumbents always have an easier time raising campaign money, and that <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> have more incumbents, 15, up for re-election this year than the Republicans, 12. And it also is true that most political analysts are predicting not only that Democrats will hold onto their 54-46 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority, but they may pad it by a seat or two come Nov. 8. <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> incumbents actually fared slightly better than their Democratic counterparts in fund raising. The dozen Republicans averaged $ 3.8 million apiece as of Sept. 30, while the 15 Democratic senators averaged $ 3.4 million. But in nearly every other category _ open-seat races, challengers, and political action committee money _ the Democrats outdistanced their traditionally well-heeled rivals. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> chalks some of the differences up to unusual situations in a handful of states that skew the numbers the Democrats' way, and topping his `` unusual list'' is <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. `` It's like running against a bank,'' he says of the <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> who holds a substantial lead in the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race against <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> minority leader <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bucks </ORGANIZATION> basketball team and heir to a family grocery store chain, spent $ 3 million, most of it his own money, to overcome better-known rivals in the primary, and may top $ 6 million by Election Day. <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON>, who is conceded to be better versed on the issues, was trailing 3-to-1 in fund raising and was down by more than 20 points in the last published statewide poll. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> has sought to make his spending a virtue, saying it means he wo n't be beholden to special interests. `` Nobody's senator but yours,'' is the tagline to his prolific TV spots. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> also points to <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, an open seat where former Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> has been regarded as the prohibitive favorite for years and has been treated by campaign donors more as an incumbent than as an open-seat candidate. <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> had raised $ 2.7 million, compared with $ 192,000 for his lesser-known <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> opponent <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>. In addition, Republicans say the presidential election has diverted attention from bids by quality <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates and made it harder for them to compete for a limited amount of campaign dollars. But Democrats have other explanations for their new-found parity with the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> in fund raising. `` The candidates we recruited are an impressive group of elected officials who have their own political bases and their own fund-raising bases,'' said <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` Democratic challengers are not being outspent 2-to-1 or 3-to-1 like in previous years.'' Democrats, after a slow start, have learned to be competitive for special-interest money, as well, she said. <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> figures show Democratic <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidates overall have received $ 21.4 million from political action committees, while Republicans have collected just $ 17.5 million. The disparity led to a `` woodshed'' session last month at which <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., and chief fund-raiser <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Minn </LOCATION>., called leaders from business PACs to a meeting to scold them for supporting `` We're getting far fewer contributions than the Democrats are,'' said <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>. `` The message -LRB- at the meeting -RRB- was that business PACs should take a serious look at pro-business candidates. That they should look at the philosophies of the people they're giving to.'' Some Capitol Hill observers are predicting that the Democrats' catch-up in raising PAC money will lead Republicans, who have protected the current fund-raising system so far, to throw out the rules in 1989 `` This, I think, will be the last election we have under the current system,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, a political analyst and author of a political newsletter. `` I am convinced we're seeing big-time reform next year. Republicans just are not going to defend PACs any more. They will decide it's in their self interest.'' Republicans are not shut out of the picture entirely when it comes to money, however. Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., tops the money list for all candidates so far this year, having amassed about $ 12 million for his re-election bid, roughly double the amount his challenger, Lt. Gov <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, has raised. And in a hard-fought open seat contest in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, Republican Rep. <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> has outdistanced opponent Rep. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowdy </PERSON> in fund raising and holds a nearly 4-to-1 advantage in cash on hand going into the crucial final weeks of the campaign.

 Is there a market niche among swing voters for a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor who's mounting an unprecedented television sales campaign for himself? Probably not, analysts say, but he's got the right idea. Saturation exposure is `` a perfectly reasonable strategy'' for Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, given his double-digit deficit in the polls and the proximity of Election Day, says <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON>, a political scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>. `` But you've got to have a product to sell. You have to have something people want to buy,'' says <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON>. `` What they may not be accounting for is the fact that most people have apparently concluded that they do n't want <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to be president. Seeing him more often is not going to change that evaluation.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is waging an airwaves war to ward off the closing of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> minds, abetted by TV news and interview shows that are providing him with unprecedented blocks of free exposure to millions of viewers. The invitations are flowing to both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Republican nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the nearly prohibitive favorite, is still weighing whether and where to appear, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is taking on all comers. `` He's going on every TV show he can find except <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>,'' joked <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> government professor, pollster and author of two books about campaign media coverage. `` Do n't get me wrong, he's doing the right thing,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> added. `` But will this turn the election around? Of course not.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> latest extended appearance, 90 minutes on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Nightline'' Tuesday night, drew predictable raves from his own spin doctors and equally predictable put-downs from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> camp `` A terrific session,'' pronounced <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> adviser <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Engelberg </PERSON>. `` He got his pants chewed up,'' declared <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON>. More objective reviewers noted that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> passed up numerous chances during the interview to stress his new populist image as a fighter for `` Main Street'' Americans, a president who would be `` on your side.'' He also failed to reject a <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON> suggestion that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has nailed `` yoabato said. `` That was the dullest interview I've ever seen <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON> conduct. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' answers just were n't that lively or interesting. And he missed so many opportunities to make useful points from his perspective. Something to warm him up, something to make him appear more human.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is running the usual 30-second TV ads and a 5-minute network spot summarizing his appeal. He has already appeared, in addition to `` Nightline,'' on the morning news shows and the <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> talk show on Cable News Network. His wife, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>, was on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Face the Nation.'' His running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, was on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>'' and was interviewed on the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> `` Evening News'' Wednesday night. A new <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll indicates about a quarter of the nation's probable voters still classify themselves as undecided. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will have a few more shots at them, including lengthy appearances on the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> evening newscasts and an interview with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> on the Fox network Nov. 6. `` Everything depends on his performance and how interested swing voters or soft <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporters are in hearing him make his pitch,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>, a Republican consultant and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> commentator. `` He has everything to gain because he has nothing to lose,'' <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> added. `` He's behind in every poll. He's behind in more than 40 states. His only hope is to get as much exposure for himself as possible and hope that what he says has some resonance with voters.'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, a self-professed Democrat, said he ca n't imagine <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> attracting anyone into his column `` by force of personality. But he ca n't hide now, he's got to come out. He's got to be <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. And he will go down in an honorable defeat.''

 An anti-nuclear physicians' group on Wednesday urged President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to take drastic steps to improve safety at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear weapons-making facilities, where production virtually has halted because of safety concerns. Four major plants in the 14-facility manufacturing complex have been wholly or partially closed for safety reasons and the production of nuclear weapons has ground to a halt, according to officials at the Energy and Defense departments. The anti-nuclear group, Physicians for Social Responsibility, said in a statement that contamination and dubious safety procedures at the plants `` have direct and potentially devastating medical implications.'' `` They constitute a public health emergency,'' said <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Geiger </PERSON>, a member of the committee and a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Geiger </PERSON> said not enough studies have been conducted to determine whether nuclear wastes from the sites have caused cancer or other illnesses among workers or nearby residents. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has estimated it would cost $ 66 billion to $ 110 billion in the long-term to clean up the waste and upgrade the facilities, and congressional estimates have run as high as $ 170 billion. In a letter to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the physicians' group urged the administration to give the newly created <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> the power to close down any <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> nuclear facility it deems `` not ... in compliance with safety, public health, occupations and environmental standards.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> created the board under the defense authorization bill for fiscal 1989 to monitor <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION>'s beleaguered nuclear weapons program, which manufactures atomic weapons for the Pentagon. The board does not have powers of enforcement. DOE is reviewing the safety and operation of all of its plants to report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by mid-December on whether to close any of them. The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday said an early draft of that report calls for permanent closing of two facilities, one in <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and another near <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, where work was interrupted earlier this year because of health and safety reasons. At the Rocky Flats Plant near <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, two workers and an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> inspector suffered low-level radioactive contamination on Sept. 29, after which authorities closed Building 771, a plutonium reprocessing facility there. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> cited the exposure of the workers when it announced the closing earlier this month. However, the department was aware of severe problems at the plant even before the accident, a department official said late Wednesday. `` It's my understanding that -LRB- the contamination of the workers and the inspector -RRB- was essentially a catalytic incident'' that prompted the closing of the facility, said <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anson </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, the chief <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said in an interview. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> inspectors had been in the plant several times before the accident `` and had come up with quite a long list of changes. We believe the contractor -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- was sincere and committed to making these changes, but we felt the progress -LRB- assessed after the accident -RRB- had n't been as rapid as we would like to see. So that feeling led to the conversations that resulted in the shutdown of the facility.'' <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Heintz </PERSON> on Wednesday emphasized that although Building 771, the plutonium reprocessing building, is closed down, that does not necessarily mean the plant's operations are halted. However, he said he could n't provide more specifics because the quantity of plutonium stockpiled was classified. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in Thursday's editions quoted a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report as saying that an inspector, identified in the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report as <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Krupar </PERSON>, found a series of `` very serious'' violations at Rocky Flats that left `` no margins for safety.'' His concerns included `` slow and unskilled'' work by employees assigned to monitor radiation levels; radiological monitors that were `` unchecked, out of service and out of calibration;'' `` haphazard, inconsistent'' posting of warning signs outside rooms with radioactive contamination, `` electrical safety is dangerously managed,'' and `` attitudes are complacent.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report was prepared for Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON>, D-Colo., and a copy was obtained by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>: `` I have n't seen the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report, but it's my understanding that it essentially recaps the findings of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>'s inspectors at Rocky Flats.'' Workers at the Feed Materials Production Center in <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>, about 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, have been striking the plant for a month, forcing it to suspend operations. And <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> has urged that federal authorities close the Fernald plant, which according to DOE documents filed in court, regularly has dumped radioactive waste into the water and air. A DOE spokesman, <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Callicott </PERSON>, said that because the department's study on whether to close any nuclear facilities was not complete, `` it is premature to comment on its recommendations.'' Two other major weapons facilities have been closed. The three reactors at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, where the department manufactures plutonium and tritium for nuclear weapons, were shut down earlier this year for safety reasons. The department is working on plans to restart one of the reactors in December, although details have not been finalized, <PERSON> Callicott </PERSON> said. The department closed down the other reactor at which it had been manufacturing plutonium and tritium, in <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, and has no current plans to reopen it, officials said. The physicians' committee urged <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to `` prohibit the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> from restarting any of its reactors at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, or reopening facilities presently closed at <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> until -LRB- an independent commission -RRB- completes an evaluation of the public health, occupational and environmental safety risks of the continued operation of these facilities.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said the president's office had not received the letter from the physicians' committee and could not comment directly on it. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> is on top of this situation,'' said <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>. Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> has developed a plan to check out all the sites, to issue a report in December on all of the sites, and rank the sites in order of safety.'' `` The bottom line is that the president has said that we will not operate an unsafe nuclear plant, and we will not,'' said <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said they have adequate supplies of plutonium, but face critical shortages of tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen used to boost the power of nuclear explosions.

 When <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gets wound up, odd words sometimes happen. This can sentence a campaign crowd to some bizarre sentences, but the partisans do n't seem to care. So they cheered the vice president in <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the other day when he explained: `` In terms of the environment, I will be a good president for the environment because I know in what kind of decade to leave the kids, not what we're in right today. `` I will do better,'' he said. And in <LOCATION> Williston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, on taxes: `` You know the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> _ I do n't know why they call it Taxachusetts _ I did n't name it Taxachusetts. The people in Taxachusetts named it Taxachusetts.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign days generally begin with a smooth, polished performance dealing with a single theme _ economics this week. The Republican presidential nominee speaks from a text, sticking to the script by using a TelePrompTer. He's an orderly orator most mornings, scripted and steady. But the relatively mild-mannered campaigner vanishes later in the day, when it comes time to deliver the standard, everyday campaign speech to the rally at the firehouse, or the airport, or the Republican barbeque. For example, here's <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> taunting Democratic nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for his late-campaign counteroffensive accusing the Republicans of lying about his record: `` These guys can dish it out but they ca n't take it. I'll tell you something _ I love it ...'' Perhaps he did, but within a day his campaign strategists had put together a dossier and staged a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> news conference to defend their advertisements and insist that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was the liar. And on Wednesday they began broadcasting a counter-counter ad that begins: `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> deliberately misled 62 million Americans in the last debate.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s sometimes fractured campaign rhetoric usually shows up in his set, standard speech, the one delivered to the daily rallies, routine in any presidential campaign. Those speeches are essentially a shorthand review of what's gone before, a compilation of the lines that worked best along the way. They are like pieces of a puzzle assembled into one speech, 15 minutes or so of the candidate's best applause lines. And they become as predictable as a tape recording in most campaigns. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has put the excitement back. It's as though a few of the pieces of his set speech came from another puzzle. `` Hey, listen, I forgot, I ca n't let one event go by ...'' he told a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> rally in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, Tuesday, and hit <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for criticizing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> five years ago. He almost forgot the Pledge of Allegiance, too, but not quite. `` I think it is good to have children sign the pledge _ say the pledge.'' In <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, on Wednesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> thanked a crowd for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s hospitality, saying, `` You've been very pleasant to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> family, we've been here, thousands of us, five kids, one wife, me, back again.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has taken to counting the days until the Nov. 8 election, although not always well. With 13 days to go, he urged Republicans in <LOCATION> Billings </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, to turn out their vote, `` Literally, 11 days and an hour, we're going to know the answer to this.'' That certainly would make him the first to know.

<TEXT>
 An independent group supporting <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plans to flood cable stations in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> with ads denouncing the military stands of Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, whose campaign is denouncing another new <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ad as `` a cynical lie.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday its ad will run 2,400 times Nov. 1-7 on cable stations in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The production and time buys cost $ 100,000. The spot lists five weapons systems it said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opposes and says `` a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> group calls for a $ 75 billion cut in defense,'' a reference to the Boston-based Jobs with <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> on whose board <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> serves. `` As former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION>, I know that such cuts will cripple our country,'' retired Adm. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moorer </PERSON> says in the ad. `` We can not afford to have <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sitting across from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. We must support <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for president. It's a matter of national security.'' The pro-Bush group has spent $ 2.5 million on ads supporting the Republican, including earlier ones running under the name Americans for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign officials have filed complaints against the group and disavowed its activities. A new ad accusing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of raiding his state's pension fund, which began airing Tuesday night in spot markets around the country, drew protests from both the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign and The Wall Street Journal. The ad says <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` deliberately misled'' 62 million Americans in the last debate by denying the raiding charge and calls him `` unbelievable.'' The spot features a debate clip and a quote from the Journal that `` it is indisputable that $ 27 million moved out of the nation's most underfunded state pension system, so that the governor could claim to have balanced the fiscal 1988 budget.'' <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> bureau chief for the <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, said the newspaper is protesting the ad to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign becauses it creates the impression that the quotes came from the front page when in fact they came from the opinion pages. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign said the incident in question was `` a budgetary transfer'' of an unanticipated surplus and had no effect on the level of pension benefits or the security of the system. Also on the ad front, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said it is suing the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign to stop threats of legal action against radio stations airing ads attacking the Democrat's stands on gun control and crime. The ads are running in more than 20 states. The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> is seeking a judicial declaration that the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign's threats of legal action are baseless and the First Amendment would protect radio stations against any liability if legal action were taken. The lawsuit also seeks an injunction to stop further threats of libel suits against the radio stations. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' general counsel, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, has told the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> it is distorting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' positions and wrongly attributing statements to him. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign officials in several states have told radio stations to stop running the ads.

 Republican presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Wednesday that Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sounds like a man `` just itching to repeal'' the income tax cuts of the past eight years. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his election would be a mandate against tax increases. In an economics lecture stressing his week-long campaign theme, the vice president said the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor `` never met a payroll'' and does n't understand the impact of taxes on business. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaigned in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, with 20 electoral votes at stake on Nov. 8, before heading for rallies in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, and Billings, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, small states where his aides said the race could be close. `` We're going to shore up our support,'' said press secretary <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told more than 1,600 people at the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policies have produced astounding economic growth despite Democratic `` voices of doom.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee said he would seek to spur that growth by cutting the capital gains tax rate, a proposal <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has denounced repeatedly as a tax break for the wealthy. Capital gains, realized on the sale of such assets as stocks and real estate, are taxed like any other income under tax legislation that took effect last year. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to restore preferential treatment for capital gains, cutting the top rate from 33 percent to 15 percent. He said such a move has been `` endorsed by everyone,'' from <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, from <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` It's not a tax break for the rich, it is a break for those who want to have a job in this country,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Unfortunately, my opponent's only experience with business is regulating it and taxing it. `` He's never run a business. ... He's never met a payroll. He does n't understand how when you're starting out, you need people to join you in taking a risk. So he paints my proposal as an effort to help the rich.'' `` Wrong,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He said most capital gains are realized by people who earn less than $ 50,000 a year. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign on the other hand cites a <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> study concluding more than half the capital gains are realized by the 1 percent of richest Americans. As for income taxes, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said rates have been cut by an average 27 percent since <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office in 1981, and the results in new jobs and economic growth `` have been staggering.'' `` Despite the certifiable success of our tax cuts in unleashing the longest recovery in our history, my opponent thinks they were a disaster,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, recalling <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' criticism of the cuts during the Democratic primary campaign. `` Those sound to me like the words of someone who is just itching to repeal one of the most successful economic policies in our history,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He said the reason is that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is proposing `` mandated new spending'' that would cost the government and business billions upon billions of dollars. `` If I am elected in 13 days eight hours and 22 minutes from now ... I will work with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, telling them the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, in electing me, voted against a tax increase,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He said the voters also would be say they wanted the president to have line-item veto authority, so he could delete specific spending items from an appropriations bill without vetoing the entire measure. Answering written questions, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit should shrink under current policies. `` I'm convinced that this is on the right track without further legislation,'' he said. `` I have in the past supported the voluntary restraint agreements as they affect autos and I am open-minded on that question. But I am not one who favors protection.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> refused to say who he would nominate as secretary of state on the ground that such a disclosure might break rules against promising appointments. The Cabinet post is widely believed to be earmarked for <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, his campaign chairman, former treasury secretary and a long-time <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> associate from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that to answer questions about appointments to a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration `` conveys a sense of overconfidence that I do not feel.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wrapped up his campaigning with a rally in Billings, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, repeating that that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> could raise income taxes. `` Do n't elect him because he just might take that tax cut away from the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said again. At <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> on a gymnasium stage with <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> Republicans and a dozen impassive Indians in full headress, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also renewed his pledge to fight against gun control. `` I'm a sportsman, I'm a hunter, like to do it,'' he said. `` And I do n't believe we need the federal govenment going forward with gun control legislation.'' Urging <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> Republicans to turn out the vote on Nov. 8, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had a little trouble with his arithmetic. `` Literally, 11 days and an hour, we're going to know the answer to this,'' he said of an election 13 days away. In Billings, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Two taxied to the runway for a flight to <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, but then turned back when the galley crew reported gas fumes in the rear of the plane. Fire fighting crews were sent in and the engines were turned off while an inspection was made. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other members of his entourage remained on board. After about 20 minutes, it was determined that strong cross winds had blown fuel fumes into the aircraft and they would dissipate on takeoff, as they did when the plane departed. Some time after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> left, the press plane chartered by media covering the vice president was held on the ground because of high winds that prevented takeoff, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> officials said. At a Republican rally in the stockyards in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> challenged what he said were Democratic proposals to impose supply controls on American farmers. He said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> stands for such tightened controls and `` I do n't believe he should be against the American farmer.'' `` We are not going to pull the rug out from under the American farmer and go to some kind of supply management,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told several hundred people at the stockyards rally.

<HEAD>Ex-Bomber, Vegetable Vendor Among Offbeat Candidates for Israeli
Parliament</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s wide-open electoral system, a man who once threw a bomb into parliament and an 89-year-old former vegetable vendor who wants to throw a monkey wrench into parliamentary rules are running for office. Their parties are among several special interest groups counting on single-issue platforms to woo undecided voters in the Nov. 1 parliamentary elections. Others entered in the race include parties that want to ban income taxes, improve prisoners' rights, get rid of one-third of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s legislators and boost pensions for retirees. The small parties are encouraged by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s system of proportional representation, which awards a seat in the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>, or parliament, to any group that wins 1 percent of the vote, about 24,000 ballots. Pollsters say it is unlikely parties with limited appeal will succeed. `` I do n't expect any of them to be in the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION> after the elections,'' said political analyst <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Elazar </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Elazar </PERSON> conceded: `` They're very entertaining ... a little like the dog-and-pony act in a vaudeville show.'' The election is being contested by 27 parties, including 14 that now hold parliamentary seats. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> are expected to split about 60 percent of the vote One of the more obscure hopefuls is the <ORGANIZATION> Topaz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> diamond </ORGANIZATION> polisher <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Duak </PERSON>, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison in 1957 after a hand grenade he tossed into the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION> wounded then <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders <PERSON> Golda </PERSON> <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Gurion </PERSON>. <PERSON> Duak </PERSON>, who says his party represents Jews of <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> origin, told election officials he walked across country to collect the 1,500 signatures needed to get on the ballot. When he registered for the elections, <PERSON> Duak </PERSON> pulled a list of 2,000 signatures from a weather-beaten backpack and said: `` I do n't have a phone, but you can reach me at the place where I'm studying.'' Another small party hoping for a break is the `` Silent Force Movement,'' which placed 89-year-old <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanhi </PERSON> at top of its ticket to highlight its protest against irrational laws and rules. Party founder <PERSON> Yaakov </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON> said one such rule could make <PERSON> Sanhi </PERSON>, a retired vegetable stand owner who has never held office, speaker of parliament because the post goes to the oldest member until a permanent speaker is elected. Gross also wants to end income tax because he said it encourages cheating and `` immoral behavior.'' He said he named his party the `` Silent Force'' because people kept telling him, `` We've never heard of you.'' The party got some attention by choosing to identify itself with a Hebrew letter that is sometimes used as a phallic symbol. `` It was appropriate for a protest party,'' <PERSON> Gross </PERSON> said. `` We figured we could use it in our campaign ads, as long as we used it in a very delicate way.'' Two other offbeat candidates, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Tayar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Benzion </PERSON> <PERSON> Koren </PERSON>, have each failed in running for Parliament seats twice before. <PERSON> Tayar </PERSON>, a restaurateur, says he is a champion of the poor, `` just like <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Koren </PERSON>, whose goal is better housing for <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> veterans </ORGANIZATION>, is enough of a believer to have sold his <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> newstand to pay the $ 7,700 registration fee. Some pollsters say a few small groups may pick up one or two seats if they represent large special interest groups and enough voters become disenchanted with Labor and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Aba </PERSON> <PERSON> Gefen </PERSON>, a retired civil servant who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Pensioners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, hopes to win enough seats on the strength of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 400,000 retirees to play a role in forming a coalition government. `` If we hold the balance of power after the elections, we'll have an influence,'' said <PERSON> Gefen </PERSON>, who wants to increase pension benefits. However, if the <ORGANIZATION> Pensioners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> fails to get a seat its ballots will be ignored, and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials say such wasted votes could cost them much needed support. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> also worries about little parties that will cut into its backing from Jews of <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> origin. <PERSON> Elazar </PERSON> noted small parties have goals other than winning votes. `` Most of them just want to get on TV so they can talk about an idea they think is important,'' he said. `` That's the way <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> democracy is structured,'' he added. `` In this country, there's the possibility of giving a voice to almost anything.''

 Four people, including former <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Packers </ORGANIZATION> halfback <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, were arrested Wednesday in a protest at the Capitol against the plight of the homeless, police said. The four were charged with unlawful entry after staging a sit-in at the reception area of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>'s office, said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>. The maximum penalty for the charge is a $ 500 fine and six months in prison.

<HEAD>NATO Defense Ministers Meet On Upgrading Short-range Missiles</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> must maintain short-range nuclear weapons now that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have agreed to ban intermediate-range missiles, a new report says. The study will be the focus of a meeting beginning today of defense ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, officials said. Most <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations want to increase the range of the tactical weapons to make up for the loss of intermediate-range arms. The defense chiefs will be asked to endorse the report, a detailed look at the role of short-range nuclear rockets and artillery in the Western alliance. `` The conclusion is yes, there will be a requirement for short-range nuclear forces but there's no reason ... for a decision on how to pursue that goal ... now,'' a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said on condition of anonymity. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed the treaty in December to eliminate all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet land-based missiles with ranges from about 300 miles to 3,400 miles. Since the agreement, the question of upgrading short-range nuclear forces _ artillery and missiles with ranges up to about 300 miles _ has received more attention. `` The overall aim is the maintenance and enhancement of an effective deterrence,'' said <PERSON> Frits </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolkestein </PERSON>, the Dutch defense minister. He said the range of short-range, or tactical weapons, should be extended and `` made more flexible and less vulnerable.'' `` If systems can be made more effective and more survivable, the number of warheads may consequently be reduced,'' he said. The ministers were expected to make no decisions on the controversial issue of modernizing short-range weapons. Even so, the discussions probably will shape the debate leading to a decision on whether to give <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> more powerful nuclear weapons for the front lines. Analysts say ranges eventually may be extended up to the treaty limits of about 300 miles. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> have indicated support for modernizing short-range weapons. But <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, with strong anti-nuclear groups, say <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> has no pressing need now for such a decision. The most controversial of the weapons under discussion for modernization is the Lance surface-to-surface missile, which was introduced in 1972 and which military analysts say will be obsolete by 1995. The Lance has a range of a little more than 60 miles, and a new system might boost that up to more 250 miles. Also under discussion is a new tactical air-to-surface missile, called a stand-off weapon, which would replace nuclear gravity bombs. It would allow fighters to launch weapons to a target without flying over heavy fighting. The short-range arsenal also includes nuclear artillery shells for 155 mm and 203 mm howitzers, which have ranges up to 18 miles. Work on upgrading these arms is under way. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Defense Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> will attend the talks, held twice a year on nuclear issues. Fourteen of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s 16 members will take part, with <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> attending as an observer. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> is not part of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s joint military structure.

<HEAD>A Revival of `Cafe Crown' Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>

 The Cafe Royal was a legendary <LOCATION> Lower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> restaurant where the stars and patrons of the nearby Yiddish theaters gathered to snack and schmooze before and after performances. The famous Second Avenue watering hole is gone now, but its spirit permeates <PERSON> Hy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>'s `` Cafe Crown,'' a modest, mild comedy set in a fictional recreation of the old cafe. The play, directed by <PERSON> Elia </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazan </PERSON>, first had a three-month Broadway run during the 1941-42 season. Nearly a half century later, `` Cafe Crown'' has returned in a lavish, loving production at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION>'s Public Theater The director this time around is <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Charnin </PERSON>, the man behind the musical, ` <PERSON> Annie </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Charnin </PERSON> has done all he can to resuscitate the old play, and for much of its three acts, he succeeds. First of all, <PERSON> Charnin </PERSON> and designer <PERSON> Santo </PERSON> <PERSON> Loquasto </PERSON> have created an evocative setting, a beautiful <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> World </LOCATION> restaurant done in dark wood and emerald green walls. An elaborate bar hugs one side of the stage with a cluster of tables scattered down front. There's even a spiffy revolving front door that hurdles customers in and out of the cafe. Second, he has a bravura leading man. <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> stars as impresario and actor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, a role modeled after the famous Yiddish performer <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Adler </PERSON>. `` I do n't believe in restraint,'' bellows Cole, and neither does <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>. The character may be Jewish, but <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> is all glorious ham. The thin plot turns on <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>'s decision to return to the theater as the director of a new family drama he has written. `` It's a simple tragedy,'' he explains. `` The story of parents and children.'' If the story sounds a little bit like `` King <PERSON> Lear </PERSON>,'' what's the difference? The audience will adore it, <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> proclaims. Thirdly, `` Cafe Crown'' contains an astonishing array of veteran character actors _ those hard-working, seldom celebrated performers who shine, even in supporting roles. Eighteen actors play 21 roles in the play, and there's not a dud among them. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> dominates the evening but he gets strong support from this cavalcade of performers. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s real-life wife, plays his estranged spouse in `` Cafe Crown.'' In a beautifully underplayed performance, Miss <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> lets <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> get the laughs. She gets the sympathy. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dishy </PERSON> is the essence of exasperation as a harried cafe employee, but the master of the putdown is <PERSON> Fyvush </PERSON> <PERSON> Finkel </PERSON> as an unflappable waiter who turns badgering the customers into a laugh-getting art form. There is more hilarious funny business from <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goz </PERSON> as a prolific Yiddish playwright, now working on play number 153, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> as a newspaper drama critic who writes his reviews before he sees the plays and <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> as his whining wife who also fancies herself an actress. Although this affectionate revival confirms that `` Cafe Crown'' is not a lost masterpiece, it does demonstrates that with a marvelous cast, astute direction and a wonderful setting, an enjoyable evening can be spun from the lightest of material.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has decided to withdraw from its `` front-line'' <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> position one of two huge rented barges used to support Special Operations Forces in the waterway, administration officials say. The barge, which had been stationed in the northern gulf near an Iranian stronghold on <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, is gradually being withdrawn to an anchorage off <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, said the officials, who spoke Wednesday on condition they not be named. The barge will remain `` operational'' for the time being, in part to reassure <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> allies in the region the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is not withdrawing its forces precipitously, the sources said. But the withdrawal is just one more indication the Pentagon is prepared to reduce its naval presence if the cease-fire between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> holds. `` This is n't the start of the drawdown, because we have n't removed any of our warships yet,'' said one official `` But it's a step in that direction.'' The barges, rented and deployed in 1987 after the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration agreed to protect Kuwaiti-owned tankers inside the gulf, were cloaked in secrecy for months. It was only in late July that <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials authorized reporters in the region to visit one of them for the first time. The floating combat bases were put together when <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states surrounding the gulf rejected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pleas to use their territory for the special forces. Equipped with communications gear and a variety of weapons, the barge bases were home for <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> SEAL commandos who manned patrol boats and Army Special Operations Forces helicopters. The barges, code-named Hercules and Winbrown 7, have been cramped homes for about 200 soldiers, sailors and Marines. Gen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crist </PERSON>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said in a recent interview that the barges were instrumental in discouraging Iranian shipping raids in the northern gulf for seven months before the cease-fire. Their secret, night-flying Army helicopters also caught an Iranian minelayer, proving that <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> was mining gulf sea lanes, the general noted. <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> added that the barges, an idea borrowed from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> where American forces patrolled in enemy-held areas, showed it was possible to range far afield `` without a tremendous base infrastructure ... and still project our power.''

 Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has renewed his attacks against <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> counterpart <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, but he still stops barely short of declaring him unqualified. On the `` CBS Evening News'' on Wednesday night, anchorman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> put it directly to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. `` Do you, or do you not, believe that Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is qualified to be president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he asked. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the courteous <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator that he is, refused to give a yes or no answer. `` He is not nearly as qualified as a lot of other heavyweights in the Republican party,'' he said. `` I think everyone in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was shocked and surprised when he was chosen.'' Earlier Wednesday, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> blasted <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> at a rally in <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has a proven record of failure in the war against drugs,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` And now he wants to turn that job over to <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Now you just tell me any qualifications he has in that regard. If <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is serious about the war on drugs, then why would he choose <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to lead it?'' He compared himself with his junior <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> colleague from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. `` My friends, there's an important difference here,'' he told the crowd at the plaza outside the <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, city hall. `` I think millions of Americans would agree that <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is not qualified to step in if he had to and be president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> went on to ridicule the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> campaign for saying <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> would head the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space program. `` I see where <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also wants to play a major role in National Security,'' he said. `` Does n't that shake you up a bit. That's a frightening thought. Are you ready for that?'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> talked of how <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attended 17 national security meetings and did not speak up against selling arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in exchange for hostages. `` But you know, when I think about -LRB- that -RRB- and I think about <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, I believe I'd rather have <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> there not saying anything ... than having <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> active at the national security meeting,'' he said. The Democratic campaign says <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> remains a problem for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and one that would make a difference if the polls tighten up. `` We need to keep that issue in front of the voters,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s press secretary. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> planned to continue stumping in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> today for that state's 47 electoral votes, more than any other. A <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll released this week put the Democratic ticket 11 points behind, but campaign officials said they believed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' new advertising campaign was already cutting that margin. On <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s schedule today was a foreign policy address to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> does n't usually promote crop failures, but it's making one exception this year. When farmers go into their local <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> offices these days to apply for drought relief or see about the 1989 wheat program, they'll probably see posters warning about the hazards of growing marijuana The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> says its anti-drug message will be carried into every corner of the nation by the department's sprawling agencies. `` One day or one week will not solve the problem of illegal drug use,'' Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` But participation in this day and in the week's activities can help mobilize the efforts of concerned citizens _ in government and out _ to solve this distressing problem that faces <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> recently proclaimed the week of Oct. 24-30 as <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug-Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Week </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, daily programs of entertainment and brief speeches are making the rounds of various government departments. `` We should note that this effort is bipartisan,'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said. `` Others, like us, are meeting today, or on another day this week, all across the nation. They are assembling in town meetings, in conferences, at rallies, in schools.'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> paid tribute to a number of <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agencies for anti-drug activities, including the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which he said last year `` eradicated more than 250,000 high-potency marijuana plants grown illegally on national forests, plants that had a street value of nearly $ 1 billion.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> arrested 135 suspects associated with the illegal pot harvest and charged them with felonies, he said. Another agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is displaying anti-marijuana posters in its 3,000 county offices, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> ASCS </ORGANIZATION> handles commodity programs, payments and emergency drought relief for participating farmers. The agency also is using newsletters in its program aimed at illegal marijuana cultivation. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said the department's <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which administers school lunch and food stamp programs, is working with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to support a `` Just Say No'' message among school children. The agency also is working with the association to conduct a poster and essay contest with a drug prevention theme among elementary and secondary schools. Also, he said, the food agency `` encouraged the dairy industry to display ` Just Say No' on the side panels of milk cartons used in the School Lunch Program, a potential for reaching 26 million children in more than 90,000 schools.'' The department <ORGANIZATION> Extension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, through volunteer adult and teenage 4-H leaders, has established alcohol and drug abuse programs in more than 30 states, <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> scientists say they have found a way to make oranges and grapefruits shed their peels quickly and easily, with only a little tug here and there. The quick strip job is accomplished by giving the fruit a dose of an enzyme, pectinase, which dissolves the albedo, or the white, fleshy tissue that glues the peel to the fruit. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a chemist in the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the process leaves the fruit's core `` much cleaner than if you peeled it yourself.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the technique, called vacuum infusion, may reduce current losses _ as high as 40 percent _ of fruit and juice from hand peeling and sectioning.

 _ <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Some part-time tobacco graders employed by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will get pay raises of up to 20 percent beginning Nov. 6. Assistant Secretary <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilles </PERSON> said Wednesday that the tobacco graders in the GS-5 and GS-7 government pay scales will be raised 20 percent, while those at then GS-9 level will receive a 13 percent increase. The workers, whose jobs are seasonal, now get about $ 290 a week at the GS-5 level, $ 360 a week at GS-7, and $ 440 a week at GS-9. <PERSON> Gilles </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> asked the Office of Personnel Management on Aug. 25 for a 20 percent increase across the board, but received approval for only the three lower pay scales. Raises for graders at the higher levels of GS-11 and GS-12 were denied. They currently receive about $ 533 and $ 638 per week, respectively. `` This pay increase will make it easier for <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> to recruit and maintain its quality tobacco grading work force,'' <PERSON> Gilles </PERSON> said. About 260 tobacco graders work for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. An agency spokesman, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>, said their salaries are paid from user fees and not taxpayer funds. Federal employees are scheduled for a 4.1 percent pay increase on Jan. 1, 1989, and all tobacco graders _ including the ones receiving Nov. 6 increases _ will share in that one, the agency said.

<TEXT>
 For lovers of classical singing, the news at the Metropolitan Opera's first `` The Barber of <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION>'' this season is that <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Battle </PERSON> was in her usual radiant voice and the rest of the cast was right up there with her. For musicologists, the news is that the remarkable third-act aria which <PERSON> Rossini </PERSON> wrote for tenor <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, who sang <LOCATION> Almaviva </LOCATION> at the 1816 premiere, was sung Wednesday night by American tenor <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rossini </PERSON> took the aria out in 1817 when the tenor engaged could n't sing it. The Met had not included it for 25 years, and possibly never had. <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>, who has the flexibility to sing pleasingly what really is coloratura for a man, is used to singing the aria in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In a letter to critics last week, he expressed dismay that the Met had cut 20 measures of it. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nucci </PERSON> sang the barber, <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON>. He establishes his brash, loud, wheeler-dealer character in his first entrance, coming on like a snake-oil salesman. With that planted in listeners' minds, <PERSON> Nucci </PERSON> tones down to become a fine singer and team player in an operatic farce. <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> <PERSON> Enzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Dara </PERSON> was unusually funny as the guardian of <PERSON> Rosina </PERSON> -LRB- Miss Battle -RRB- who intends to marry her. He will, of course, be foiled by <LOCATION> Almaviva </LOCATION>, whose disguises as a soldier and a music teacher, cooked up by <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON>, get him close to <PERSON> Rosina </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dara </PERSON>'s comic timing and his singing are superb. To add humor, he uses several different walks, including a fast, self-satisfied shuffle, after he locks <PERSON> Rosina </PERSON> in the house. Miss Battle's voice is what a listener would dream it should be: accurate, full of delicate warmth, floating with infinite grace. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Essex </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, made his Met debut as the `` real'' music teacher. He has a ripe bass and is commanding; it was a delight to watch <PERSON> Dara </PERSON> respond to his stage business. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Wray </PERSON> has a small, often ignored scene as the housekeeper which she sang so well as to be noticed. <PERSON> Ralf </PERSON> <PERSON> Weikert </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, who made his Met debut last season with another bel canto opera, `` The Elixir of Love,'' conducted with sensitivity. The Met last had presented `` The Barber'' in its 1984-85 season.

<HEAD>Jury Finds Iranian Guilty of Arms Smuggling Plot</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An Iranian father and son convicted of a plot to smuggle high-tech missile parts from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were part of a world-wide effort by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to obtain <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons during the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war, an official says. <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Modarressi </PERSON>, 64, and his son, <PERSON> Majid </PERSON>, 30, each face up to 15 years in prison and $ 1.25 million in fines for their attempt to send microwave tubes for the Hawk anti-aircraft missile system to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. The father pleaded guilty last week, and the son was found guilty Wednesday after a four-week jury trial in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Iranians have made a concerted effort all over the world to buy <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> weapons and parts, and we have made a concerted effort to stop them,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kittridge </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is a case in which we have prevailed.'' The trial stemmed from a 10-month investigation in which a Customs agent posed as an employee of the Massachusetts-based <ORGANIZATION> Raytheon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, maker of the Hawk missile. The undercover agent, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Crogan </PERSON>, recorded conversations with the Modarressis in which they offered to pay him $ 280,000 if he would steal the microwave tubes from <ORGANIZATION> Raytheon </ORGANIZATION>. They told Crogan they planned to disguise the tubes as well-drilling equipment and ship them to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> via a third country such as <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. Expert witnesses testified that the tubes are a critical component of the radar system that allows the Hawk to blast jet aircraft out of the sky. They said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> bought the missiles from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the 1970s, while the <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> was still in power, but has run short of parts since the Islamic Revolution in 1979 and the beginning of the Iran-Iraq war a year later. The two sides reached a cease-fire in August. The Modarressis were arrested Jan. 15 in a <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION> freight yard where they had come to inspect the tubes. The father and son went on trial together Sept. 28. But as testimony neared a close last week, the elder <PERSON> Modarressi </PERSON> unexpectedly changed his plea to guilty, leaving the jury to decide only the case of the son. The younger <PERSON> Modarressi </PERSON> is a resident alien who has lived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> 12 years and has an American wife and 4-year-old daughter in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. During the trial, his father was described as an international merchant with homes in <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> who previously had traded in shoes and pecans. Judge <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wold </PERSON> scheduled sentencing for both men Nov. 7 and released the son until then. The father is being held at the <ORGANIZATION> Salem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION>.

 A court ordered two Swiss television journalists to pay fines of $ 65 each for killing a fish during a re-creation of a chemical accident two years ago that seriously polluted the <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION> river. A <LOCATION> Basel </LOCATION> court ruled Wednesday that the journalists violated animal protection laws when they put a fish in a container of water they said was polluted in the same way the Rhine had been after the accident, and filmed the fish in its death throes. The filming took place three months after the Nov. 1, 1986 accident at the chemical plant in <LOCATION> Schweizerhalle </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Basel </LOCATION>, a statement from Swiss television said. The sequence was never broadcast. The statement, issued after the ruling, said the sequence was intended to give viewers a `` visual warning'' about the damage caused by such accidents.

<HEAD>Iraq's U.N. Ambassador Says Shatt Waterway Could Be Replaced With
New Port</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If the Iran-Iraq peace talks break down over the disputed Shatt-al-Arab waterway, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> will re-open a deepwater port west of the waterway, its <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador says. The ambassador, <PERSON> Ismat </PERSON> <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON>, predicted resolution of the issue and also was optimistic about an exchange of tens of thousands of prisoners of war held by each side, saying, `` That is the brightest part of the picture.'' The Iran-Iraq peace talks are to resume Monday in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. The two enemies agreed to a cease-fire in August, halting the war that began in 1980. <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON> said one key to the talks is that his country is seeking a pledge from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> not to resume stopping ships in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> to search for Iraq-bound war cargo. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has not searched any ships since the cease-fire began Aug. 20, but says it retains that right. <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON> made his comments Wednesday night at his home before returning to <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> for consultations. The deepwater port at <PERSON> Khor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zouber </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON>, was productive before the war began and could be restored if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> wo n't guarantee free navigation on the <PERSON> Shatt-al-Arab </PERSON> as well as agree to its being dredged. The Khor Zouber port just west of the <LOCATION> Shatt-al-Arab </LOCATION> is entered through the <PERSON> Khor </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> channel, which empties into the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The Shatt-al-Arab was <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s primary outlet to the gulf before the war, but it has been blocked by sunken ships, unexploded ordnance and an accumulation of eight years of silt. Asked if <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> wishes to develop an alternative deep-water port, <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON> replied, `` We'll have to'' if <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> wo n't agree to begin dredging and re-open the <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON>, known to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> as the <LOCATION> Arvand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Clearing the <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON> will take two years, he said, adding that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> could be called in to help the dredging. `` The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cleared the Suez Canal of ordnance two times'' after wars in 1956 and 1973 between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON> noted. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> insists the 1975 Algiers Treaty that defines their border as running down the middle of the Shatt be maintained. President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> rejected the treaty in 1980. Asked how long <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was willing to continue the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks, <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON> said: `` We are ready to stay there until hell freezes over or until we reach complete agreement.''

<TEXT>
 A conservation group today listed its choices for the 10 most threatened national wildlife refuges and said that without corrective action soon, `` some of them may die.'' The Wilderness Society, in a report, recommended the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> find ways to better protect water quality on refuge lands and give refuge managers more control. The <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, in response, said the problems cited by the conservation group `` are not new, nor are they being ignored.'' The service manages 445 refuges. In no particular order, here are the 10 most endangered refuges as listed by the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. _ <LOCATION> Kesterson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Described as `` in a coma'' because of selenium poisoning from irrigation runoff that has killed thousands of ducks and other waterfowl. _ National Key Deer, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> As many as 20 percent of the deer in this western <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Keys refuge are killed by cars each year. _ <LOCATION> Loxahatchee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Nearby development has drastically changed water flow patterns in this <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> region, bringing periods of both excessive and insufficient flow. The water is contaminated by heavy fertilizer use. _ <LOCATION> Stillwater </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> It has become a chemical `` dumping ground'' for the <LOCATION> Newlands </LOCATION> irrigation project. Mercury in fish has been found at up to four times the amount permitted for human consumption. _ <LOCATION> Chincoteague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> A growing visitor population has put pressure on wildlife nesting. _ <LOCATION> Yazoo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> Agricultural runoff is carrying high concentrations of pesticides into the refuge. _ Arctic, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Oil companies and the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> want to explore for oil near the coast of the <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has not permitted. _ Lower <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Nearby pesticide spraying and runoff, wastewater discharges and planned real estate development are the major threats. _ <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Soil erosion is damaging habitat and reproduction. Wastewater and pesticide-loaded agricultural runoff is polluting refuge waters and heavy recreation use is hurting habitat. _ Great Swamp, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Population growth 26 miles west of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> is straining two sewage treatment plants whose outflow eventually reaches the refuge. Road salt, fertilizer and pesticides are reaching the refuge. Old toxic dumps threaten contamination of the water. Water flow is increasingly variable. The society identified these other wildlife refuges that it said had less severe, but still serious, problems: <PERSON> Fallon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Bowdoin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Hakalau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Souris </LOCATION> and <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Salyer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Ouray </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Kenai </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tule </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has spared <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s only female death-row inmate, ruling she was not directly to blame for the death of her goddaughter, whose last months were spent in torture chained to a bathtub. <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, 42, of <PERSON> Paterson </PERSON> had been on death row since November 1984, when she was convicted of first-degree murder for the death of <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Feury </PERSON>, an orphan who came to live with Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. The girl died at age 13 in January 1983 of head injuries suffered when she hit her head on the bathtub to which she was chained every night. The girl's mummified body was found the following December in an attic crawl space in Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s house. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> vacated Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s death sentence Wednesday and ordered a new trial on the murder charge. It did not disturb her <ORGANIZATION> Passaic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> convictions for kidnapping, attempted murder, terroristic threats and aggravated assault for which she is serving 87 -LCB- years without eligibility for parole. The ruling was the first time the court found the death penalty was improperly applied. Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> was the sole woman on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s death row `` We're pleased with the decision,'' said <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenman </PERSON>, an attorney who represented Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. <PERSON> Greenman </PERSON> applauded the court's finding that the lower court erred in failing to have jurors consider the lesser charges of manslaughter or aggravated manslaughter. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Passaic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor at the time and now a <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge in <LOCATION> Essex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, declined to comment. Passaic County Prosecutor <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Fava </PERSON> also declined to comment, saying he had not had time to digest the opinion. In an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in 1985, Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, a former hairdresser and telephone operator, said she had become a fundamentalist Christian while in prison. The court ruled that `` if the medical evidence established that <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Feury </PERSON>'s death was caused by starvation or her weakened medical condition, or by asphyxiation resulting from her being wrapped and stuffed in a crawl space while alive, we would agree with the state that a jury could find that <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> by her own conduct caused <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON>'s death.'' `` The medical evidence presented in this record, however, does not support that finding. According to the medical examiner, the victim died as a result of blows to the head and face caused by striking the tub,'' the court said. `` <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> did not deal the victim those fatal blows.'' Court records show the girl fell against the tub after being lifted by <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, a boy who began living with the family in the fall of 1981 when he was 14. <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> became Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s enforcer and lover, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> account. <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> served two years in a juvenile facility after a plea bargain for his role in the girl's death, <PERSON> Greenman </PERSON> said. The youth completed his sentence and was freed. According to testimony at Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s trial, <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> was starved, forced to wear disposable diapers and hanged from her thumbs. Court records said the boy also was a victim of Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s attacks Prosecutors said she met him and other victims through friendships they had developed with her own daughter, who also lived with the family. During the trial, the defense introduced testimony from a psychiatrist that Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> suffered from psychological problems that diminished her capacity to control herself. She told the victims their punishments were ordered by a violent male she named `` <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Joel </PERSON>.'' Authorities said Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s daughter was not a victim of abuse.

 The arrival of the nuclear-powered carrier <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nimitz </ORGANIZATION> and eight support ships in the Arabian Sea this weekend will not change the number of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> region, officials say.

Both groups are part of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>. The change will leave the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with 26 ships, one fewer than on Aug. 20 when a cease-fire took effect in the 8-year war between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Wednesday. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contingent is by far the largest of seven foreign naval units in the region. About 16 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships, including six mine sweepers, are in the gulf at any given time. The impending switch in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carrier battle groups returns one of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s powerful Aegis-type missile cruisers to the area for the first time since the USS Vincennes left. Officials said the USS <ORGANIZATION> Antietam </ORGANIZATION>, one of the newest of the high-tech, billion-dollar warships, is making its first trip to the region as a Nimitz escort. Other ships in the battle group are the nuclear cruiser <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, missile destroyers <PERSON> Waddell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoddert </PERSON>, frigate <PERSON> Barbey </PERSON>, ammunition ship <LOCATION> Kiska </LOCATION>, supply ship Mars and the oiler <LOCATION> Willamette </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials say the American force in the gulf will be scaled back to five or six ships if the truce continues to hold. That was the size of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Force </LOCATION> when the war escalated in mid-1987 and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> began escorting Kuwaiti-owned tankers that had been given <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> registry and flew the American flag. The officials have not disclosed a timetable, but military sources say some reductions probably will come through attrition or changing the orders of ships marked for gulf duty. Military sources say a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carrier force probably will continue to operate in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> for about half the time, as it did before the gulf crisis. In the only force cutback to date, the Aegis-type cruiser Mobile Bay had its orders for the gulf canceled Aug. 12, the day before it was to leave for the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> to replace its sister ship, the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>. The Vincennes' departure in early September reduced the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strength to 26 ships. Although fleet strength has not been reduced further, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has curtailed air surveillance activities and ended the close escorting of U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers through the gulf. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships now monitor the tankers' movements, ready to respond in case of trouble. No armed incidents have been reported in the gulf since the truce, military and shipping officials say. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> also have announced they no longer will accompany commercial ships in convoy.

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, after challenging <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in states often ignored in presidential politics, is plunging back into the hotly contested battle in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, warning that the Democrats' definition of prosperity means high interest rates. `` We do n't need that kind of Democratic prosperity,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Wednesday, noting that the prime interest rate reached 21.5 percent under the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration, more than twice what it is now. `` We need the kind that <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has brought to this country,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared. After stops Wednesday in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, and Billings, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flew here for an endorsement today by a maritime union and a rally. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is considered a tossup state. Then, he was heading for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> where 47 electoral votes, the largest prize in the nation, are at stake. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will spend two days in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> before heading back east. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, said that in the 12 days remaining before the election, `` We're going to focus on states where we think the support is soft, where the margin is close. `` We're pleased and encouraged by the polls but we are going to continue to work to make sure we've locked up the necessary electoral votes,'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made a point Wednesday of claiming that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, his Democratic opponent, would put in jeopardy the income tax cuts enacted during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. He said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> called the tax cuts `` one of the worst bills that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ever could have passed.'' `` Well, do n't elect him cause he might just take that cut away from the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people and I will not do that,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a cheering crowd of perhaps 2,000 people in a gymnasium at <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in Billings. A determined <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporter, a young woman who gave her name as <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, dashed back and forth through the audience with a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sign until it was snatched away by someone in the crowd. She tussled with her antagonist, and both were led away by a policeman. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is waging a determined battle to win the 20 electoral votes in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, where he spent Wednesday morning, he had conceded <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> during the primary session to then-rival <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. Taken together, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> offer only seven of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. Wednesday's visit was his only stop in each state in the general election campaign. Asked as he left Billings why he even bothered to stop there, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied, `` There's a lot at stake here. You've got two congressional seats, you've got a governor's seat, you've got a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat, you've got the president and the vice president. `` So it is very, very important and it shows that we are taking absolutely nothing for granted,'' the vice president told reporters. Recalling the words he had said inside the gym, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I am running like I am behind, and I mean it. And we are not going to lighten up at all.'' In Billings, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Two taxied to the runway for the flight to <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> but then turned back when the galley crew reported gas fumes in the rear of the plane. Fire fighting crews were sent to the plane and the engines were turned off while an inspection was made. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other members of his entourage remained on board. After about 20 minutes, it was determined that strong cross winds had blown fuel fumes into the aircraft and they would dissipate on takeoff, as they did when the plane departed. Some time after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> left, the press plane chartered by media covering the vice president was held on the ground for a couple hours because of high winds that prevented takeoff, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> officials said. It aborted three takeoffs because of a stalled engine before finally departing.

 <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON> offered a self-styled soldier of fortune $ 1 million to kill rival sex magazine publishers <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Guccione </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Annenberg </PERSON>, authorities said. The purported hitman, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> WerBell </PERSON>, died of a heart attack in December 1983 about a month after <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON> gave him the check, sheriff's Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimm </PERSON> said Wednesday night. <PERSON> WerBell </PERSON> was in his 60s when he died of natural causes, authorities said. <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON>'s alleged motive was not disclosed and no charges have been filed against him. <PERSON> Grimm </PERSON> told a news conference that information about the plot turned up recently in an investigation of the 1983 murder-for-hire slaying of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> theater producer <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Radin </PERSON>, whom authorities said was embroiled in a soured finance deal for the movie `` The <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>.'' A former <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON> bodyguard, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Mentzer </PERSON>, is one of four defendants charged in <PERSON> Radin </PERSON>'s killing. Investigators have not interviewed the Hustler magazine publisher and have not presented a case to the prosecutor, <PERSON> Grimm </PERSON> said. He declined to elaborate and said <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> Block </PERSON> spoke about the purported plot earlier in the day because he had been approached by the news media. `` Our investigation is continuing,'' <PERSON> Grimm </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Grimm </PERSON> identified targets of the alleged plot as <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> and <PERSON> Guccione </PERSON>. He declined to name a fourth person targeted, but authorities told <ORGANIZATION> KNBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> that person was <PERSON> Annenberg </PERSON>, the publishing magnate and former ambassador. `` <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON> one evening called an individual by the name of <PERSON> WerBell </PERSON> to his home and allegedly offered him $ 1 million if he would arrange for the death of these four individuals,'' said <PERSON> Block </PERSON>, adding he took the matter seriously. `` I've been led to believe that <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON> has a propensity to try to harm people he sees as his enemies, whether -LRB- over -RRB- business arrangements or whatever.'' A woman at <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON>'s office told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flynt </ORGANIZATION> `` just said he does n't make comments on trash like that.'' <PERSON> WerBell </PERSON> was an international arms dealer who developed the MAC-10 submachine gun. He called himself a retired general of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, according to promotional material from his Georgia-based counterterrorism firm, <ORGANIZATION> Sionics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, released by the sheriff's department. <PERSON> Grimm </PERSON> displayed a photocopy of a $ 1 million check allegedly signed by <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON> and made out to <PERSON> WerBell </PERSON>. Block said a Flynt associate immediately stopped payment on the check so it never was negotiated. The year of the alleged plot, <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON> claimed to have knowledge of videotapes purportedly showing <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, mistress of the late <ORGANIZATION> Diners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloomingdale </PERSON>, engaged in sexual antics with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials. The tapes were never proven to exist. At the time, <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON> was heavily sedated with drugs to assuage pain from wounds that left him paralyzed after a 1978 assassination attempt during an obscenity trial in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, said his place on the list was the price of celebrity. `` It's part of being famous in the later part of the 20th century,'' he said in a statement. `` I have no association with those who made up the list or those whose names appear on it.'' <PERSON> Guccione </PERSON>, publisher of Penthouse magazine, said he had been informed about the alleged plot by a Flynt bodyguard some time ago. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, publicist for <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>, said the entertainer had no comment.

<HEAD>High Catch Rate of Young Cod Shrinking Stock</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Researchers say fishermen using more sophisticated equipment are catching fish before they are old enough to spawn, causing the number of mature cod in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> waters to plummet. A recent study found that just 30 percent of the cod in the rich <LOCATION> Georges </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> fishing area that were alive at the beginning of 1987 survived to the beginning of 1988. The high mortality rate poses a threat to the cod population and the $ 40 million-a-year <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> industry it supports. Also, studies found that the spawning stock of <ORGANIZATION> Georges </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> cod declined for the fifth consecutive year in 1988 to 68.1 million pounds, the lowest in the 11 years that stock size has been calculated. `` It's clear that the fishing effort is at record high levels,'' said <PERSON> Fredric </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Serchuk </PERSON>, chief of off-shore fishery resources investigation for the federal <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in Woods Hole. `` The fishermen are very dependent on small young fish,'' he said. `` As a result, when there has been successful spawning, the fish do n't remain in the population long enough to contribute to the spawning stock.'' The number of fishing vessels, days spent at sea and fishing trip duration is increasing, <PERSON> Serchuk </PERSON> said. Fishermen also have become more efficient by using more sophisticated fish-finding equipment. The fisheries center estimates that the 1988 commercial catch of <ORGANIZATION> Georges </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> cod will be about 52.5 million pounds, about 25 percent higher than in 1987. The increased 1988 catch is due to record-high fishing levels by the region's 1,600 fishermen who fish for cod and other bottom fish, and an above-average number of cod hatched in 1985. But with a high mortality rate, the 1985 generation is being depleted quickly. For 1989, <PERSON> Serchuk </PERSON> forecast a low supply of cod because the number of fish hatched in 1986 that would be catchable next year appears low. According to the fisheries center, the survival rate for <ORGANIZATION> Georges </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> cod has fallen from about 65 percent in 1978 to 30 percent last year. Another problem has been a 1984 World Court decision that created a territorial boundary line in <LOCATION> Georges </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> about halfway between <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION>, barring American fishermen from prime waters now belonging to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The boundary means the same number of fishermen are restricted to a smaller area. Cod is the predominant species landed in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, generally accounting for more catch by weight than other bottom fish such as haddock and yellow-tailed flounder.

 A judge's decision has forced Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> to fight an uphill battle for re-election while under a perjury indictment. But he has said he has n't lost any moral high ground to his opponent, former actor <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. In one of the nation's bitterest campaigns, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, R-Ga., has repeatedly brought up his Democratic rival's admitted alcoholism and past brushes with the law <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who played `` Cooter'' on television's `` The Dukes of Hazzard,'' has proposed in turn that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> be tested for drug use and psychiatric problems. The battle returned to the limelight Wednesday when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vining </PERSON> halted the two-term congressman's trial on 10 perjury counts until after the Nov. 8 election. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s high-speed strategy of representing himself as his own attorney amid the campaign backfired when <PERSON> Vining </PERSON> brought into court two recent campaign mailings, one of which mentioned <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s claim that a private polygraph test supports his defense <PERSON> Vining </PERSON>, who disallowed a polygraph test as evidence in the trial, said the literature might influence jurors. He also said he wanted the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to investigate whether <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> violated court rules governing comments lawyers may make outside the courtroom. The judge then dismissed the jury and later rejected <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s last attempt at a quick trial, a request that <PERSON> Vining </PERSON> hear the case without a jury Prosecutor <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillen </PERSON> also was willing to allow <PERSON> Vining </PERSON> to render the verdict, but federal court rules also require the judge's consent. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, who had demanded his own indictment from the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, said he `` very much would have liked to have had an exoneration before the election.'' `` However, I knew that with a campaign with only two weeks to go, and with the issue of perjury uppermost in many people's minds, that it was important for me to get that polygraph evidence out to the voters of the 4th District, because it totally exonerates me,'' he said. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> is accused of lying to a grand jury when he said he did not remember being told that an $ 850,000 home mortgage loan he was seeking might be coming from illegal drug proceeds. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> negotiated the loan with a money broker who turned out to be an undercover federal agent, and the prosecution has a recording of the agent telling <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> he had a `` gut feeling'' drugs were involved. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> would not comment on the case. `` We had an 18-point lead before the indictment, and we got it not because of his problems, but because of our hard work,'' he said. A poll by The <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal-Constitution </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s Oct. 17 indictment found the challenger leading 53-27 percent. `` We're going to run the last two weeks of this campaign just as we had planned to _ not talking about <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> at all,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` We're going to be talking about <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and taking the high road.'' Nonetheless, the campaign has featured <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s repeated questions about <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' own legal problems and his admitted bout with alcoholism. During his drinking days, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> acknowledged, he was arrested on several occasions for what he called `` stupid alcoholic behavior,'' referring to old disorderly conduct charges. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> also called for new debates Wednesday and said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> recently had avoided them, adding, `` if I held positions that are so clearly liberal, I would n't want to face the voters'' either. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> denied ducking <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>. He said he has debated the congressman eight times and claimed <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> declined seven invitations to attend forums with <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. But he said his schedule for the remainder of the campaign is already set and will not include debates. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> said he will ask voters to support him with the understanding he would resign if convicted. That approach, he said, would ensure that a new Republican candidate could enter the subsequent special election. `` I believe they will re-elect me with the understanding that an exoneration after the election is just as good as an exoneration before the election,'' he said.

<HEAD>Family Planners Claim Success in Holding Down Population Growth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Chinese family planners today claimed a slackening of the population explosion in the first half of this year, but said keeping the growth rate at manageable levels will not be easy. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Honggui </PERSON>, a senior official in the <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, also disclosed at a news conference that there were 10.39 million abortions, 46 for every 100 live births, in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> last year. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> denies it forces women to undergo abortions, although local officials are said to exert heavy pressure on women with unplanned pregnancies to abort. According to a nationwide survey of 500,000 households, there were 8.84 births and 3.39 deaths per thousand people in the first six months of 1988, for a natural increase of 5.45 per thousand. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> and other members of the survey team said that compared to 10.04 births in the first half of 1987 and 23.26 births for that entire year. `` Offices at various levels strengthened their work at the grassroots level,'' <PERSON> Liang </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimin </PERSON>, deputy chief of the survey team said in explaining the decrease. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> stressed that the survey, conducted by 20,000 people, was accurate. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> reported last week that there has been serious underreporting of births from many rural areas because family planning officials file false reports to meet unrealistic birth targets. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said the target of keeping <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s population, 1.08 billion at the end of 1987, down to 1.2 billion in the year 2000 will not be met if there is any letup in population control policies. Chinese population experts have said the country could have up to 1.28 billion people at the turn of the century if a recent population boom continues. The nationwide growth rate climbed from 11 per thousand in 1985 to 16.16 in 1987 as a baby boom generation of the early 1960s reached child-bearing age. The faster growth rate is a result of a relaxation of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s one-child-per-family policy Although most couples in cities are allowed only one child, couples in rural areas are generally allowed two, particularly if the first child is a girl. Rural families want boys to help work the land and carry on the family name, and many newly affluent peasants are willing to pay large fines for exceeding birth quotas until they produce a boy. <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Pei </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said families that produce unplanned babies are usually fined 10 to 15 percent of their annual incomes, with the money going to welfare facilities. He said some families have been fined up to $ 540, more than four times the average per capita annual income in the countryside.

 More than 100 people were feared drowned after an overcrowded ferry sank at a river junction in southern <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, police said today. Fifteen bodies were recovered and 94 people were reported missing in the sinking Wednesday night where the Ilisha and <PERSON> Tetulia </PERSON> rivers meet and join the <LOCATION> Meghna </LOCATION>, police and a district administrator said. Another ferry was attacked by river pirates near <LOCATION> Chandpur </LOCATION> late Tuesday, police said. Six passengers, including a pregnant woman, were thrown overboard and have not been found, <LOCATION> Chandpur </LOCATION> police said. About 200 passengers were wounded when the pirates fired rifles and hurled homemade bombs before making off with about $ 83,000 in local currency, police said. The ferry that sank was carrying more than double its authorized capacity of 100 passengers, police said. They said about 100 people on the ferry's roof swam to safety but most of those in the hull were unable to save themselves. The ferry was traveling from <LOCATION> Mehendiganj </LOCATION> to the island town of <LOCATION> Bhola </LOCATION>, about 68 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, when it sank in 22 feet of water. Police said six bodies were found in the hull of the ferry, the M.L. <PERSON> Sonali </PERSON>, and nine others were found more than a mile downstream. Two independent newspapers in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ittefaq </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sangbad </ORGANIZATION>, quoted survivors as saying the ferry went out of control while trying to negotiate a turn. The pirate attack on the second ferry, the M.V. Sagar, also occurred on the <LOCATION> Meghna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The Sagar was en route from <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Barisal </LOCATION> when about 50 pirates launched their attack near <LOCATION> Chandpur </LOCATION>, 34 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>. The pirates, who had boarded the ferry as passengers, opened fire and exploded bombs shortly before midnight Tuesday as people were bedding down for the night, <LOCATION> Chandpur </LOCATION> police said. The attackers escaped in waiting boats, the police added. They said 44 of the injured passengers were hospitalized, including four in critical condition.

 A man revealed to his 9-year-old daughter that a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> couple claims she is their child and was mixed up at birth with another infant, but he insisted he will not allow tests to prove it. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mays </PERSON>, a 43-year-old roofing supply salesman, identified himself for the first time Wednesday as the father of the girl, <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Mays </PERSON>. He said he decided to step forward for fear that she would be told by someone else who might frighten her. `` It took me a long time to realize the seriousness of this situation,'' he said. `` At first, I thought it was at terrible joke.'' <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Langhorne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, claim the girl was born to them but was swapped with another child soon after birth in 1978 at a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> hospital. The girl they raised as a daughter died in August of a heart defect. During a news conference at his attorney's office, <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> said he told his daughter a week ago of the Twiggs' months-long battle to require her to submit to genetic blood tests to prove her parentage. `` It was the most difficult thing I ever had to do in my life,'' he said. `` For a moment there was panic in her eyes. She said, ` Daddy, I do n't want to move away.''' `` Does it mean I'm not your little girl?'' she asked. <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> said he reassured the blond fourth-grader that he was her father and nothing would change, then she settled down. `` It was the only time during our hour talk she stopped me. It was all that was important to her. She wanted to make sure everything was still in place, then -LRB- she asked -RRB- could she go ride her bike,'' <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Twiggs </PERSON> have presented no evidence to show <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> could be their daughter. And even if genetic tests supported their claim, <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> said he would not surrender her. `` I would fight to the ends of the earth for her,'' he said. `` I would n't care if they traced her heritage to <ORGANIZATION> Cabbage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, she is my daughter.'' An attorney for the Twiggs, <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> was `` irresponsible'' for coming forward. `` The Twiggs were terribly distressed and amazed that he would do a thing like that, ... that he would call a press conference and expose a child to this kind of publicity, <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. The Twiggs have said their daughter, a healthy girl, was switched in a baby-selling scheme at <ORGANIZATION> Hardee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wauchula </LOCATION> for a sickly child. Hospital workers then altered records to hide the swap, they allege. <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> was born at the hospital in late 1978, about the same time as the daughter the Twiggs raised, <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON>. The couple said genetic tests this summer proved <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON> was not their biological daughter. The Twiggs filed a $ 100 million suit against the hospital and some of its employees and persuaded the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to investigate. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> failed to find sufficient evidence that federal law had been violated. This month, the <PERSON> Twiggs </PERSON> asked a judge in <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> to force <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> to submit to sophisticated genetic tests to determine if she has O-positive blood like theirs. But <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> said he also has O-type blood and does n't know what type <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> has. The judge has yet to rule on whether the testing should be required. <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> said he hopes his disclosure will help avoid a long legal battle that could evolve into a custody fight with the Twiggs. `` We want them to please, think about this child and not cause trauma in her life,'' he said.

 Portions are big enough for three, and what else would one expect at a restaurant called Triplets? What's remarkable is that none of the three owners knew they were triplets until age 19, when they met and became best friends, roommates, classmates and, eventually, business partners. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shafran </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Galland </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellman </PERSON> were born on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> 27 years ago, adopted at birth and raised in the area. Not even their adoptive parents knew they were triplets, said <PERSON> Galland </PERSON>. `` We were all fat kids with brown curly hair, and we knew we were adopted. We were comfortable with it,'' he said. In 1979, <PERSON> Galland </PERSON> went to <ORGANIZATION> Sullivan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, but transferred the next year. `` <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> came the next semester to <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, and my friends thought I was back,'' <PERSON> Galland </PERSON> said. One friend asked <PERSON> Shafran </PERSON> his birth date and whether he was adopted, and then told him he probably had a twin. News stories were published about the brothers, and when <PERSON> Kellman </PERSON> saw one, he realized the twins were triplets. On Sept. 18, 1980, they met. `` It was like we always knew each other. It was instant _ an incredible feeling,'' said <PERSON> Galland </PERSON>. `` We knew immediately that we wanted to spend a lot of time together.'' `` It was total excitement,'' said <PERSON> Kellman </PERSON>. `` It was electric.'' They all transferred to <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, rented an apartment, got a parrot named <PERSON> Zack </PERSON>, and turned down book offers. They earned degrees in business and international marketing. Eventually, they got jobs at <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON>'s Famous Roumanian Restaurant, a boistrous, <LOCATION> Lower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> institution known for huge portions and familial atmosphere. They learned their lessons well, and in January opened Triplets Roumanian Restaurant in the <LOCATION> Soho </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, serving similar ambiance and abundant, Eastern European food. It seats 200, and while people come in as strangers, the brothers try to make sure they do n't leave that way. Intentionally just a tad tacky, Triplets has a big awning with cartoon faces of the owners outside; inside, on three levels, there are mauve banquettes, mirrors and dozens of color photographs of diners having the time of their lives. There are T-shirts and coffee mugs, decorated with the triplets' mugs A Triplets club offers discounts and special events. On each table is a light-hearted, comic book-style version of the brothers' story Sometimes, there are comedians, belly dancers, musicians, sing-alongs. The words to such songs as `` Hava Nagila'' and `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'' are printed in the menus. `` People walk in and say, ` Who's the bar mitzvah boy?''' said <PERSON> Shafran </PERSON>. The brothers divide chores, but <PERSON> Shafran </PERSON> said: `` All of us talk about what we're looking for. We can cover each other's responsibilities Our paths cross constantly.'' And they clown around almost constantly. They tell half jokes, laughing before anyone on the outside has heard enough to get them. Sitting recently around a table in their restaurant, the brothers are distinguishable _ <PERSON> Shafran </PERSON>'s the largest, <PERSON> Kellman </PERSON> the smallest. <PERSON> Kellman </PERSON> also is reputed to be the most level-headed, <PERSON> Galland </PERSON> the most volatile. <PERSON> Shafran </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kellman </PERSON> are married; <PERSON> Galland </PERSON> is single. But there's no doubt they're triplets. They're gregarious, show signs of working out, and dress fashionably. Each had a similar upbringing with upper middle-class Jewish families. They've been studied by researchers looking at similarities and differences among separated twins and triplets. <PERSON> Galland </PERSON> said they are not interested in finding their biological parents, and wo n't discuss the subject. But they'll talk plenty about the comforts of home they offer at Triplets. Huge portions of steak, veal chops or chicken, stuffed cabbage, chopped liver, chicken soup, mashed potatoes with chicken cracklings and potato pancakes. Syrup pitchers of schmaltz -LRB- rendered chicken fat -RRB- sit on each table, along with blue siphons of seltzer. The seltzer is essential for the egg creams diners with any appetite left mix up after dessert, using the traditional <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s U-Bet chocolate syrup and milk. Why such fare when Americans are being urged to cut down on fat and salt? `` We do n't expect to see the same people every night. Let people have their whole-grain rice and their sushi five nights a week and then come here,'' said <PERSON> Galland </PERSON>. `` I ca n't tell you how many times people say, ` I have n't eaten like this since my mother was alive, or since my grandmother was alive.'''

 The dollar plunged against the Japanese yen Thursday, while share prices rose moderately on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar closed at 125.90 yen, down 0.90 yen from Wednesday's close of 126.80 yen Opening at 125.95 yen, the currency moved within a range of 125.80 yen to 126.15 yen. The dollar tumbled following a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report Wednesday that the nation's gross national product, the main economic indicator, grew at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the third quarter, after increasing at 3.4 percent in the first quarter and 3 percent in the second quarter. Dealers said the market had expected a 3 percent to 3.5 percent increase and the low growth rate pushed the dollar down. <PERSON> Takamasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamasaki </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> intervened in the market shortly after trading started to support the dollar. `` But it is unlikely that only the <ORGANIZATION> BOJ </ORGANIZATION>'s intervention helped the dollar recover,'' he said, adding that if the dollar fell to the 125-yen level again the central bank would intervene. The bank does not comment publicly on its activities. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 199.11-point winner Wednesday, gained another 102.31 points, or 0.37 percent, to finish trading at 27,722.92. `` Concern over inflation and higher interest rates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is gone now, and investors are showing strong interest in buying stocks,'' said a dealer with a major securities firm in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity.

<TEXT>
 Former <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> White House aide <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapin </PERSON>, who was imprisoned because he lied about his connection to political dirty tricks during the Watergate scandal, is serving as an unpaid staff adviser to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential campaign, a published report today said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON>, asked whether it was appropriate for a Watergate felon to be working as a campaign adviser, told the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, `` It's not as if the guy has not paid his debt to society.'' `` We feel that he ought to be allowed to participate in the process at this point,'' <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> said. A document distributed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign headquarters last month to state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> officials lists <PERSON> Chapin </PERSON> as one of four `` senior advisers'' to the scheduling and events unit of the national <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. A copy of the two-page document was obtained by the Mercury News. <PERSON> Chapin </PERSON> was found to have lied about his dealings with <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Segretti </PERSON>, a practitioner of campaign infiltration and sabotage whom <PERSON> Chapin </PERSON> hired for the 1972 <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> re-election campaign. `` His background is advance work,'' <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> told the newspaper, referring to <PERSON> Chapin </PERSON>. `` And that's been his strong suit. ... My understanding of his -LRB- Chapin's -RRB- role is that from time to time he consults on some big events on advance techniques.'' <PERSON> Chapin </PERSON>, who was President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s appointments secretary from 1969 to 1973, was convicted of two counts of perjury in April 1973 and served six months in prison for lying to a federal grand jury that was investigating the Watergate scandal.

<TEXT>
 Here is a chronology of major events in the attempts to free the trapped whales in <LOCATION> Barrow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>: Oct. 13 _ Three <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gray whales are discovered trapped in ice east of <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barrow </LOCATION>. They apparently became stuck a week before. Biologists are unable to contact an icebreaking ship to give aid. Oct. 14 _ Whales continue to swim several hundred feet offshore, using two holes in the ice to breathe. Biologists believe time is running out for the grays as temperatures drop to minus 13 degrees, threatening to shrink the whales' breathing space. Efforts fail again to contact an icebreaker. Oct. 18 _ Biologist says one whale may have pneumonia, as an <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Skycrane </ORGANIZATION> helicopter sets out to tow a 185-ton Hovercraft-type icebreaking barge 200 miles northwest to the whales. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> telephones with his support. Oct. 19 _ <ORGANIZATION> Eskimos </ORGANIZATION> cut new holes in the ice, but the barge effort is hampered by shallow water. Biologists say the whales' health appears stabilized, and that they are handling their captivity better than first believed. Oct. 20 _ Barge begins its journey but moves only six miles through sand bars, mud and shallow water. Two <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> brothers-in-law arrive with de-icers to enlarge breathing holes for the whales. Oct. 21 _ One of the whales, nicknamed `` Bone,'' disappears and is presumed dead. Rescuers try `` Plan B:'' a 5-ton concrete `` bullet'' wielded by a helicopter loaned by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. An easterly wind opens `` leads,'' or open water, through the ice within four miles of the whales. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> offers an icebreaker to help in the rescue. Oct. 22 _ Eskimos using chain saws lead the whales almost a half-mile closer to open water by carving 24 breathing holes in the ice. The Skycrane dropping its `` bullet'' punches four 15-to-20-foot holes in the ice at 75-yard intervals, but a massive pressure ridge of ice stands in the way. Oct. 24 _ Whales, apparently spooked by shallower water over a shoal, reverse course, retreating 800 yards towards shore. Scientists probe the ice ridge for a weak spot that arriving Soviet icebreakers could attack. Oct. 25 _ Two Soviet icebreakers arrive and begin work smashing through the ice ridge. The whales follow a detour cut by Eskimos using chain saws around the shoal they had refused to pass. Oct. 26 _ The Soviet ships move within a quarter-mile of the line of breathing holes. Rescuers used a gargantuan, tractor-like device propelled by pontoon augers to clear the ice cut by the ships. The whales moved into the new waterway cut by the vessels, and were seen swimming in the channel that leads to the open sea.

 When <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> made his motion before Judge <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Nowicki </PERSON>, Her Honor eyed him with great seriousness, then performed the opening strains of `` Marche Militaire Francaise.'' No, they are n't a pair of comics. They're members of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION>, a 47-member ensemble of lawyers who want to make motions in music as well as in the courtroom. `` It's a real nice break,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Nowicki </PERSON>, 40, a domestic relations judge by day, cellist by night with the 2-year-old orchestra. `` It's real nice to be with lawyers and not fighting.'' <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, the orchestra's conductor, is the only non-lawyer among the performers, who get together once a week in Ms. <PERSON> Nowicki </PERSON>'s courtroom for practice. About 30 lawyer-musicians were free of their legal duties Wednesday night when <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> brought down the baton for the orchestra's fall debut _ its ninth performance since its founding Saint-Saens' `` Marche Militaire'' was followed by <PERSON> Rossini </PERSON>'s `` Overture to The Barber of <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION>,'' Sir <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s `` Overture to Pinafore'' and a tribute to another <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> lawyer, `` Lincoln Portrait,'' by <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Copland </PERSON>. Asked to assess the performance, Ms. <PERSON> Nowicki </PERSON> _ whose only formal music training came during her years in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> public school system _ at first did n't want to have any part of what might be self-incriminating testimony. But she finally allowed, judiciously, that it was `` pretty good.'' What the orchestra lacks in musicianship, it makes up in spirit and seriousness. `` I did this only for you,'' bassoonist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Silberman </PERSON> told <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> at the end of the performance in paneled hall at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. `` I came into the <PERSON> Rossini </PERSON> cold,'' he added, explaining that he had never before played the composition. <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, who heads the Adrian -LRB- <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION> -RRB- Symphony Orchestra, said one of the pleasant challenges of working with the lawyers is the variety of ability and experience they bring to their performance. `` They take it very seriously, but it's fun for them and that's what makes it fun to conduct this orchestra,'' said <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> The lawyers' orchestra has its orgin at a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Symphony Chorus `` Messiah'' concert in which amateur singers and musicians perform with professionals. Ms. <PERSON> Nowicki </PERSON>, one of the `` Messiah'' participants, discovered she was sitting next to another cellist-lawyer. Why not get lawyers together to make music, they thought. `` Part of being a lawyer is the ability to focus in on the work they do,'' said <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>. `` I think lawyers are all performers at heart and they always rise to the occasion.'' Practice is a little nerve-wracking for the courthouse guards when the players file in for practice. Just what might be in those black cases? Everyone's seen the movies of Prohibition Era gangsters and their machine guns. `` This is <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, and walking into the courthouse with violin cases was a real problem for the guards,'' said <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>. But everything considered, the musician-lawyers do well, he said. `` It's good therapy.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> today threatened to shut down the company whose passenger ship sailed into Typhoon Ruby and sank with hundreds of people aboard. Authorities ordered the owners to explain why they should not lose their license for letting the vessel sail into a storm whose winds reached 140 mph. The latest casualty figures indicate just 197 people survived the sinking Monday of the 2,855-ton <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> in heavy seas about 300 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. The coast guard said an undetermined number of others reached a small island more than 100 miles west of where the ship sank. At least 33 bodies have been recovered, officials said. Some survivors remain in shock and were refusing to be flown from the islands where they washed ashore, <ORGANIZATION> coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> guard </ORGANIZATION> officials said today. The ship's manifest showed 431 passengers and a crew of 60. But coast guard officials said the headcount at sailing time was 379 passengers. Today, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> told reporters she had ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> to investigate <ORGANIZATION> Sulpicio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, which owned the Dona <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> and another passenger ship that sank 10 months ago with more than 3,000 casualties. The <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>'s sister ship, collided with an oil tanker last December off <LOCATION> Mindoro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Only 28 people survived. `` If it is necessary to suspend operations of <ORGANIZATION> Sulpicio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, then I would do so,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said. On Wednesday, she said investigators should determine why the <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> sailed despite the typhoon's approach. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuazon </PERSON>, administrator of the government's <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, said his organization had ordered Sulpicio `` to explain why we should not suspend them.'' Sulpicio President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> Go said he could not explain why the vessel sailed from <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> on schedule Sunday morning for <LOCATION> Tacloban </LOCATION>, 350 miles southeast, although the storm was approaching the eastern <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Go said he would have to speak first with surviving crew but added: `` During Sunday, when they left <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, the weather was clear.'' In <LOCATION> Tacloban </LOCATION>, Sulpicio station manager <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabigon </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>'s skipper was not among the confirmed survivors but that the chief mate and two other officers were reported safe on <LOCATION> Almagro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Capt. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Delgado </PERSON>, Philippine coast guard chief of staff, said the vessel was allowed to sail because no typhoon warning had been issued for the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> area at the time. But <PERSON> Nanette </PERSON> <PERSON> Lumarda </PERSON>, chief of the government weather service's tropical cyclones secton, said <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> developed into a tropical storm as early as 8 p.m. Friday about 645 miles east of <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> At 11 a.m. Sunday, one hour after the <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> sailed, the weather service issued a bulletin warning that <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> had grown into a typhoon and was moving west-northwest toward the <LOCATION> Visayas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, she said. She added that on Sunday afternoon, about 24 hours before the <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> sank, the weather service issued an international shipping advisory warning of `` rough to very high seas'' along the route of the stricken vessel. She said warnings were updated every six hours. <PERSON> Vicente </PERSON> <PERSON> Gambito </PERSON>, a Sulpicio vice president, said the company received a message early Monday from the <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> that it was buffeted by giant waves south of <LOCATION> Masbate </LOCATION> island. <PERSON> Gambito </PERSON> said the company ordered the captain to change course for the west, using <LOCATION> Masbate </LOCATION> as a shield against the storm. Five hours later, the captain radioed the ship was taking in water and the condition was `` critical,'' he said. Meanwhile, Go said 139 survivors were aboard another company ship, the Princess, and expected in <LOCATION> Tacloban </LOCATION> later today. He said the others were still on <LOCATION> Maripipi </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Almagro </PERSON> and other small islands near where the vessel sank. Lt. <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Luscre </PERSON>, coast guard operations chief in <LOCATION> Iloilo </LOCATION>, said an undetermined number of survivors reached <LOCATION> Sicogon </LOCATION>, a tiny resort island off the coast of <LOCATION> Panay </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sicogon </PERSON> is about 100 miles west of where the ship sank.

 Those involved in freeing two <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gray whales from their icy enclave said the experience left a lasting impression. `` This is the wildest thing that's ever happened to me,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, one of two North Slope Borough wildlife biologists who babysat the whales since they were found two weeks ago trapped in ice so thin it would n't support a man's weight. `` It's crazy. It does n't make any sense, but it's wonderful,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> said. He said that at first, he did n't think the whales could be freed. `` No, I thought it was one of those exercises in futility that you had to do,'' he said. `` I learned a lot. I learned that with persistence, clear thinking and proper chain saws, you can do anything.'' His colleague, <PERSON> Geoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, who shared the vigil for night after cold, lonely night, said he was more optimistic from the beginning. `` It was just one of those things where you start out, and see what happens. I guess I always believed we'd get them out, but I never thought it would turn out the way it did.'' Whaling captain <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Brower </PERSON> also spent countless hours on the ice, offering his expertise and mobilizing the Eskimos who kept the whales alive and moving toward safety by cutting a path of more than 100 breathing holes. `` I'm really relieved,'' he said. `` I feel like my burden may be lifted.'' Rescue coordinator <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said he never had any doubts about the eventual success of the operation, which ended with the whales following the path cut by a Soviet icebreaker. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Skluzacek </PERSON> and <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrian </PERSON>, Minnesotans who showed up uninvited to provide de-icing equipment that enabled rescuers to keep the breathing holes open, were elated. `` Great,'' <PERSON> Skluzacek </PERSON> said of the whales' escape. `` Anything more than that one-word answer is too much. You ca n't describe the feeling. `` I could n't feel better now, no way, shape or how,'' he said as he went off to look for a cigar to celebrate. `` It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience,'' said <PERSON> Ferrian </PERSON>, <PERSON> Skuzacek </PERSON>'s brother-in-law. `` But if anybody asked me to do it again, I'd say no.'' The environmental group <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> hailed the spirit of cooperation that characterized the rescue. `` These whales showed us the way toward global consciousness and true international cooperation,'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> <PERSON> Plowden </PERSON>, the group's whale campaign coordinator, said in a statement released in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` If this much attention would only be paid to the plight of the hundreds of whales harpooned each year by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, the whales could truly be saved. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> praised the rescue in a statement from the White House. `` The human persistence and determination by so many individuals on behalf of these whales shows mankind's concern for the environment,'' he said. `` It has been an inspiring endeavor.'' The Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> noted those comments in its report on the story today.

 The meter showed the equivalent of $ 53,346 when <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> cabbie <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> drove into the record books today after a 69-day journey that started in front of Buckingham Palace. `` I ca n't believe we're really here,'' said an elated <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> as he pulled up in a familiar black cab at the steps of the <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> Opera House. The 14,148-mile <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> taxi ride was set up to raise money for children's charities. `` So much has happened, what an amazing adventure,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 57, shouted as he sprayed a magnum of champagne over the vehicle. `` We've seen the Taj Mahal, the <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> Palace, we've had prime ministers in the car, half an elephant _ even a camel.''

The taxi left <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Aug. 19 with four drivers, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> taxi driver <PERSON> Kanelli </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsiros </PERSON> and <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>.

He did n't change the tires once or have a puncture and said mechanical failures were minor. But he said drivers in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> are the world's worst. Organizers said the cab will be sold at auction later and the money given to an Australian children's charity. Miss Tsiros, the <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> cabbie, said the journey gave her the opportunity to see her 11-year-old foster son, <PERSON> Santosh </PERSON> <PERSON> Babru </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>.

 Now and then, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON> allows herself to think about what would happen if <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> does not come home. The brother she has not seen in 3 -LCB- years marked his 41st birthday today still in captivity. `` I tried to think what if he did n't come back, what if they killed him. I do n't know what I would do because I would be so angry,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Say </PERSON> said during a recent interview at her home in a lakeside community near <LOCATION> Cadiz </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s birthday, his fourth in captivity since he was abducted March 16, 1985, in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> was being celebrated with parties, prayer services and rallies by friends and well-wishers from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> to his home town of <LOCATION> Batavia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Anderson </LOCATION>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, is the longest held of the 14 foreign hostages abducted in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He was kidnapped by the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem faction called Islamic Jihad, or Holy War. `` We are n't forgetting him,'' said <PERSON> Terri </PERSON> <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Batavia </LOCATION>'s radio station <ORGANIZATION> WBAT </ORGANIZATION>, which along with a merchants group sponsored a birthday party with a huge cake decorated with 1,321 candles, one for each day of captivity. In <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, seven newspapers published a letter to <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> on the eve of his birthday from a group of journalists working for his release. `` We join our hearts with yours in yearning for your freedom. We greet you, we salute you and we encourage you,'' said the letter from the <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to Free <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. `` All free men and women who live by the pen share ... in your captivity.'' Mrs. Say, 47, who planned to spend <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s birthday with family and friends in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, has devoted most of her energy since his abduction to gaining his release. While she has tried to contemplate the worst, she and her husband, <PERSON> David </PERSON>, are hopeful her brother will see freedom by the presidential election, less than two weeks away. `` It's such an agony of anticipation,'' Mrs. Say said. `` Having been burned so many times in the past, you try not to think about it.'' Something else she would prefer not to think about is how to tell her brother of the family changes that have occurred during his absence. Their father, <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> died of cancer in February 1986. Four months later, their 46-year-old brother, <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, died of cancer. He died four days after making a videotape from his bed appealing to <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s captors. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s daughter <PERSON> Gabrielle </PERSON>, who was 10 years old when he was kidnapped, is now a teen-ager. He has yet to meet a second daughter, Sulome, whose third birthday was June 7. Mrs. Say, a quiet woman with piercing brown eyes, has led candlelight vigils outside the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and had coffee with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. In 1986, she made a 5,000-mile trip to the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION>, and she has appeared on national talk shows. `` I simply want my brother back,'' she said. Today, students at <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> planned to hold a rally on <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s behalf, while in <LOCATION> Catskill </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, parishioners of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrick </ORGANIZATION>'s church scheduled a prayer service. `` We see it as a chance to sensitize students to the issues of freedom,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> DeWald </PERSON>, a journalism professor who organized the rally. `` <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> is <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> America </PERSON> to us and we have to stand up for him.'' Students were to wear armbands with <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s name and sign a huge birthday card that will be forwarded to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> DeWald </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Smog Gas Shows Potential For Treating AIDS, Boosting Blood Safety</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scientists seeking AIDS treatments and ways to make donated blood even safer say their studies suggest an unusual potential weapon: ozone, the main gas in smog. `` I'm engaged in preliminary studies on the use of ozone in the treatment of AIDS, AIDS-related complex and intractable diarrhea'' often suffered by patients with the deadly disease, said Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpendale </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. In a pilot study, five AIDS and AIDS-related complex patients were given ozone rectally through a tube, said <PERSON> Carpendale </PERSON>, the hospital's chief of rehabilitative medicine. The treatment halted severe diarrhea in four of the patients, possibly by hindering the AIDS virus, he said Wednesday. <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, who conducted another ozone study, said they want to study whether the worsening of AIDS in patients might be slowed if some of their blood is removed, treated with ozone and replaced, or if they are given the gas rectally so it is absorbed quickly into their blood. The other study found ozone stopped the AIDS virus from multiplying in donated blood while leaving more than 90 percent of blood cells undamaged, said <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, until recently head of the AIDS unit and infectious disease division at the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, Md. The findings raise the possibility that ozone, often used to disinfect water and sewage, might be applied to further reduce the risk that donated blood could carry the AIDS virus, he said during the 28th Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy. Because blood donors are now tested, the chance of a unit of blood carrying the virus is 1 in 50,000 to 100,000, said Dr. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleinman </PERSON>, medical director of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> counties. <PERSON> Kleinman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s study suggests but does n't prove ozone could kill AIDS or other viruses in blood, but `` it's reasonable to try it out'' with more studies because `` we would like to make the risk much smaller.'' The use of ozone to sterilize donated blood or treat AIDS patients would have to be proved safe for humans, said Dr. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Rarick </PERSON>, a blood and cancer specialist and AIDS researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>. Medical uses of ozone have been limited largely to unsubstantiated treatments for various diseases by European holistic medicine practitioners. <PERSON> Rarick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kleinman </PERSON> said more studies must be done to determine if ozone not only stops the AIDS virus from multiplying in blood, but actually prevents virus components hiding in blood cells from infecting other cells. <PERSON> Rarick </PERSON> also questioned whether treating AIDS patients with ozone would destroy virus particles hiding in body tissues, something necessary to reduce symptoms. <PERSON> Carpendale </PERSON> said he plans to study that question. Nevertheless, the `` preliminary results warrant further investigation,'' <PERSON> Rarick </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> is now a senior researcher at the <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> Foundation for the <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, but conducted his study with colleagues at the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> before he retired from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 1. <PERSON> Carpendale </PERSON>'s study has n't been published, but he is seeking approval to treat 20 more AIDS patients with ozone. The use of ozone against AIDS may make many scientists `` roll their eyeballs,'' <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said. `` But when you have a very bad disease like this with no cure, you have to have an open mind.''

<HEAD>Murder Charge Against Hedda Nussbaum Dropped</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A woman no longer faces a murder charge in the beating death of the 6-year-old girl she and her live-in lover illegally adopted, but her attorney says she never will forgive herself for what happened. At the request of prosecutors, a judge dropped murder charges Wednesday against <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, who is expected to testify that her live-in companion, <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, killed <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, whom they obtained as a newborn from an unwed teen-age mother. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s murder trial was to resume today. Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> is expected to be the star witness against him. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCusker </PERSON>, in requesting that murder charges against Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> be dropped, said she was `` so physically and mentally incapacitated on the night of the murder that she was not criminally responsible for <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s death.'' <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Criminal Court Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stackhouse </PERSON> granted the motion. After the short hearing, which Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> attended, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheck </PERSON>, her lawyer, told reporters, `` The law had to excuse her, but she has n't excused herself. She never will.'' <PERSON> Scheck </PERSON> also said the former children's book editor `` would do anything to bring the child back.'' He praised the district attorney's decision not to prosecute her, saying it came `` after an unbelievably thorough and complicated investigation.'' Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, 46, and <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, 47, had been charged with second-degree murder in the death of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> last November. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> was indicted by a grand jury on the charge; Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> was not. She has undergone surgery and extensive psychiatric treatment in the past year for physical and emotional injuries that her lawyer has said were inflicted by <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s lawyer, <LOCATION> Ira </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said of the dismissal of the charge, `` I think it gives her an additional motive not to tell the truth. It certainly is an incentive to tell the district attorney what he wants to hear. But her credibility is a matter still for the jury to decide.'' During opening remarks at the trial Tuesday, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> called Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> `` delusional'' and told jurors they would learn of her `` self-destructive romance with satanic cults -LRB- and -RRB- her sadomasochistic behavior outside the home.'' <PERSON> Scheck </PERSON> on Wednesday said the implication of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s remarks was that Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>'s injuries were inflicted by someone other than <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. `` That suggestion is absurd,'' he said. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> was found unconscious in the couple's squalid <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> apartment Nov. 2 and died three days later. Her death drew national attention and made her a symbol of the plight of abused children. A 16-month-old boy, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, was found in the apartment sitting in a dirty diaper and tethered to a playpen, authorities said. He also was illegally adopted, and now lives with his biological mother.

 Radical students burned an effigy of Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> today and pelted riot police with hundreds of firebombs and rocks as anti-U.S. and anti-government protests continued on campuses. `` Drive out the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>,'' they shouted. Dozens of police were hit with rocks and burned by exploding firebombs in violent protests at two university campuses in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> Konkuk </ORGANIZATION> and Dongkuk. The demonstrations were confined to the streets in front of the campuses. Earlier today, about 20 students shouting `` Yankee go home'' attacked the <LOCATION> Koram </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, a Korea-U.S. joint venture bank in southern <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, with firebombs and rocks. Police said two students were arrested. No damage was reported. At <ORGANIZATION> Seoul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, about 300 students demonstrated peacefully, demanding the withdrawal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers and nuclear weapons they claim the American military keeps in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Students also urged the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to repeal its agreement with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> that allows the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military jurisdiction over military personnel and their dependents involved in criminal proceedings. On two campuses in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taegu </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, police said hundreds of students hurled firebombs and stones and police fired tear gas to block them from marching off their campuses after anti-government, anti-U.S. rallies. It was not immediately known if anyone was injured or arrested. Anti-U.S. protests have been on the rise in recent weeks, fanned by radical students demanding the withdrawal of the 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed here under a mutual defense pact. On Wednesday, radicals attacked a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cultural center in <LOCATION> Taegu </LOCATION>, damaging three cars in the center in the third assault on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities in two weeks. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military authorities confirmed today that tight security measures adopted at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> installations during the Olympic Games would continue due to `` continued unsettled conditions.'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Fullerton </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the military would continue procedures such as tightened identification checks and security monitoring. He said an advisory aimed at military personnel and their families was issued through the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> and the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stars </ORGANIZATION> and Stripes. The advisory cautioned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops to `` be mindful of their personal conduct while off <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> installations'' and not to interfere in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> political affairs. The release also said local commanders may further increase security around their installations to avoid potential problems related to `` continued unsettled conditions.'' South Korean police also have stepped up security around <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> legations with more contingents of police patrols in response to firebomb attacks by radical students.

 The president of a paper supply company being investigated in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> fraud and bribery probe told employees to throw out documents that prosecutors say contained incriminating evidence, court papers show. Federal agents seized the documents later that day, June 21, from trash containers at the <ORGANIZATION> Kane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, according to the search warrant application, which along with other court papers was first made public Wednesday. The papers, released by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Korman </PERSON> in response to a newspaper request, show that <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, the firm's founder, called his company three times to talk with employees about throwing out business papers <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>'s conversations were intercepted by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents who had been secretly monitoring phone conversations at <ORGANIZATION> Kane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION>, which supplies paper products to aerospace companies. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> is also the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and has been described by officials as an associate of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, a private consultant and a former vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> whose home has also been searched. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> is one of the nation's largest computer manufacturers and a major military contractor. Search warrants were served at the company's <LOCATION> Eagen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, and Great Neck plants. A secretary at <ORGANIZATION> Kane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> was out of town Wednesday and unavailable for comment. A message left with <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, was not immediately returned. Authorities have said agents deliberately had not gone to <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>'s plant on June 14 when they staged the first nationwide series of raids involving the defense contracting scandal because they wanted to continue monitoring the wiretaps On June 21, <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> called in the morning and spoke to an employee identified as <PERSON> Thomasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Avellina </PERSON>, according to court testimony by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Melore </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> says to <LOCATION> Avellina </LOCATION>, ` I think what you should do quietly is go through anything that might be around, that you want to get rid of, OK?''' <PERSON> Melore </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Avellina </PERSON> says, ` To throw them out?''' <PERSON> Melore </PERSON> said. `` Kane: ` No. Yeah.''' Avellina answers, ` OK,''' <PERSON> Melore </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> again called <PERSON> Avellina </PERSON> in mid-morning and asked him, `` Did you get rid of the -LRB- blank -RRB- did you get rid of most of yours,'' <PERSON> Melore </PERSON> said. `` Avellina: yeah.'' <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> called a third time around noon and spoke with another employee, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, to ask if <PERSON> Avellina </PERSON> had thrown out the documents, <PERSON> Melore </PERSON> said. Under questioning by <PERSON> Korman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Melore </PERSON> said agents at the plant had seen business documents in at least one trash container. Those documents were later seized. `` That's the circumstances which leads us to believe that at this point they were attempting to destroy incriminating documents,'' <PERSON> Melore </PERSON> said. Court documents made public earlier indicated that investigators were seeking information at Kane Paper about the possible extortion of campaign contributions from companies by private consultants and others. <PERSON> Korman </PERSON> also questioned <PERSON> Melore </PERSON> about <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>'s relationship with <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>. `` I know when we did the wiretap, you persuaded me that <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> was engaging in conversations with <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> that would relate and could relate to the Unisys matter in which <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> was involved,'' <PERSON> Korman </PERSON> said. `` But with respect to documents that are at <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>'s place of business, that's another story. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> was n't involved in defrauding <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>.''

<HEAD>High Number Of Leukemia Deaths Reported Near Savannah River Plant</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Nuclear Safety</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AIKEN, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal study of workers at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> nuclear plant found twice the usual rate of deaths from leukemia. The finding by the <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Epidemiologic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> is consistent with the results of a study by the <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> released in 1976, plant officials said in a statement Wednesday. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> runs the federal plant under contract. The Oak Ridge study included 1,274 male hourly workers who were hired before 1955 and worked five to 15 years. Overall, they had fewer than expected deaths from all causes, but six leukemia deaths, a greater number than would be expected. `` The finding of an increase in the number of leukemia deaths in this population warrants further investigation. We are conducting a study in which a full assessment will be made of radiation and chemical exposure,'' said <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cragle </PERSON>, head of a team of researchers at the Oak Ridge center. <PERSON> Cragle </PERSON> said in a statement released by the plant that further studies are under way to determine if the leukemia deaths are in any way related to the workers' exposure to radiation or chemicals on the job. Radiation monitoring data for the men who died of leukemia showed that all were exposed to less than the current annual occupational radiation limit. The researchers' findings were reported this month in the American Journal of Industrial Medicine. They have been presented to plant employees and managers. <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universities </ORGANIZATION> is a private, non-profit association of 49 colleges and universities based in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> that is a management and operating contractor for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>. In a related development, a national group of 60,000 physicians and medical students called Wednesday for the creation of a national medical board to assess public and environmental health problems associated with the operation of the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> plant and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear weapons plants. Physicians for Social Responsibility said production of nuclear weapons should not be resumed at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> until public health questions related to the plant's operation are resolved. And 28 members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> called Wednesday for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> to prove that the plant's reactors are safe before they are restarted In separate but similar letters to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>, the bi-partisan coalition also urged the department to ask for enough money to correct mounting technical and environmental problems at the facility, near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, and at other nuclear weapons production facilities. The letters, written by Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Spratt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, and signed by about 27 others, place blame for the deteriorating complex on the department. They say the result is that the nation is `` unable to produce nuclear materials needed to maintain the deterrent value of our nuclear weapons.'' Unlike a similar letter signed last week by 12 congressmen, the <PERSON> Spratt </PERSON> letters do not criticize <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> or any other contractors that operate <PERSON> DOE </PERSON>'s weapons facilities. `` The crisis has not arisen suddenly but over a long period, and it stems from inadequate attention to maintenance, safety and operating conditions,'' said the letter to <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>. Among the demands in the letter to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is the appointment of a five-member safety panel approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> during the summer. The panel would represent another check on the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s operations <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> announced Oct. 11 that the department plans to restart one of the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> reactors by Dec. 31. Except for an abortive attempt to restart another reactor in August, all of the plant's reactors have been shut since April due to safety concerns.

<HEAD>Hollywood Teamsters Strike Settlement Goes To Vote</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Striking Hollywood Teamsters were scheduled to vote on a tentative settlement with producers that a union leader expressed little enthusiasm over but predicted will be ratified to end the 24-day-old walkout. `` There's no winner,'' <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local 399, said Wednesday in announcing the tentative pact. `` It's time to go back to work and get the industry back on its feet.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>, on strike since Oct. 3, were scheduled to vote on the three-year contract this afternoon. If approved, the 2,100 studio drivers represented by the local could return to work at the beginning of next week. Results of the balloting were expected late tonight or Friday, officials said. It also was disclosed Wednesday that 600 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Laborers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> settled their strike with the producers and will return to work Monday. And representatives of about 100 striking studio electricians were reported to have concluded their negotiations with the producers late Wednesday and also are supposed to vote today on their pact. At a news conference to announce the settlement, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> showed obvious displeasure over the agreement in the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> strike and refused to say whether he would recommend it to union members. `` I can recommend that it's time to end the strike or a lockout,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` That's a lot different than recommending that this package is good or recommending to the members that they should be accepting on the terms of the package.'' Neither <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Counter </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION>, would give details of the pact. But a source told the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that union lost on a major issue in the strike, new rules for overtime. Under the new contract, a driver will only be paid overtime on Saturday or Sunday if working on those days means putting in more than 40 hours a week, the source told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. Previously, drivers were paid overtime for all weekend work. The agreement also would give most drivers 45-cent-an-hour wage increases for each of the next three years, the newspaper reported. The basic driver's wage under the current contract is $ 16.61 an hour. The studios have used replacement drivers during the strike, but the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> are expected to get their jobs back, the Times said.

 <PERSON> Vilma </PERSON> <PERSON> Bande </PERSON> was frightened as giant waves rocked the passenger ship <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, but the crew urged her to remain calm and take off her life jacket. Moments later, she was adrift in stormy seas and the vessel was gone. The 19-year-old nurse, en route to visit her parents in <LOCATION> Tacloban </LOCATION>, was among up to 500 passengers bound for <LOCATION> Tacloban </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> aboard the ship when it sank Monday during the height of Typhoon Ruby. She and more than 100 other survivors _ dazed and sullen after their ordeal _ arrived today in this city 350 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. The survivors included at least six children, one a 4-year-old girl. Asked what happened to her parents, the girl sighed: `` They're gone. Survivors appeared bruised and shaken. Several told of struggling for three or more hours in violent seas before washing ashore on small islands near where the vessel sank. Few survivors smiled or waved as they walked from the ship that brought them to <LOCATION> Tacloban </LOCATION>. Some still clutched the life jackets that had saved them. In <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> guard </ORGANIZATION> said some survivors remained today on small islands _ too shaken to agree to board rescue vessels. Officials said several were in shock. Miss <PERSON> Bande </PERSON> said that as giant waves battered the 2,855-ton <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> on Monday, she and hundreds of others anxiously waited on deck as the crew frantically tried to pump water from the ship. `` There was no announcement. The crew members were shouting ` do n't panic, remove your life jackets, relax, this is normal,''' she said. But few passengers, if any, heeded the advice. Suddenly, she recalled, a giant wave `` as tall as a building'' crashed over the deck and the vessel rolled to the side. `` I jumped and in less than one minute, I turned my back and the ship was gone,'' she said. <PERSON> Lea </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>, 29, donned a life jacket and leaped into the raging sea although she did not know how to swim. `` I was struggling in the water,'' she said. `` I saw a piece of wood and clung to it. The next thing I knew, somebody grabbed me and helped me to shore.'' Miss <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> washed ashore on <PERSON> Almagro </PERSON> island, about 20 miles from where officials believe the <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> sank. She said some island fishermen braved the raging seas and set out in small boats to rescue passengers. Other survivors washed up on the beaches, barely strong enough to walk. The ordeal has left Miss Hugo, a nurse, temporarily blinded. Still, she is thankful to be alive. `` I am looking at you but I can only see your silhouette,'' she said as tears streamed down her bruised face. `` I guess I'm just lucky.''

<HEAD>Explorer Hopes To Recover Boston Tea Party Chests</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An undersea explorer who found a wrecked pirate ship four years ago believes he can locate the site of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and hopes to recover some of the 342 chests dumped into <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> in 1773. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> said he will ask the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Underwater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archaeological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> for a permit to survey what he believes is the Tea Party site and thesites of other harbor shipwrecks dating back to 1612. `` We have very high hopes of finding these chests in very good condition,'' <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> said. `` We have every reason to believe that they would be in a fairly close radius to the original site and obviously buried in the mud.'' <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>, the 43-year-old president of <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Explorations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chatham </LOCATION>, said he and his assistants have surveyed the harbor with electronic image-gathering equipment for 18 months in an effort to pinpoint the location. He declined to say where he believes the <ORGANIZATION> Tea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> occurred, fearing the site might be raided, but he said it is in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Channel </LOCATION>, not far from where the <PERSON> Beaver </PERSON>, a replica of one of the <ORGANIZATION> Tea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ships, is docked. While some of the chests probably floated away, many should be in the area under four to 10 feet of mud, <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> said. The chests are believed to be 16 inches long, 12 inches wide, and 12 inches high and covered with lacquer and enamel. `` Chinese lacquer is impervious to water, and with the mud acting as a refrigerator, our chemists feel there's a good chance that some of these chests will be in good condition.'' <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cahill </PERSON>, described as an expert on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> shipwrecks, told the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> each chest could be worth as much as $ 1 million depending on its interest as an historical artifact. The Tea Party was a protest against the three-penny tax King <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> imposed on American colonists for a pound of tea. On Dec. 16, 1773, 30 patriots, dressed as <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>, raided three ships in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, hauling crates containing tea chests to the decks, opening the chests and throwing them into the ocean. In 1984, <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> located the 18th century pirate ship Whydah off <LOCATION> Wellfleet </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION>. He said he has excavated less than 4 percent of the treasure, estimated at millions of dollars, that was on that ship.

 Israeli soldiers shot and wounded 14 Palestinians during stone-throwing clashes in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> today, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports and hospital officials said. A fundamentalist Moslem group called for more general strikes against Israeli occupation. `` Let's burn the land under the occupiers,'' said a leaflet distributed by the <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION>, or Zeal, movement. The PLO-backed underground leadership of the Palestinian uprising also issued a new leaflet, addressed to the Israeli people, appealing for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s withdrawal from the occupied lands and establishment of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. Clashes with soldiers were reported in at least four cities and towns in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. The army said it was checking reports of 14 Palestinians wounded. In <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> youths threw stones and bottles at soldiers at a protest called by underground leaders against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s demand for new license plates on <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> cars, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters said. Soldiers responded with tear gas and live ammunition, wounding six Palestinians ranging in age from 14 to 24, said officials at <ORGANIZATION> Al-Ittihad </ORGANIZATION> and St. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s hospitals. The protest involved hundreds of cars and trucks blocking roads in response to an appeal over loudspeakers to stop vehicles wherever they were at 9 a.m. The move was to protest a plan to require license plates that show exactly where the car is registered and cost owners $ 250. A 17-year-old girl and a 16-year-old boy were wounded in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Idna </LOCATION>, according to hospital officials who said soldiers shot when residents tried to block an army unit from entering the village near <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, six Palestinians were reported shot with plastic bullets after a stone-throwing melee began on <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and youths set ablaze tires in the Khan Yunis refugee camp. One of the wounded in <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> was a 41-year-old woman shot in the chest with a plastic bullet, hospital officials said. Three schools in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> were ordered closed by the army today to halt violence, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. They said three other schools were shut down by soldiers Wednesday in <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON>. In violence Wednesday, a 3-year-old Palestinian girl died in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> town of <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON>, and her family claimed the death was caused by tear gas inhalation, the army said. Arab sources said 10 Palestinians were shot and wounded by soldiers during scattered clashes with soldiers. At least 303 Palestinians have been killed, along with six Israelis, since the uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation began last Dec. 8. The new <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> leaflet urged Palestinians to stage four general strikes against Israeli rule in the next three weeks.

 Bright yellow handbills offering free food for the homeless turned out to be bogus after dozens of people showed up looking for dinner at a downtown restaurant. `` I'm really outraged,'' said <PERSON> Lymon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindstrom </PERSON>, a homeless person who waited outside the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbeque </LOCATION> restaurant for several hours Wednesday before finding out the offer was a hoax. The sponsor was listed as the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Active </ORGANIZATION> 20 +30 Club, a charitable organization with about 30 members which was having a meeting inside the restaurant at the time the handbills said the free dinners would be served `` Someone is playing a joke. That's all I know,'' said club president <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kvaas </PERSON>, whose phone number was on the handbills. <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, one of the restaurant owners, said limited supplies made it impossible to provide food for those attracted by the handbills. An apology sign was placed in a window. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Sapper </PERSON>, a former club president whom the handbills credited with donating their printing cost, called the incident `` a cruel hoax'' by unknown individuals. `` We do n't understand any of this. We've done a lot of good things for the community,'' said <PERSON> Sapper </PERSON>, noting that helping underprivileged children has been a primary focus for the group.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said today Americans should vote for Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` as an act of self-defense'' because Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> favors gun controls, and to say `` no'' to higher taxes. Playing to the conservative values of his audience of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> partisans at a Little Rock airport rally, the president portrayed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a far-out liberal who would raise taxes and threaten the nation's defenses _ but is trying to disguise his real goals from the voters. `` I have to say, how can a man running for president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> look the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people in the eye and tell you that his ideology does n't matter?'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asked in a prepared speech. In one of his hardest-hitting speeches yet as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief surrogate on the campaign trail, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> suggested that the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor has used his newly toughened attacks on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee to hide his own liberal record. `` Ladies and gentlemen, if he is saying to you that what he believes does n't matter, is n't he really saying that what each one of us believes does n't matter?'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asked. Embarking on a week-long, cross-country tour, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was traveling from <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to tout his vice president as crime-busting yet compassionate man who deserves to inherit the White House Oval Office. `` On Nov. 8th, go into that polling booth and do some negative campaigning of your own, the right kind of negative campaigning: Say ` no' to new taxes and ` yes' to the Republican ticket,'' the president told his audience. He charged that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would allow only `` the military and police'' to carry guns, and said voters should cast their ballots for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his running mate, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, `` as an act of self-defense.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says he wants to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, but favors their ownership by hunters, sportsmen and homeowners who want to protect their lives and property. Throughout his speech, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> boasted of what `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> and I'' had achieved. `` For eight years, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and I have worked side-by-side in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, during times of crisis and times of historic triumph and achievements,'' he said. For example, the president said, `` You know, violent crime has fallen significantly since 1981 because <PERSON> George </PERSON> and I put criminals on notice.'' The president claimed that under <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s leadership, a federal task force had slashed 600 million man-hours of paperwork a year from the government's workload, spearheaded the administration's anti-drug offensive and paved the way toward the U.S.-Soviet treaty banning medium-range nuclear missiles <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as `` strong, decent loyal, wise, capable and compassionate _ a man who has the qualities necessary to fill the office of president.'' He added: `` As for a certain governor from a certain <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> state, I'd best let someone else do the talking. Former <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Congressman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bethune </PERSON> said he'd met this fellow 10 years ago and his reaction was, let me quote him now, ` I have never met a person in my whole life who is more liberal'.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, obviously buoyed by recent polls showing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> widening his lead over the Democratic nominee, said, `` I have little doubt that the people of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are going to do exactly what I did eight years ago: They are going to choose <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' At a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> fund-raising luncheon Wednesday in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, the president said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has Democrats `` squirming'' and `` squealing'' because he's shown them to be what `` they really are,'' as liberals who stand outside the mainstream of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> values. In light of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s double-digit leads in the polls, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also will spend some time next week boosting local <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates in several cities in southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, as well as <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. Amid his hectic schedule of cross-country campaigning, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has sandwiched in a weekend respite at his <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> ranch with his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>. Since Labor Day, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has made 21 political appearances in 13 states and has raised about $ 8.8 million for the national and state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> campaign coffers.

<HEAD>Second Canadian Back in Running for PTL</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A second Canadian businessman is back in the bidding for the assets of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, the financially troubled ministry of deposed television evangelist <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. Real estate magnate <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> to consider his proposal along with that of <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. Four of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s largest creditors joined in <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>' motion, which was filed Wednesday in federal bankruptcy court. Attorneys for two creditors said they were n't endorsing <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>'s $ 113 million offer over <ORGANIZATION> Mernick </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 115 million bid, but that they want <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> to have a choice from at least two competing bids. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> is scheduled to rule on <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>' motion Nov. 16, which is the same day he has set to consider a motion approving a sale to <LOCATION> Mernick </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, which has been in bankruptcy proceedings since June 1987, must sell its assets to pay debts that could amount to more than $ 130 million. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s holdings include the 500-acre <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> theme park, 1,700 acres of undeveloped land and the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> satellite TV network. <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> had apparently won the bidding Oct. 4, when <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> trustee M.C. `` Red'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> accepted his $ 115 million offer and promised not to negotiate further with anyone else. Other bidders can go directly to the court, but none had done so until <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> filed his motion Wednesday. In accepting <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>'s bid, <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said he had rejected a $ 113 million offer by <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> in September, because <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>'s $ 46 million cash down payment would not be due until September 1989. <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>'s offer includes $ 50 million cash by Dec. 31. However, <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> has until Nov. 15 to back out of the deal with no penalty. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>' new offer still has a $ 113 million total price, but matches <ORGANIZATION> Mernick </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 50 million cash. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> would have until Feb. 28 to back out, and until June 30 to close the sale and come up with the cash. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> announced his re-entry in the bidding at his <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, headquarters. `` We're elated,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` We did n't like being on the sidelines. We always felt our offer was one of the best.'' In a telephone interview with The <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Observer, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said he thinks his offer may be more attractive to <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> because he promises to maintain <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> as a Christian retreat, while <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>, who is Jewish, makes no such pledge. `` I think <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>'s and my offers are so dramatically different that it's right the judge should look at them,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` My offer is committed to keep the ambience of the site like it is ... and Mr. <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>'s offer is more of paving it and putting a shopping center on it.'' <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> said two weeks ago that he had made no decision about what he would do with <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, but added that the undeveloped land would be `` excellent for condominiums, shopping centers and commercial buildings.''

 Smarting from one of the heaviest Israeli air raids on their strongholds this year, Palestinians today buried 19 people killed in an air assault and ensuing ground battle near the port city of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organiztaion </ORGANIZATION> said it planned mass funerals for the victims, they were buried in quiet ceremonies in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>'s main cemetery and a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> graveyard in the nearby village of <LOCATION> Darb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Seem </LOCATION>. There were no anti-Israeli chants or cries for revenge that had characterized funerals for victims of previous Israeli attacks. `` We just could n't risk mass gatherings,'' said a guerrilla officer at one of the funerals. He refused to give his name. `` With <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s appetite for attacking at its peak, we figured it's prudent to keep a low profile.'' Police said rescuers using gasoline lanterns searched the rubble of a guerrilla base of 30 buildings pulverized in the Wednesday morning bombing of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>'s Mieh Mieh refugee camp. They dug out nine bodies. A family of six _ a man, his wife and their two sons and daughters _ were among the bodies. The children's ages ranged between six and 15, police said. The three other victims were guerrillas. Six bodies were found immediately after the air raid on the base, which belonged to <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Aarafat </PERSON>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group. Four other Palestinian guerrillas were killed in a ground battle that began after the raid with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s main proxy force, the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> militia. The four guerrillas belonged to the radical <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which is headed by the notorious <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> terrorist mastermind, <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>. The Mieh Mieh air raid claimed the second heaviest casualty toll of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 18 air strikes in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. Twenty-six people were killed and 30 wounded in the first air raid north of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> Jan. 3. Police and guerrilla spokesmen regarded Wednesday's assault as the worst in terms of destruction and guerrilla casualties. `` Mieh Mieh has suffered the most severe destruction since <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 1982 invasion'' of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said a police spokesman in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. He can not be named under standing regulations. Among those killed was Col. <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON>, commander of the 1,000-strong Fatah militia. The Mieh Mieh raid was followed 4 -LCB- hours later by two bombing runs against guerrilla bases of pro-Syrian Palestinian factions just south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and in hills overlooking the coastal town of <LOCATION> Damour </LOCATION>, midway between <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. At least one guerrilla was wounded. The Israeli strikes followed two foiled Palestinian guerrilla attempts to infiltrate into northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Tuesday. The attempts were uncovered by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops and the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SLA </ORGANIZATION> militiamen who patrol <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-designated `` security zone'' in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> warplanes struck bases in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Friday and Sunday in retaliation for a suicide car bombing in the security zone last week in which eight <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers were killed and nine people wounded. Twenty-one people were killed and 34 wounded in the two strikes, which were directed against Palestinian and Lebanese Shiite Moslem bases in south and southeast <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, had claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing.

 Democrats and Republicans traded recriminations after condemned multiple murderer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON> apparently criticized the use of his name in <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> campaign leaflets as `` disgusting and exploitive.'' <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON>, through a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>, confirmed Wednesday that he sent a letter to <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> officials about leaflets that say <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON> would have been `` eligible for weekend passes'' had he committed his 33 murders in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' home state. The Republican leaflets were labeled `` garbage'' earlier this month by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic presidential candidate. And GOP presidential candidate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Saturday he disapproved of them. But <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> communications director for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign, suggested Wednesday that Republicans might have somehow concocted <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON>'s letter `` It is really right up their alley, and an alley is where they are trying to conduct the campaign,'' she said. `` The language in that letter is language out of a campaign brochure. Tell me how a man on Death Row is so well informed about the inner workings of a presidential campaign.'' Earlier, <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Piper </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, had characterized the letter by saying, `` Here again we have another example of a criminal who is apparently supportive of <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' Later, he denied any party involvement. `` We do n't condone such campaign tactics or those remarks from the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign,'' he said. `` We held this letter for two days and it was n't until <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON> apparently sent this letter to a news organization that this story came about. We had nothing to do with it and did n't feel that it merited any further public discussion due to the source.'' In a one-page typewritten letter received Monday at state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON> wrote: `` It is an insult to the voting public that the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has to drop to such a sleazy level by exploiting the name of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON> in order to scare people into voting for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' A virtually identical letter, dated Oct. 23, was mailed to The Associated Press. After a request from the AP, <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> officials provided a copy of the letter they received. The letter sent to the Republicans called the campaign literature `` disgusting and exploitive'' and said, `` Ca n't <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> run on his own record and the truth, instead of all this scarey -LRB- sic -RRB- fantasy?'' The state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> mailings refer to a furlough program for prisoners carried on under <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' administration and to a convicted killer, <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, who brutalized a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> couple while on furlough from a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prison. `` If <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON> had committed his atrocious crimes in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> instead of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, he would be eligible for weekend passes under <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' furlough program,'' the leaflets said. <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON> was convicted in 1980 in the killings of 33 young men and boys, 29 of whom were found buried in his home near <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. He was sentenced to death and is imprisoned at the <ORGANIZATION> Menard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, but appeals are pending.

 An 8-year-old girl who was allegedly beaten to death by members of a commune founded by her father was mourned by about 150 people, including her uncle, who said he hoped others could learn from the tragedy. <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorea </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON>'s uncle, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, was the only speaker at the funeral Wednesday at the <ORGANIZATION> Angelus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crenshaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chapel </ORGANIZATION> to refer directly to the circumstances surrounding the girl's death. `` This is an experience that we've never experienced before,'' <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> told the mourners, as <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON>'s body lay in a pink embossed casket. `` Through this experience may we learn to love one another better and to experience life more.'' The girl's parents did not attend the service. <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON>, who would have turned 9 on Monday, died Oct. 14 allegedly from beatings and whippings administered by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Ecclesia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a group formed to help inner-city children. The girl's parents stayed away from the funeral because of the media attention it has attracted, said the child's maternal grandmother, <PERSON> Viola </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, who arranged the service. <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a former college basketball star in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, organized the athletic commune in <LOCATION> Sandy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, as a training center and an extension of the <ORGANIZATION> Watts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, founded by his father. Authorities in <LOCATION> Clackamas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, have alleged that the children found at a home there were forced to watch as adults, using paddles or electrical cords, administered ritualistic beatings to children. <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> at the time of his daughter's death but has since returned to <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> has maintained that Ecclesia no longer exists, sabotaged by biased news media portrayals that likened his group to a cult. He also has blamed the media for his daughter's death. Four people have been charged with first-degree manslaughter in the Ecclesia case, and the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> has taken more than 50 children into protective custody. The four people charged in the girl's death have pleaded innocent. Meanwhile, a misdemeanor complaint alleging child endangerment and inflicting illegal corporal punishment was filed Wednesday in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> against <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON>, the 25-year-old brother of <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON>. The complaint stemmed from a police visit to the <ORGANIZATION> Watts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 16 that was prompted by news reports of <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON>'s death in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Qualls </PERSON>, a spokesman for City Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>. Officers at the center found a 10-year-old boy with bruises who said he had been struck by <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said in a statement.

 A young Japanese woman had the trip of a lifetime on a flight from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> _ a choice of 353 seats, six movies, a gourmet menu and the exclusive attention of 15 cabin attendants. <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> said today that the woman, identified only as Mrs. <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON>, was the lone passenger on the 8,000-mile Flight 008 of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747, which arrived at Heathrow Airport Tuesday afternoon. `` The jumbo was delayed going into <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and by the time it set off for <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> all the other passengers had been re-booked on to other flights,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, who by custom was not identified. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON> had actually arrived early at the airport for another <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> flight which was leaving later. But since she was there, she was offered the opportunity for the flight of a lifetime,'' the spokesman said. `` We had to come back empty because the jumbo was due back in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to get back into its schedule.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON>, on her way to join her husband, who is studying at <ORGANIZATION> Salford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION>, had paid the standard $ 2,975 economy fare for the 11-hour trip. But she sat in business class, dined on poached salmon and watched Goldie Hawn in `` Overboard.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> estimated the flight cost at least $ 22,750 _ $ 17,500 for fuel and $ 5,250 in wages for the cabin attendants and six flight deck crew. `` We're certainly not aware of it ever happening before and I'm sure Mrs. <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON> saw British Airways in-flight service at its best,'' the spokesman said In <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyle </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` It's the first time we have heard of something like this.

 Personal trips taken by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> on his military aircraft over a 30-month period cost the government nearly $ 1.9 million, with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> paying only the price of economy-class airfare, a congressional report says. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report says <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> took 23 personal trips during the 30 months ended last July, most of them visits to family homes at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Cummington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. Most of the time <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was accompanied only by his wife, <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>. The total bill for those trips came to $ 1,892,214, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in a report released Wednesday. Most of the money was spent for <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>' military plane, its sophisticated communications equipment and the secretary's security personnel, the review said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> reimbursed the government for less than 1 percent of the cost, basing his repayment rate on the economy air fare rate to a destination plus $ 1, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials told the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>. The total amount <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> reimbursed the government was $ 18,783, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>' annual Cabinet salary is $ 99,030. His net worth is unavailable, but his financial disclosure form filed earlier this year shows that a blind trust created from his holdings had income last year in excess of $ 100,000. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> used the military plane because `` the secretary of state is the secretary of state 24 hours a day, 365 days a year,'' no matter where he is. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has followed the practice used by other secretaries of state for the past 15 or 20 years. Many other Cabinet members also use military aircraft for reasons of improved security and communications, he said. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> added, `` The fact of the matter is that the security threat does n't disappear just because the secretary happens to be on vacation, nor does the need for communications.'' The bulk of the $ 1.89 million cost for the 23 trips went for military aircraft _ $ 797,219, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. Hotel accommodations for security personnel and other aides cost $ 336,414; overtime for those personnel cost $ 256,205; per diem food costs were $ 183,030; and $ 141,464 was spent to install telephone lines. In addition to the 23 personal trips, the study listed a series of other trips by <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> between 1982 and 1986 that were listed as official travel, but which also included a private component. Those trips were n't among the 23 whose expenses were totaled by the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said today the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has `` no choice'' but to tear down the nearly complete <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> because the facility is riddled with eavesdropping devices. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, walking toward his helicopter to begin a campaign trip to <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, was asked if he had decided the embassy must be demolished. `` Yes,'' he replied, `` because there's no way to rid it of the many listening devices that were built into it.'' `` We have to do it. We have no choice,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Asked where the money would be found for a replacement, he replied, `` We'll take it away from something else.'' `` We're going to start and have an American-built one,'' he said of the embassy. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will recommend to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that the embassy be razed and rebuilt, at a cost estimated at $ 300 million. The newspaper said it could take five years to build a replacement eight-story embassy on the same site with materials imported from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources have said Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> recommended the move to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> after the unfinished building was inspected by a congressional delegation and a private engineering firm. The first eavesdropping bugs, in structural elements built elsewhere by Soviet workers and transported to the site, were discovered by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspectors in the spring of 1987. One member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who toured the facility, Rep. <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, said in September that $ 38 million remained in previously approved enbassy-construction appropriations to dismantle the unoccupied embassy. But Rep. <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION> BDM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which inspected the facility for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said the dismantling could cost $ 160 million. Construction of the bug-riddled embassy and studies about its future have cost nearly $ 60 million. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said officials now plan to fabricate the building's main elements in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, ship them to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, keep them under heavy guard and have the building assembled by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> workers taken to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for the construction project. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said that until a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy is occupied Soviet officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will be barred from using their long-completed but unoccupied embassy office building. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> agreed in 1972 to build new, larger embassies in each other's capital.

<HEAD>Prices of Imported Goods Dropped 1.1 Percent From July Through
September</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prices of imported goods dropped 1.1 percent from July through September, the first quarterly decline in more than two years, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the decline, which followed a 2.6 percent second quarter increase, reflected widespread drops in a variety of imported goods. Only the cost of chemicals showed an increase for the quarter, rising by 2.7 percent. By contrast, crude oil and other imported fuels fell by a steep 7.1 percent while the cost of imported food dropped 1.1 percent and imported machinery prices dipped 0.5 percent. Without the big drop in energy prices, all imported goods still would have registered a 0.6 percent price drop during the quarter after a 2.4 percent rise in the previous quarter. It is the first drop in import prices since the first quarter of 1986, when prices fell 3.3 percent. Part of the price decline reflected the fact that the dollar's value on foreign exchange rates rose during the quarter. Even with the July through September decline, import prices are still 4.1 percent higher than they were a year ago. The price of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports rose 2 percent during the third quarter and now stands 8.7 percenting the impact of the summer drought in the Farm Belt as grain prices rose sharply. Food exports had risen by 8.6 percent in the second quarter and are now 36.8 percent higher than a year ago. In contrast, prices of crude materials, which had been rising rapidly, edged up just 0.6 percent in the third quarter, the smallest increase in two years. The category of machinery and transport equipment, which constitutes nearly one-half of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports, rose by 0.5 percent in the third quarter following a 0.8 percent rise in the second quarter.

<HEAD>U.S. Customs Inspectors Claim Computer System Lets Illegal Drugs

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> inspectors are protesting a computer system that they say allows more drugs to enter the country because it tells them how thoroughly to search, or not to search, cargo shipments. Seven years ago, <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> agents say, they examined about a quarter of all cargo imported through <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, but now 90 percent of the items pass through untouched under the program that has computers target likely contraband shipments. `` They have created an honor system for importers,'' said <PERSON> Reta </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, president-elect of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` Instead of being on site to inspect merchandise, we are sitting behind computers. It's like taking a policeman off the beat and putting him in an office and expecting him to do his job.'' But agency administrators say that the nationwide computer system that was the target of the protest Wednesday was responsible for recent seizures of large amounts of cocaine and that any problems with the system were being corrected. `` We know that incidents have happened and where we can make a change or an adjustment we do that,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, deputy assistant regional commissioner of commercial operations for the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` If it was not for the system, there would be a lot more incidents and shipments of drugs getting through.'' About 20 Customs workers picketed outside the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> airport, carrying signs bearing slogans such as `` Customs computer system is a welcome mat for drug smugglers'' and `` Customs commission's computers create chaos. Federal workers also demonstrated outside the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s regional office in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, and similar demonstrations were held at other large ports of entry The Customs Service began using the computer system in 1984 and it is now operating at all of the 300 official ports of entry in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said spokesman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Kittredge </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The system targets specific cargo shipments for thorough searches based on various criteria, including whether the shipment is a first-time import to a particular company, whether the merchandise comes from a drug-related country and whether people suspected by the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> handled the goods, he said. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartnett </PERSON>, a customs inspector at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, said the agency was relying too much on the computers. `` Computers are good, but they should be a tool and not the sole thing the agency relies on, and that's what's happened,'' said <PERSON> Hartnett </PERSON>. `` When the computer and the inspector disagree, the final vote should go to the inspector.'' While inspectors technically may ignore the computer's advice, `` We've been told that when the computer said an extensive search was not necessary we should go along with it,'' <PERSON> Hartnett </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kittredge </PERSON> said the computer is only a tool. `` Any inspector is encouraged to look at any cargo he or she suspects,'' he said. In at least one case, drugs were discovered by inspectors who disregarded the computer's determination that a shipment needed only a cursory check, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, a union spokesman in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. In that incident in July, the computer said a shipment labeled coffee that arrived at <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> did not need to be checked thoroughly, he said. But the inspector was suspicious because the shipment weight a lot more than others the importer had received, he said. `` The inspector ... searched intensively and found 6,000 pounds of cocaine concealed in blocks of chocolate,'' he said. `` The computer said, ` Let it go.' The person said, ` Wait a minute.'''

 The Republican designation next to a candidate's name in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> usually means an election winner, but Democrat <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> has emerged as the leading contender for the state's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat. `` In this state, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will win if all he is doing is breathing that day,'' state Sen. <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, said referring to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nominee. Only one Democratic presidential candidate, <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, has carried <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>'s win in 1936. `` This is a Republican state,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Neb </LOCATION>., the 77-year-old grand dame of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> politics `` Nebraskans' philosophy is a relatively conservative philosophy. But the 45-year-old <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON>, former governor of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, leads Republican Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> by more than 20 points in recent statewide polls, and political observers are hard-pressed when asked for clear reasons. Some cite <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON>'s record in the Vietnam War where he lost part of his leg and received the Medal of Honor. Others attribute his success to good looks and star quality; <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> attracted national attention when he dated actress Debra Winger. Still others believe <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON>'s independence from the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> makes him appealing to Nebraskans. At a recent <ORGANIZATION> Rotary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> speech, <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> was asked if he could provide one good reason, other than his party affiliation, for supporting Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` No,'' <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> replied, sending his audience into peals of laughter. He later explained to the group that he supports the Democratic ticket but that he and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> contender do n't agree on everything. `` <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> is a unique individual who personifies certain traits that Nebraskans respect,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Heineman </PERSON>, an adviser to Rep. <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Daub </PERSON>, R-Neb. `` He is uniquely different.'' To make matters worse for Republicans, <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> has encountered a series of problems since his appointment by GOP Gov. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> after the death of <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zorinsky </PERSON>. Many Republicans believed <PERSON> Daub </PERSON> deserved the appointment, and although <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> and his backers say the wounds have healed others say bad feelings still exist. `` There is a deep wound, a deep split in the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Sen. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, D-Neb., a former governor now in his second term in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> `` <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Daub </PERSON> had done his homework and carried the water for the elephants for a long time. He was entitled more to the job and then he was hit in the head with a two-by-four by the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor,'' <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Daub </PERSON> challenged <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> in a heated May primary and was favored, but <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> scored an upset win. In the one and only debate between <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate elicited boos from some in the crowd of 2,000 when he said, `` We need fewer farmers at this point in time.'' <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON>, who has an interest in a family farm in central <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and whose commercials have portrayed him as a `` farmer senator,'' later said he misspoke. `` I obviously do n't support that statement,'' he said. <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> also encountered some difficulties when he noted that the list of `` Hollywood-types'' supporting <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> include <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>, who came under attack for her wartime visit to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> angrily denied any association with <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>, saying her trip during the war hurt him and his fellow soldiers. The Democrat's staff pointed out that while <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> was earning the Medal of Honor, <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> was using college draft deferments `` I have not gone through <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON>' campaign list and said ` Gee, you're going to be beholden to <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> because he holds a fund-raiser for you,'' <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> said. `` It's just old politics and the anger that I feel toward <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> is that I and a lot of other <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> vets suffered as a result of her actions. `` I understand she is connected to this political action committee, but she has made no direct contribution to me and I would n't accept it.'' <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> says his ideals are more in tune with those of the late <PERSON> Zorinsky </PERSON> than are <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON>'s. `` <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zorinsky </PERSON> was a conservative. He voted a number of times with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. That's why he was popular. It was n't because he dated a movie star,'' <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> said.

 A federal judge today delayed indefinitely the arraignment of <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> on racketeering charges, but ordered the wife of the deposed <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> president to appear in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Monday. `` I am adjourning sine die -LRB- without date -RRB- the arraignment of President <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> after defense lawyers presented him with doctors' letters saying <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was too ill to travel the 5,000 miles from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> refused to delay the arraignment of <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who, like her 71-year-old husband, was indicted last week for an alleged scheme that looted their homeland's treasury of more than $ 100 million. `` I see no reason at all to delay her arraignment,'' said <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>, despite pleas from <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON> about the lengthy flight to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, where the Marcoses have lived since fleeing the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> in February 1986. The Marcoses were indicted Friday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, lawyers had said a private jet owned by a tobacco heiress was at the ready to fly <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> if the arraignment was to be held there. <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, 74, who owns a mansion in the exclusive <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> ocean-front neighborhood of <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, had agreed to lend <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> her specially equipped <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-300 if federal officials rejected his lawyers' request to move Monday's arraignment from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` We have asked Mrs. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> for the use of her plane and she graciously agreed,'' said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartko </PERSON>. `` The government knows that, we had to tell them what arrangements were being made.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> lawyers contend the 71-year-old <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is too frail to make the trip for such a simple proceeding. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is prohibited by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> from leaving the island of <LOCATION> Oahu </LOCATION> without filing a written application.

 The city's legal director, jailed on contempt of court charges, says <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> officials broke no laws in spending $ 42.1 million to assist in an industrial development project. <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> this week ordered Corporation Counsel <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Pailen </PERSON> held indefinitely in the county jail after <PERSON> Pailen </PERSON> refused to supply The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> with public records related to its 1987 purchase of 15 acres of riverfront property for construction of a <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> assembly plant. But Mayor <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> A.

And I'm proud of him. The principle here is how much license does the press have to destroy people's reputations That's why <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Pailen </PERSON> is in jail.'' Other city officials had joined <PERSON> Pailen </PERSON> in arguing that the documents should be withheld while a federal grand jury investigated the transaction. `` We, of course, take the position that there is no criminal wrongdoing associated with anything related to this deal,'' <PERSON> Pailen </PERSON> said Tuesday after calling a WXYT-AM talk-show host collect from his cell. `` In this case, the grand jury convened to look into this issue. They should be the ones to determine the truth of the matter,'' he said. `` This is not a situation in our view that should be dealt with and tried on the front page of the press.'' <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> officials have asked the <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to stay <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>'s order to release the documents and to stay the judge's decision to hold <LOCATION> Pailen </LOCATION> in civil contempt of court The court had not acted on those requests by Wednesday afternoon, clerk <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohmetscher </PERSON> said. `` I make no apologies -LRB- and -RRB- no excuses'' for refusing to release the documents, <PERSON> Pailen </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> WXYT </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is my principle of law, and I think it's one the courts will ultimately have to recognize as having validity. Until that happens, I'm content to be here.'' Pailen is segregated from other inmates in the 1,551-bed facility and has been conducting limited office work, officials said.

<HEAD>Government Marijuana Arrives For Glaucoma Victim</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A woman nearly blinded by glaucoma is happily puffing on her first shipment of government-grown marijuana _ a drug federal officials took months to approve for her medical use. `` This is going to mean I'm not going to wonder where my next dosage of medication is going to come from,'' said <PERSON> Elvy </PERSON> <PERSON> Musikka </PERSON> at a Wednesday press conference to announce the government's decision. Ms. <PERSON> Musikka </PERSON>, 44, was tried in August on charges of growing marijuana plants in her back yard. She and her physician successfully argued that using the drug was the only way to relieve glaucoma's pressure on her eyes. After her arrest eight months ago, she applied to the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> for a federal program to receive pot legally for medical treatments. Ms. <PERSON> Musikka </PERSON>, who is already blind in her right eye, said she was slowly losing the remaining sight in her left eye waiting for her application to be processed. Her first monthly supply of 300 free marijuana cigarettes arrived at the <ORGANIZATION> Bascom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eye </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Friday, Ms. <PERSON> Musikka </PERSON> said. She now carries a brown plastic container for her marijuana cigarettes. She is said to be only the third person in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> given permission to smoke the drug legally for medical reasons. Ms. <PERSON> Musikka </PERSON> hopes the marijuana will save the 10 percent eyesight she has left. `` Ten percent is not much,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Musikka </PERSON>, who says she had smoked marijuana for 12 years before her arrest. `` But that's a whole lot better than none at all. When your vision is gone, it ca n't be replaced.'' She can use the marijuana anywhere tobacco smoking is permitted, said her attorney <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>. At the news conference, <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> lauded the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION>, each of which had to approve Ms. <PERSON> Musikka </PERSON>'s application for marijuana.

<TEXT>
 Five Palestinians shouted `` Revolution Until Victory'' today after they were sentenced to hang for terrorist attacks that killed five Britons and two Sudanese. Judge <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bashir </PERSON> pronounced the five guilty of murder in the bombing of a hotel and a gun attack on a social club, both of which occurred in May. The attacks also injured 20 people, including three Americans. The five British deaths included a family of four. No date was set for the five to hang. <PERSON> Jalal </PERSON> <PERSON> Aly </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutfy </PERSON>, the chief defense lawyer, said he would file an appeal within the required 40 days. Court records identified the Palestinians as <PERSON> Imad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Huello </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimir </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> <PERSON> Ismat </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Arif </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>. The sentencing hearing had been postponed four times. After the third postponement Oct. 17, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> expressed concern over reports in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> terrorist whose group has been linked to many terror attacks, was trying to buy lenient treatment for the accused in exchange for money to help flood victims. Sudanese security sources said in May that two of the convicted men told investigators they were members of <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s group. The sources quoted the two men as saying the attacks were meant to avenge the assassination of <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, or <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION>, a close adviser to <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> was killed at his home earlier this year in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, by commandos which <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and other sources linked to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> intelligence. However, Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> issued a statement Wednesday saying he believed the five have no connection with Palestinian organizations. `` This is because the only profiting side from such acts which were committed by the said element is the Zionist entity,'' or <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, he said without elaborating.

 <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the longest-held foreign hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, turned 41 today and spent a fourth consecutive birthday in captivity. Pro-Iranian militants holding him again denied any links to a woman who was arrested in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> carrying a photograph of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist. The statement by Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, was delivered to a Western news agency and accompanied by an old photo of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. The statement did not provide any information on <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> or another <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> the group is holding, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>. It was devoted to denying links to the Lebanese woman, <PERSON> Aline </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizkallah </PERSON>, 36, who was arrested at <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> airport last week. A photograph of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, another <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hostage, <PERSON> Alann </PERSON> <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>, and a third picture of an unidentified man were found in her luggage along with a letter purportedly from <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>. Police in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> said today the letter appears to be a fake. They say the photos and the letter were supposed to go to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> organization through an Italian arms dealer. Police said the woman also was carrying heroin. Another underground faction, called the Islamic Jihad for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> has claimed <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>'s abduction. But Western and Lebanese intelligence services say the two groups are linked, operating under the umbrella of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s main proxy force in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> The Italian police and reporters who saw the pictures found with Ms. <PERSON> Rizkallah </PERSON> have said <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s picture appeared to be a reproduction of an old one released by the kidnappers in 1987. That of <PERSON> Steen </PERSON> apparently was taken off a video tape his captors had released of him. Today's statement by <PERSON> Islamic </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON> said her photo of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> was a `` reverse print'' of a one they released on Aug. 2, 1987. The group has issued 13 photographs of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> since his abduction March 16, 1985. He is the longest-held of the 14 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The statement was 22 lines long. It was typewritten in Arabic. To prove its theory of the reproduced photograph, the envelope contained an original copy of the old photograph of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and a photocopy of a reproduction. The reproduction looked identical to what was found with Ms. <PERSON> Rizkallah </PERSON>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, wearing a bushy beard, appeared in the original photograph looking straight into the camera with the head slightly inclined to the right. In the reproduction, the head appeared inclined to the left. `` The Italian government is held responsible for publishing all the details about this case. It is also accused of complicity with the so-called <PERSON> Aline </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizkallah </PERSON> in coordination with the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and American intelligence services until proven otherwise,'' the statement said. `` We renew our warning to all local and foreign -LRB- news -RRB- agencies against manipulating and trading with the photographs and documents which we attach to our statements and which we hope they will be published in full in line with journalistic honesty,'' the statement added. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, is chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, 57, a native of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Collins </LOCATION>, Col., is acting dean of agriculture at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION>. In its statement on Monday, <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION> denied links with Ms. <PERSON> Rizkallah </PERSON> and claimed she was connected with the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> secret service.

 A Playboy magazine photographer will not be allowed to screen <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> students for a `` Women of the Big East'' pictorial at either the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> college or a <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> hotel, officials said. Photographer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecey </PERSON> had planned to meet with <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> students for part of a <LOCATION> Big </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> athletic conference layout scheduled for the April 1989 issue, <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowitz </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mecey </PERSON>, who planned to stay in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> from Wednesday through Friday, intended to interview and photograph women in various locations, including the <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inn </ORGANIZATION> where he had a reservation. The planned feature would include nude and semi-nude photos. The hotel's name and number were listed on a <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> leaflet and in a quarter-page advertisement to appear in today's edition of The NewPaper, said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumbore </PERSON>, an employee at the weekly alternative newspaper. But <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, the hotel's resident manager, said that when officials realized Wednesday morning who <PERSON> Mecey </PERSON> was, they decided not to allow him to conduct business at the hotel. <PERSON> Mecey </PERSON> was told by hotel officials when he arrived Wednesday night that he could not conduct interviews on hotel property. `` If he wants to stay here, he can. He has rented a room and we are in the business of renting rooms,'' said general manager <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Neidhart </PERSON>. `` But he did not have our authorization to use our name in any advertisements, and he can not interview or photograph in the hotel.'' `` I'm not entirely taken aback, but I think that's pretty drastic,'' said <PERSON> Rakowitz </PERSON> when informed of the <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION>'s decision. `` That's sort of eliminating the rights of the individual to make a freedom of choice _ but a hotel is private property.'' Playboy also was banned from interviewing or staying at the <LOCATION> Sheraton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tara </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Braintree </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, when it interviews <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> students in mid-November, said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION>'s managing photo editor. Some people who arrived at the <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> looking for Mecey were escorted off hotel property by security guards, said <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>. He said several people, both women and men, were removed from the lobby and floors. Playboy had decided against seeking the cooperation of administrators at any of the schools it will visit, deciding instead to advertise off-campus and in college newspapers. Playboy had hoped to run an ad in the Cowl, the student newspaper at the 3,800-student college, but students and administrators decided against it, said a school spokesman, the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McGreevy </PERSON>. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, another <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> school, decided earlier this month against running an article about the Playboy feature in its student newspaper. `` I'm still confident that we will recruit our women,'' said <PERSON> Rakowitz </PERSON>, who said about 20 women were wanted for the feature. `` I've never come into a problem at a hotel. I think it's sort of repressing.'' Other schools in the Big East Conference are <ORGANIZATION> Villanova </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Villanova </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Seton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>; and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 The death of an unidentified man has pushed the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s 1988 homicide rate to within one of the city's all-time total, a police spokesman said today. The victim found shot to death Wednesday night was the city's 286th reported homicide since Jan. 1, 1988, said police officer <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> The highest homicide total, 287, was recorded in 1969. There were 227 homicides in the district last year. Police attributed the increase to violent turf battles by drug dealers in the city. Authorities estimate that 60 percent of this year's killings have been drug-related, compared to 1987 when 33 percent of the homicides involved drugs. It was not known if the most recent slaying was drug-related, <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> said. `` We do n't have organized crime in this city, so we have a lot of young entrepreneurs fighting for turf,'' Police Chief <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said Wednesday during a news conference on the homicide rate.

 Heeding arguments by Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is vetoing a `` whistleblower'' bill to protect government workers who report wrongdoing. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> contends the measure, approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> without a single dissenting vote, has constitutional problems and would interfere with legitimate discipline of employees, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Loye </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said today. The president said Wednesday he will exercise his `` pocket veto'' power of killing a bill by refusing to sign it while <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is not in session. It had passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> by 418-0 and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by a unanimous voice vote. The measure would have given major new protections to federal workers who expose fraud and mismanagement. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said it would have allowed employees `` who are not genuine whistleblowers'' to manipulate the process to delay or avoid proper discipline. `` I regret that the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did not present me with constitutional and effective legislation to expand the protections and procedural rights afforded to federal employees who report fraud, waste and abuse they discover in federal programs,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s memorandum said `` The interests of both employees and managers should be fully protected,'' the president said. He pledged to submit his own bill in January when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> returns. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> under both <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and his predecessor, <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, has consistently opposed the bill, said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s spokesman. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> presented the department's case at a White House meeting Wednesday. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, in a statement released by his office, said that while the bill `` contains some worthwhile elements, some of which we would urge be introduced next session, it also contained elements which would violate provisions of our constitution. `` The bill would have resulted in the executive branch filing suit in federal court against itself. This it can not do, just as no person can file suit against himself,'' said <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Government Operations, said he was surprised by the veto because he had only agreed to bring the bill to a floor vote after the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had given its approval. But the administration `` reneged on what was agreed to,'' <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. Sponsors said the whistleblower bill was needed because the Office of Special Counsel, established to represent the interests of whistleblowers, was not doing its job. The bill was designed to reverse decisions of courts and the <ORGANIZATION> Merit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, a federal judicial agency, that made it difficult for whistleblowers to win their cases. The bill would have made the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Counsel </ORGANIZATION> an independent agency and would have defined its role clearly as one of protecting whistleblowers. The office now is part of the <ORGANIZATION> Merit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and at times it has acted against whistleblowers who came to the office for help. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he opposed provisions in the bill that would have altered the burden of proof in whistleblower cases. The measure would have required an employee to show only that the agency's knowledge of the whistleblowing was a factor in his or her punishment, rather than a `` significant'' or `` dominant'' factor as required under current law Agencies also would have had to show by `` clear and convincing evidence'' that the same disciplinary decision would have occurred in the absence of any whistleblowing. The change `` essentially rigs the board's process against agency personnel managers in favor of employees,'' the president said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also said the bill would have caused constitutional problems because it would have allowed executive branch agencies to go to court against each other. The president has the power to resolve disputes between his subordinates, he said. However, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON>, legal director of the Government Accountability Project nonprofit group, said the veto `` is equivalent to endorsing continued reprisals against whistleblowers who challenge bureaucratic abuses. This issue is n't going to go away. ... We'll be back next year arguing for a stronger whistleblower protection law and we'll win.'' <PERSON> Devine </PERSON>, whose group provides aid to whistleblowers, said there was precedent for federal agencies to challenge executive branch decisions. He said the bill would have imposed whistleblower standards that now are in use in private industry. `` Those same legal burdens have n't interfered with private industry's ability to fire incompetent workers,'' <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> said.

 Democrat presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> declared today that `` this election is up for grabs'' and ridiculed Republican rival <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s assertion that his proposal for cutting the capital gains tax would create new jobs. `` Who's he kidding?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> asked supporters in this <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb. `` What are they going to do with the extra money? Hire a second butler, a lifeguard for the pool?'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan to reduce the top capital gains tax rate from 33 percent to 15 percent was not a jobs program but a huge tax break for the vice president and his wealthy friends. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says it would spur business investment and generate new jobs. `` It's Halloween come early,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` A treat for the wealthiest 1 percent and a trick for the rest of us.'' One day after the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee touted his tax plan before <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> business leaders, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> really was proposing to `` give the the people at the top the money and hope the crumbs fall off for the rest of us.'' He also rebuked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vice presidential running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, for opposing legislation that would require employers to give workers 60 days' notice of mass layoffs or plant closings. The Democratic nominee, struggling to reverse his slide in the polls in the nation's industrial heartland, cloaked himself in the memory of <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>'s upset victory over Republican <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> in 1948. `` <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> was a fighter and so am I,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` My friends, this election is up for grabs.'' From Evergreen Park, he headed for <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and was ending the day with a town meeting in Independence, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>'s birthplace. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also was appearing on the CBS Evening News tonight. At a town meeting Monday night in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Naperaville </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delivered a broad swipe Monday at what he called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nasty campaigning and distortions of his positions on defense, the environment, crime and gun controls. The session was broadcast nationally on the C-SPAN cable TV network. `` This is not a campaign about furloughs and flag factories,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said at a high school in this <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb. `` This is a campaign about the future of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. And especially about young people.'' He also sought to lay claim to the high ground in the campaign, a position <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> hopes will sway undecided and soft <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporters in the 12 days before the election. `` I do n't think politics ought to be an enterprise in which all we do is cut the other guy up,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Obviously, Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> disagrees. I think it's a disservice to the American people.'' The latest statewide survey in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s late August nine-point lead cut to one as the vice president led <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 44-43 percent, according to today's editions of The <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. The survey of 550 likely voters, conducted Sunday and Monday, had a margin of error of plus or minus four points. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has blamed his slide in national polls on a litany of unfounded GOP allegations left unanswered, but his audience in <LOCATION> Naperville </LOCATION> and three other cities asked questions that allowed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to respond to the salvos. In addition to the C-Span broadcast, the session was shown simultaneously at meetings in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Johnstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>. At the <LOCATION> Naperville </LOCATION> forum, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ad showing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> riding in an Army tank misrepresented his position on several weapons systems and also accused the vice president of proving he lacked leaderhip credentials by failing to outline weapons systems he would select at a time when both candidates project stable defense spending `` Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has never met a weapons system he did n't like,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. In an interview with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, published in today's editions, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> conceded that he may have erred at the Democratic National Convention when he said, `` this campaign is not about ideology _ it's about competence. The Democratic nominee said that he might have used his first speech to a national audience to lay out `` values and philosophy ... fundamental differences between me and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' `` Should the speech in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> have been more explicit, more of a statement of philosophy, positions?'' he said. `` Perhaps.'' At a rowdy noontime rally Wednesday in <LOCATION> Pueblo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also accused the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of distoring his position on gun control. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he supported the rights of hunters and sportsmen to own guns and for homeowners to purchase guns to protect their homes. He then chided <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for not taking a position on legislation to provide a seven-day waiting period to allow police to conduct background checks before approving gun sales.

<HEAD>Jury Out in Case of Father Whose Son Died for Lack of Medical

 The jury is deliberating in the manslaughter trial of a faith-healing church deacon, branded by a prosecutor as `` a fanatic'' for failing to seek medical treatment before his 10-year-old diabetic son died. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Da </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>, 43, is charged with first-degree manslaughter for failing to get treatment for his son, <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON>, who died Dec. 20 of untreated juvenile diabetes. A similar charge against his wife, <PERSON> Judith </PERSON>, was dropped before the case went to trial. The Normans were members of a nameless Christian sect that rejected conventional medicine, demanded strict discipline of children and adults and viewed its leaders as prophets. Jurors got the case late Wednesday and deliberated about 3 -LCB- hours before being sent home for the night. They were to resume their work later today. In closing arguments Wednesday, deputy <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Colwell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>, a deacon in the sect, `` got wrapped up in this, just like the rest of them. He became a fanatic, just like the rest of them.'' A parent has a duty to provide medical care for a dependent child, and <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> recklessly failed to meet that obligation, <PERSON> Colwell </PERSON> said. Defense lawyer <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Peven </PERSON> argued that <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s religious fervor blinded him to the danger his son faced. <PERSON> Peven </PERSON> said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> was steeped in fellowship teachings for seven years and was unable to break free of that doctrine in the four days his son's illness became apparent. Spanking the boy the day before he died, ostensibly to get him to confess to some sin that sect leaders believed was making him ill, exacerbated the juvenile diabetes that made him look `` like a concentration camp victim,'' <PERSON> Colwell </PERSON> said. `` We've all experienced different kinds of discipline in our lives ... but this was outside the bounds of any reasonable case,'' he said. `` This was a sick child. This was a child who was dying.'' <PERSON> Peven </PERSON> conceded that the boy died of diabetes, that he would have lived if medical treatment had been sought and that <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> failed to seek medical treatment. Sect leaders, including founder <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleber </PERSON>, who helped spank <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> during a confrontive questioning session the day before he died, exerted tremendous influence over members' lives, <PERSON> Peven </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kleber </PERSON> and former <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> pastor <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, both 34, pleaded guilty earlier to second-degree criminal mistreatment. Three other former elders of the fellowship, which disbanded shortly after the boy died, face trial on similar charges next year.

<HEAD>Drug Company Official Says Distribution Could Resume</HEAD>

parties and anti-abortion groups. TRIMS to tighten. No pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An official of the French pharmaceutical company that suspended distribution of the abortion pill RU 486 said today the pill could become available again if public opposition to it subsides. A communique issued by the company Wednesday said distribution of the drug worldwide was stopped in response to an `` outcry of public opinion at home and abroad.'' The story was front-page news in <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> newspapers. The company's decision to suspend distribution was hailed by two anti-abortion groups in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> but criticized by government. <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Andre </PERSON>, the Cabinet minister responsible for women's rights, told a news conference the drug company's decision was a `` disagreable blow. `` I think that all of a sudden this company gave in to pressure from a large number of people,'' she said. `` Often questions involving morals and women bring about a backlash.'' She indicated she would contact the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> to see what could be done about getting other pharmaceutical companies to produce the drug. <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Joly </PERSON>, vice president of the pharmaceutical company that makes the pill, <ORGANIZATION> Roussel-Uclaf </ORGANIZATION>, said today on French radio, `` We could resume distribution of RU 486 if the atmosphere returns to normal.'' <PERSON> Joly </PERSON> denied reports the company halted distribution because it feared a threatened boycott of its other products. `` A boycott could only be carried out by doctors who have to put the interests of their patients above everything else,'' he said. When the French government last month authorized use of the anti-hormone substance in registered abortion clinics, <PERSON> Joly </PERSON> said a controversy developed. `` Public opinion was unleashed. We witnessed an orchestrated campaign that grew in strength,'' he said, referring to anti-abortion groups in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. One French anti-abortion group, the Committee To Save Infants to be Born, called for the `` destruction of all the stocks of this chemical weapon RU486.'' Another, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>, said the decision to halt distribution was a `` great victory for women and for families who mobilized to bring about suppression of the drug and everyday acceptance of abortion in favor of pro-life measures.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> parties protested the decision. The Socialists denounced the company's action as a `` new attack on the freedom of women to choose a new medical method.'' The statement said the Socialists, who lead the present French government, were astonished at the move, announced one month after the Ministry of Health authorized the drug. The <ORGANIZATION> Marseille </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Provencal </ORGANIZATION> said in an editorial that when the pill was invented the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> welcomed it, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was enthusiastic and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said it met all medical specifications. `` It is true that the religious authorities and the right-to-life groups were shocked by this progress,'' the paper said. `` But all the same, are we going to be without a voice when confronted with these fundamentalist manifestations of faith against science and against the law?'' The company's decision was hailed by Cardinal <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Decourtray </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> conference of bishops. At the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, which authorized prescription of the drug Sept. 23 subject to strict medical supervision, an official said the decision `` makes one wonder about who's in charge'' at <ORGANIZATION> Roussel-Uclaf </ORGANIZATION>. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he regretted that the company decided to stop distribution after all the research, medical trials and other steps necessary to get the pill to the market. He said he was surprised by the reasons the company gave because `` in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, anyway, the protests were pretty weak and did not lead to either catastrophe or strong feelings. The company acted to preserve its image abroad.'' The official said the government could not reverse the decision because it was a minority shareholder in the Paris-based company. The majority shareholder is the West German chemical group <ORGANIZATION> Hoechst </ORGANIZATION>. The pill, also known as Mifepristone, is an anti-hormone that acts by blocking the action of progesterone, a hormone essential in all phases of pregnancy. Researchers say it is highly effective in the first seven weeks of pregnancy, particularly when used in conjunction with a second product called Sulprotone, or prostaglandine E. The new drug is not a do-it-yourself morning after pill that can be purchased at the supermarket and taken at home. It must be used under medical supervision.

 Sen <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said today that Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has tried to keep his ideology from the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people in a `` cynical political move.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, addressing a breakfast of several hundred supporters at the Grove Park Inn resort, said the Republicans are `` the party of the future ... we're the ones that are out there talking about ideas.'' Recalling <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' statement at the Democratic convention that the election is about competence rather than ideas, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` I can tell you ideology is important. Ideas are important, and to think you can fool the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people by not talking about ideology was a cynical political move that will not work.'' Keeping up the Republican strategy of portraying the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor as a liberal who is out of step with mainstream <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` Liberalism is a philosophy of the past. It is a philosophy that failed.'' On another subject, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said to reporters in <LOCATION> Asheville </LOCATION> that homelessness in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is not due to a lack of low-income housing. `` I would guess that there's adequate low-income housing in the country today but that does n't mean that is the only answer or the solution to the problem. That's one of them, and if we can find out it is not adequate low-income housing we'll have to see what we can do about it,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` It's a problem that we're going to have to identify. First, who are the homeless? What are their needs? Are they on the streets because they do n't have adequate housing?'' He added, `` I bet you will find maybe in some cases that there is some housing. Are there some volunteer shelters that can be used?'' Later, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was heading to <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> for a rally at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>, and then traveling to campaign stops in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. A day earlier, in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> noted the recent frequent television appearances by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Democratic running mate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. `` Actually I think it's their swan song,'' he said, talking to reporters as he left a fund-raising event. `` A nice way for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to say goodbye to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` I think Sen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has a different agenda. He's been very good at pumping himself up. He has n't been too good at pumping up <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. As a matter of fact he talks more about himself than he does the top of the ticket. I do n't blame him.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> made the comments as a new <ORGANIZATION> CBS-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with a 13-point lead over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. A <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> an 11-point lead in the critical state of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also stumped in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> district on Wednesday and he was enthusiastically received at a rally of about 400 Cuban-Americans. He told them that being in the Cuban community, `` I have been able to feel the spirit of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' He said he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` will invest in our people, quality education, job opportunity, family, neighborhood and, yes, a thing we call <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. A thing we call <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> because this country is still the beacon of hope for millions around the world.'' Earlier, at <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciccone </PERSON> said has a high dropout rate and a 90-percent Hispanic student body, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> promised that a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would make sure anyone who wants to has the opportunity to go to college. Answering a question on immigration, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told the students: `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will always have an open door policy ... We all are from somewhere.'' He told them his own ancestors were from the Isle of Man. In his home state of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected on Wednesday two requests to open his application to the bar. A <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> attorney and The Indianapolis News had made separate requests for the application under the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION>. The application contains several questions asking whether the applicant has been dishonest or had academic difficulties. <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulvaney </PERSON> said the court cited a provision allowing exemption of records `` declared confidential by or under rules adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> court </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>.''

 Soviet officials said today they will start liquidating unprofitable businesses and farms to bolster the nation's economy and overcome a budget deficit expected to reach $ 58 billion next year. `` A number of enterprises are on the brink of being eliminated,'' Finance Minister <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gostev </PERSON> told the 1,500 deputies of the Supreme Soviet legislature. They gathered today at the Grand Kremlin Palace in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for a two-day session on a 1989 development plan and $ 804 billion government budget. <PERSON> Gostev </PERSON>, who presented the deficit budget to the lawmakers, admitted the government of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is finding it difficult to bring deficit spending under control. The overspending began in previous Soviet regimes. He said the deficit `` is a problem that has not emerged just now, but is a result of the unbalanced economy, of the policy of extensive subsidizing, and huge losses _ of all that was brought about by extensive methods of economic management, parasitic attitudes and a passive financial policy.'' The economic report presented to the deputies painted a gloomy picture of Soviet life with cramped housing, food rotting en route to stores, jammed trains during vacation periods, and massive amounts of new equipment lying unused on factory floors. However, the 1989 plan promised dramatic improvements in what <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Maslyukov </PERSON>, head the state planning committee, acknowledged was a response to criticism in the press and legislature. He said central planning will be slashed by restraining what ministries can do. This year, the state bought and redistributed 86 percent of production, but it will buy just 25 percent next year. Everything else must be sold on a new open market according to consumer demand. `` The state will cease to be the sole distributor of resources,'' <PERSON> Maslyukov </PERSON> said. In another bow to public pressure, he listed several development plans dropped due to environmental concerns, including two-thirds of 50 planned water projects. <PERSON> Gostev </PERSON> promised that pensions and payments to low-income families will rise and that planned price reform will not lower the standard of living. The new emphasis under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on consumer goods and the standard of living mark a major turnaround in Communist policy.

The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> budget carries a deficit of about $ 100 billion. The 1989 draft budget, which is customarily approved by the Supreme Soviet in a unanimous vote, also allocates $ 32.8 billion to the country's armed forces, the same amount as in 1988, <PERSON> Gostev </PERSON> said. However, Western experts say the Soviet military budget is many times that figure, because the armed forces also receive money allocated for science, industry and other purposes. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> estimates that the Soviet military budget is actually 15 percent of the nation's total economy.

<TEXT>
 The government will give to its <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> a radar station that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> contends is in violation of the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, a Soviet spokesman said today. <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, also said the government has offered to eliminate radar at two other sites, both of which have been challenged by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. However, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said the moves do not constitute an admission the radar equipment violates the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. The pact bars the two superpowers from developing new defenses against missiles. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has rejected anything short of dismantling the giant radar station at <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION>, which <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said will instead be given to the Academy of Sciences. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> says such facilities must be located on the periphery of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, not in the interior. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> previously offered to turn over it over to a civilian agency. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said it will be turned into an international center for the study of space, as promised. He also said today the Kremlin was acting on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> complaints about two other radar sites. `` We meant to use those elements for economic purposes, which is not against the clauses of the ABM treaty,'' he said at today's briefing for Soviet and foreign reporters `` Being guided by the interests of preservation and strengthening the ABM treaty, we are prepared to make another constructive step in that regard; that is to eliminate the radar elements of Flat Twin and Pawn Shop in the regions of <LOCATION> Gomel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>,'' he said. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report in December 1987 charged the locations of Flat Twin and Pawn Shop fall outside a permitted deployment area or test range under the treaty. Asked later what he meant by the offer to eliminate the radar components, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said, `` Eliminate them physically.'' The spokesman repeated a call on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to take similar measures with two radar sites the Soviets contend violate the treaty, one in <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> and one under construction in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and its far-right rivals claimed success today in white municipal elections, but Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said a boycott of separate black voting succeeded. Only a tiny fraction of the country's 26 million blacks voted in Wednesday's segregated elections, which the white government described as the most significant extension of democracy in South African history. An estimated one third of 1.5 million registered blacks came to the polls. `` Manipulate statistics whichever way you like,'' said <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, who advocated an election boycott. `` The reality remains that black South Africans reject apartheid and government attempts to give it a coat of new paint,'' said the winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the predominant blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate muncipal councils, schools and health services. The far-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, campaigning for stricter enforcement of apartheid laws, had predicted victory in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, the country's administrative capital. It narrowly missed its goal, winning 19 council seats to 22 for the Nationalists. It also fell short of its targets in the <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, the most rural of four provinces. But the Conservatives swept to power in farming and industrial towns of <LOCATION> Transvaal </LOCATION>, the most populous province, where they won at least 67 of 105 municipalities. The Nationalists for the first time gained outright control in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, the nation's largest city, but the Conservatives also won seats on the council for the first time. Both the Conservatives and Nationalists said the results boded well for their prospects in a general election, expected by early 1990. These were the first nationwide municipal elections contested by the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which was established in 1980 by disenchanted Nationalists. The elections also were the first in which South Africans of all races voted on the same day. A total of 7,229 seats were contested, most of them in white communities. Of the 1,839 seats available on black councils, only 905 had more than one candidate. The white government declared itself satisfied with black turnout and said some of the elected blacks might be asked to negotiate on national issues. Blacks normally have no say at the national level. `` A significant percentage -LRB- of blacks -RRB- voted for peaceful evolutionary change,'' said Constitutional Development Minister <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON>. State-run Radio <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> estimated the black voter turnout at about one-third nationwide. That would mean over 400,000 blacks cast votes, compared to just under 300,000 in the last black municipal elections in 1983. However, the population increased about 15 percent since then, indicating only a minimal increase in black voter turnout. The black tournout ranged as high as 80 percent in some small rural towns, but it was 11.5 percent in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, the largest black community. In many townships, there were no candidates or the number of blacks eligible to vote was so low that the voting represented only a fraction of the population. In <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, the votes cast represented 2.8 percent of adult residents. `` I see they -LRB- the government -RRB- are claiming today that hundreds of thousands have voted and that the people elected have a solid mandate,'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said at today's news conference. `` How can there be a solid mandate when half the seats for blacks were not even contested for the lack of interest? How does a 10 or 12 percentage poll in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> constitute a solid mandate?'' Government-run television said 25 percent of black registered voters in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> province cast ballots, 33 percent in <LOCATION> Transvaal </LOCATION>, 46 percent in the <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and 29 percent in <LOCATION> Natal </LOCATION>. Anti-apartheid activists, including many prominent clergymen, said voting for separate local authorities represents an entrenchment of the system of racial segregation. In the white elections, anti-apartheid candidates kept control of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>.

 Two men were convicted Thursday of hijacking a jetliner with 118 people aboard from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> in May, and they were sentenced to 3 -LCB- years in prison. <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching-kuo </PERSON> said he and fellow hijacker <PERSON> Lung </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuei-yun </PERSON> will appeal their conviction to the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> High Court because `` anti-communist defectors should not be guilty.'' <PERSON> Chang </PERSON>, 27, told the court he and Lung, 26, hijacked the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s state-run <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on May 12 to defect to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, stronghold of the rival Nationalist Chinese government. He said they had not intended to harm the passengers. The hijackers appeared surprised at the sentence because prosecutors had urged leniency for the `` freedom-seekers.'' They could have been sentenced to death. They used a toy gun and fake explosives to force the pilot to fly to an air base in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> shortly after the jetliner took off on a domestic flight from <LOCATION> Xiamen </LOCATION>, across the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The fall of a 16-ton steel sculpture that pinned two art gallery workers to the floor, crushing one man's leg, was the second accident involving one of artist <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Serra </PERSON>'s massive and sometimes controversial works. The accident Wednesday at the <ORGANIZATION> Leo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Castelli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gallery </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Soho </LOCATION> occurred as the workers were removing the piece, `` Reading Cones,'' after an exhibition. A set of heavy-duty jacks collapsed and dropped the artwork in the first-floor gallery, said <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Efrain </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrilla </PERSON>. In the early 1970s, a worker in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> was killed when part of a Serra sculpture collapsed. At the <ORGANIZATION> Castelli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gallery </ORGANIZATION>, the sculpture knocked down two of nine cast-iron structural support columns in the five-story loft building. The building was evacuated for the remainder of the day while city inspectors assessed the damage. Police officers were able to free one of the workers, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hafner </PERSON>, almost immediately. But <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON>, 30, was pinned for three to six minutes, police said. Surgeons were unable to save <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON>'s right leg, which was amputated below the knee, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Bellevue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> administrator, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, who said <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> was admitted in serious but stable condition. <PERSON> Hafner </PERSON>, in his 30s, was taken to <LOCATION> Beekman-Downtown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> complaining of shoulder and leg injuries, and was treated and released, said a hospital spokeswoman, <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Flatley </PERSON>. A spokeswoman for the gallery, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Brundage </PERSON>, said the sculpture was being placed in storage following a show. The curved piece of steel is 3 inches thick, 14 feet high, 17 feet long and weighs 32,000 pounds, she said. It was one of two identical pieces by <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> at the gallery, she said. The two combined are priced at $ 200,000. Another Serra sculpture, `` Tilted Arc,'' has been the center of controversy at a federal building in lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. Critics, including more than 1,000 government employees who signed a petition, want it moved. They say the 12-foot-high, 112-foot-long, rusting curve of metal obstructs views, sunlight and traffic flow. In the early 1970s, a worker was killed while helping install a two-piece <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> sculpture at the <ORGANIZATION> Walker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. One of the sculpture's steel plates fell over. In a subsequent lawsuit, the jury found that the fault was with the steel fabricator, for poor technique in making the piece, and with the rigger for failing to follow instructions. <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> and the art center were absolved of any blame.

 <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> executive director <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON> today ordered the head of the Columbus chapter to retract an endorsement of Republican presidential candidate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or face immediate suspension.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> renewed his attack today on <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan to reduce capital gains taxes, suggesting it would merely help the rich `` hire a second butler.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> accepted the endorsement of a maritime union and praised <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet teams that worked to free two ice-trapped whales. Campaigning less than two weeks before Election Day _ and four days before <LOCATION> Halloween </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said today in <LOCATION> Evergreen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s tax plan was like `` Halloween come early _ a treat for the wealthiest one percent and a trick for the rest of us.'' The plan, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, would `` give the people at the top the money and hope the crumbs fall off for the rest of us.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed reducing the top tax rate from 33 percent to 15 percent for capital gains, such as profits from sales of stocks, bonds or real estate. The Republican presidential nominee has defended his plan as a potential boon to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy, contending people benefiting from the tax reduction would then increase their investing. `` Who's he kidding?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> asked supporters in <LOCATION> Evergreen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, a suburb of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` What are they going to do with the extra money? Hire a second butler, a lifeguard for the pool?'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, spaking at a rally in <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, said today, `` This election is all about creating jobs and opportunity,'' and he said his administration would be committed to keeping the economic expansion going. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> received the endorsement of the 50,000-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beneficial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> at a rally where four protesters were pulled from the hall and more than a hundred demonstrators paraded outside. Campaigning on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, where environmental issues are always important, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expressed gratitude to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Soviet teams who worked to free the two whales trapped by ice off the coast of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. `` Every once in a while something comes along that captivates the American spirit, transcends politics, captivates the attention of the world, as a matter of fact, and emphasizes the goodness of the human race,'' he said. `` The fact that despite all of our problems we can still reach out and help, it really did move me,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, trailing in national public opinion polls, referred in his remarks to Democratic President <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>'s 1948 comeback victory. He was campaigning late in the day in <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>'s home state of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, where a statewide poll indicated that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s late August lead of nine points had dropped to one. `` <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> was a fighter and so am I,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` My friends, this election is up for grabs.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, meanwhile, was out seeking votes for his vice president. In remarks prepared for a rally in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, he noted that the Democrats have complained about negative <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> campaigning, and he said, `` On Nov. 8, go into that polling booth and do some negative campaigning of your own, the right kind of negative campaigning: Say ` no' to new taxes and ` yes' to the Republican ticket.'' Wednesday night, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> used a nationally broadcast town meeting in <LOCATION> Naperville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, to dispute <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> allegations that he is soft on crime, weak on defense, favors gun control and ignores environmental problems. The vice president, campaigning in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, and Billings, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, told voters Wednesday that the Democrats' version of prosperity is higher interest rates, similar to the 21.5 percent rate near the end of the Carter administration `` We do n't need that kind of Democratic prosperity,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` We need the kind that <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has brought to this country.'' The latest national poll by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> holding an eight-point lead over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, a somewhat smaller advantage than the double-digit margin the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee had in two polls earlier this week. The survey of 1,242 likely voters put the contest at 52-44 percent, closer than the 13-point gap in a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll and the 14 points among likely voters in a Gallup poll released Tuesday. The ABC-Post poll was conducted during the seven days ending Tuesday, and had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points. In hopes of turning the tide, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was continuing his series of television appearances with an interview tonight on the `` CBS Evening News.'' Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who appeared on the program Wednesday night, said the Republicans had run a `` miserable campaign'' of distortions which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did not address until after it hurt the ticket. `` They started immediately after that Democratic convention, and frankly I thought they should have been answered then,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` But my friend <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was incredulous, he just did n't believe that sort of charges with the distortions could stick `` But they have and they have hurt. And that's one of the reasons we're in the kind of a race we're in now.'' Republican vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, dismissed the television appearances by the Democratic ticket. `` Actually I think it's their swan song,'' he said. `` A nice way for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to say good-bye to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Reports Offer Further Evidence of Slowdown in Growth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans' personal incomes rose a moderate 0.5 percent in September while consumer spending turned in its weakest performance in almost a year, the government said Thursday in reports that offered fresh evidence that economic growth is slowing. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said personal consumption spending, which accounts for two-thirds of overall economic activity, was unchanged in September following a 0.6 percent August rise. It was the first time spending had failed to advance since a 0.2 percent drop in October 1987. That decline had been blamed in part on consumer anxiety from the record stock market plunge. When the rise in prices is taken into account, consumer spending actually fell 0.5 percent last month, the department reported. The 0.5 percent rise in incomes was also completely erased by rising inflation, it said. Analysts said the weakness in consumer spending and the modest income advance in September showed that the economy is likely to slow in coming months. `` Consumers are being more tight-fisted because their incomes are going nowhere,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> brokerage. `` They already have so much debt that they are unwilling to borrow any more.'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> predicted that consumer spending, which has been the driving force behind the current economic expansion, would show only modest gains over the coming year and that this would contribute to an expected overall economic slowdown. The government reported Wednesday that the overall economy, as measured by the gross national product, rose at an annual rate of just 2.2 percent from July through September. It was the slowest pace in almost two years and followed GNP growth of 3.2 percent in the first half of 1988. Many economists believe this slowdown will continue over the next year, with the biggest question being whether growth will become so weak that it could topple the country into a recession. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said she believed consumer spending, while slowing, would remain strong enough to support economic growth of about 2.5 percent. `` Consumer confidence remains reasonably strong. They are spending at a rate equal to their income growth. It is just that income growth has been weak,'' she said. Income rose $ 19.9 billion in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 4.1 trillion, before taking inflation into account, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. That 0.5 percent rise followed gains of 0.3 percent in August and 0.7 percent in July. Personal income was held back by a $ 6.5 billion decrease in farm income as the widespread summer drought cut output. Farm subsidy payments were unchanged. Wages and salaries, a key component of personal income, were up at an annual rate of $ 14.1 billion in September. That 0.6 percent increase followed a lackluster 0.2 percent August gain. The weakness in personal consumption spending, which was stuck at an annual rate of $ 3.26 trillion, reflected a $ 3.1 billion drop in purchases of durable goods, such as autos and appliances. Purchases of services rose $ 3.4 billion, less than one-third of the increase in August. Analysts said the services category, which includes housing costs, had been inflated in previous months by higher electricity bills because of the summer heat wave. Purchases of non-durable goods, items not expected to last three years, showed a small increase of $ 400 million. Disposable, or after-tax incomes, rose by 0.5 percent in September following a 0.3 percent August increase. Personal tax payments in September, one of four payment months for taxpayers filing quarterly returns, were up $ 3.6 billion after an increase of $ 2 billion in August. With spending showing no growth while incomes were rising, the savings rate, savings as a percentage of disposable income, climbed to 4.2 percent last month, the highest level since May. The savings rate was 3.8 percent in August. In another economic report, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the price of imported goods fell by 1.1 percent from July through September, the first such decline in more than two years. The price decrease reflected a drop in crude oil prices and the fact that the dollar strengthened somewhat against foreign currencies during the summer. A stronger dollar lowers the cost of imported goods to Americans. However, economists say the dollar will need to fall still further for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to make more progress in reducing its huge trade deficit. The price of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports, which have been booming this year, rose by 2 percent in the third quarter and are now 8.7 percent higher than they were a year ago.

 Partial returns showed President <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON>, the only candidate for the only legal party, winning more than 90 percent of the vote in <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>'s election, officials said Thursday. They said about two-thirds of the 2.6 million registered voters participated in Wednesday's election for president and members of the legislature, about the same as 1983. <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON>, 64, led the British colony of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION> to independence as <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> on Oct. 24, 1964, and has been president since, winning elections every five years as the sole candidate. He declared a one-party state in 1972. His <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> put up 609 candidates for 125 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, with 11 competing in one district. Voters were asked to vote for or against <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON>. Presidential ballots carried the symbols of an eagle and a frog. Voters chose the eagle if they were for <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON>, a frog if they were against him. Election officials said the vote for <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> was running above 90 percent with one-quarter of the votes counted. Official results are not expected until Saturday. <PERSON> Wezi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON>, the president's son, was elected to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Malambo </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> province with 5,849 votes, 4,514 more than his nearest rival. President <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> has avoided the civil disorder afflicting other African countries. He remains popular with his 7 million people despite serious economic problems caused by mismanagement, corruption and a slump in the world price of copper, which provides 90 percent of <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>'s foreign exchange. <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> is burdened by high inflation and unemployment, increasing urban crime and a $ 5 billion foreign debt that absorbs 40 percent of hard currency earnings.

<HEAD>Local Elections Leave All Sides Claiming Victory</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 All major factions, ranging from black activists to hardline white segregationists, claimed success Thursday after the country's largest and most divisive municipal elections. President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, although beaten by the far-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in dozens of white towns, triumphed in several major battlegrounds and claimed that a 33 percent turnout in contested black wards was a rebuff to activists who had urged a boycott. Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, one of the leading boycott proponents, said the government's claims were `` quite hilarious'' and noted that only a small fraction of blacks were eligible to vote. He and other anti-apartheid leaders urged the government to ignore white extremists and negotiate to give blacks full voting rights in national affairs. `` Manipulate statistics whichever way you like,'' said <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>. `` The reality remains that black South Africans reject apartheid and government attempts to give it a coat of new paint.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, campaigning for stricter enforcement of apartheid laws, fell short of some of its own bold predictions. It narrowly missed taking power in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, the adminisrative capital, where it won 19 council seats to 22 for the Nationalists, and it was beaten back in much of the range Free State, the most rural of the four provinces. But the Conservatives swept to power in farming towns and small cities of <LOCATION> Transvaal </LOCATION>, the most populous province, winning at least 67 municipalities to 30 for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The Nationalists for the first time gained outright control in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, the nation's largest city, and the Conservatives won their first seats on the council. Both the Conservatives and the Nationalists said the overall results boded well for their prospects in a general election, expected to held by early 1990. <PERSON> Andries </PERSON> <PERSON> Treurnicht </PERSON>, the Conservative leader, said his party now was in a stronger position to oppose government programs aimed at desegregating business districts and channeling more tax revenue to black areas. However, Constitutional Development Minister <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON> said the results would `` give greater momentum to the process of constitutional reform'' aimed at giving black moderates a limited role in central government. The Conservatives campaigned on many national issues over which local councils have no jurisidiciton, such as residential segregation laws. But municipal councils do have power to evict squatters and segregate public amenities. Through representation on regional councils, city councils also can influence how much of their tax money goes to help develop nearby black townships. These were the first municipal elections contested nationmwide by the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which was established in 1980 by disenchanted Nationalists who felt the government was conceding too much to blacks. The elections also were the first in which South Africans of all races voted on the same day. There were 7,229 seats at stake, most of them in white communities. Of the 1,839 seats available on black councils, only 905 had more than one candidate. The state-run South African <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> estimated the black voter turnout at about one-third of those eligible. That would amount to more than 400,000 black votes, compared with about 283,000 in the last black local elections in 1983, when a 21 percent turnout was recorded. The black turnout ranged as high as 80 percent in some small rural towns Wednesday, but was 11.5 percent in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, the largest black community, where about 28,000 of an estimated 1 million adults cast ballots. In many townships, there were no candidates. In others, there were allegations that some blacks were coerced into voting and-or induced by promises that were unable to be fulfilled. `` I see they -LRB- the government -RRB- are claiming today that hundreds of thousands have voted and that the people elected have a solid mandate,'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said in a statement. `` How can there be a solid mandate when half the seats for blacks were not even contested for the lack of interest? How does a 10 or 12 percentage poll in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> constitute a solid mandate?'' Anti-apartheid activists, including many prominent clergymen, said voting for separate local authorities was an entrenchment of the system of racial segregation. The government banned most major black anti-apartheid groups in February and outlawed calls for a vote boycott. In the white elections, anti-apartheid candidates kept control of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, although right-wingers opposed to intergation of beaches won three seats. The liberal <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> kept control of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, the country's legislative capital, and won 18 of the 51 wards in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Report: Nearly 20 Percent of U.S. Children Lack Health Insurance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nearly 20 percent of children in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have no health insurance, and youngsters in poor working families are less likely be covered than are children of the unemployed, a research group reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Employee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, in an analysis of data collected by the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, found that the higher rates of coverage for children of the unemployed occurred because it was easier for those families to qualify for Medicaid. `` Despite greater rates of employer coverage, poor children in worker families are about 38 percent more likely than children in poor, non-worker families to be uninsured,'' the institute said in its report, `` Uninsured in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' It said that among children in poor, single-parent families headed by a full-time worker, 53.1 percent had no health insurance, either public or private. Among poor, single-parent families headed by an unemployed adult, 30.1 percent of children were not covered. Overall, the report found that 88 percent of the 37 million Americans who were uninsured in 1986 either were workers themselves or lived in families that included workers. Nearly 18 percent of the civilian population under age 65 reported no health insurance from any source. <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Chollet </PERSON>, the senior research associate who completed the study, said that even among workers where family income was four times or more of the poverty level, there were 5.2 million individuals without health insurance. `` A surprising number of them have family incomes that are quite high and that at least you would expect they would both value and buy health insurance and they do n't for some unknown reason,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Chollet </PERSON> said some of these people may think they ca n't afford health insurance but have n't thoroughly checked around for affordable coverage. Some may be uninsurable because of certain health problems, and others may not be educated about the need for coverage. Ms. <PERSON> Chollet </PERSON> said both presidential candidates' health insurance proposals still would leave millions of Americans uninsured, but that Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' plan would cover far more than <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' proposal to expand employer-provided health insurance could extend coverage to 23 million uninsured individuals at a cost of $ 22 billion to employers and $ 5 billion to workers, she said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal, still sketchy, would allow more low-income people to `` buy in'' to the Medicaid program, but his plan to spend $ 400 million in the first year and $ 200 million thereafter is inadequate to bring in very many people, Ms. <PERSON> Chollet </PERSON> said. The institute is a non-partisan research organization.

 An auctioneer examining a collection of papers in preparation for an estate sale found `` the absolute dream of every autograph collector'' _ a letter written by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>. The one-page letter, dated Dec. 10, 1796, was addressed to a <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> and concerned a suggestion <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> had made about agricultural policy. `` I have n't slept a lot since Saturday night,'' <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Riner </PERSON> said about his discovery, made when he examined documents in the estate of an ailing <LOCATION> Lakeland </LOCATION> resident, whose hobby was collecting historical documents.

The networks are seeking a court order blocking the law through the Nov. 8 election. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doty </PERSON> took the request under advisement and said he would rule before Election Day. <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> attorney representing <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, told <PERSON> Doty </PERSON> the 1984 law would prevent family members from asking each other how they voted if they were within the zoned area. `` Here is an amendment, on its face, which makes it illegal for my daughter to ask me how I voted,'' he said. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerberg </PERSON>, a special assistant state attorney general, noted that the state has imposed other restrictions on activities near the polling place, such as distributing political literature. `` Voters should not be required to run a gauntlet of questioners,'' <PERSON> Ackerberg </PERSON> said. `` They should be allowed to walk away in peace from this sanctified place.'' He added: `` Election Day is not an event staged for the media.'' Exit polling became controversial in 1980 when it became clear after polls closed in the East that <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would defeat President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> by a landslide. Many Westerners were still voting when the networks declared <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> the winner. The three major networks say this year they will project winners of the presidential race state-by-state as polls close, but will refrain from declaring a winner overall until after voters on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> cast their ballots. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said the networks have successfully fought similar exit polling restrictions in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> is the last state where such a law is being challenged. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said the state has a legitimate interest in passing laws to alleviate congestion around polling places. `` But this is a blunderbuss way of dealing with that problem,'' he said. The intent of the law, he argued, is to prevent the networks from conducting exit polls. `` What they -LRB- legislators -RRB- were after is speech they did n't like, and that's simply off-limits to them,'' he said. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said the law prevents anyone from approaching a voter within 50 feet of a polling place and prevents the voter from being asked how he or she voted within 50 feet to 100 feet of the polling place. `` There's no evidence one could do exit polling that works at that distance,'' he said.

 Two Marine Corps helicopters probably collided before each crashed, killing nine <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> and one <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officer while on a desert training mission, <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> officials said today. `` We feel confident enough to say a midair collision was more than likely,'' said Gunnery Sgt. <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>, a spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Yuma </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> said the two helicopters that crashed Tuesday night _ a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> CH-46 and a <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> UH-1N _ flew from the <LOCATION> Yuma </LOCATION> base but neither were actually stationed there. The CH-46 was from the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and the UH-1N was from <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pendleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> also said that, though spokesmen initially said four men were aboard the CH-46 and six aboard the UH-1N, there was uncertainty about the actual distribution of the men between the two aircraft. The crash site about 16 miles southeast of here, on the <ORGANIZATION> Goldwater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Range </ORGANIZATION>, was in an area so rough that four-wheel-drive vehicles had trouble reaching it, said 1st Lt. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>, public affairs officer at the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Yuma </LOCATION>. The last body was not recovered until late Wednesday afternoon, said <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>. The men were participating in the final training exercise of a weapons-and-tactics instructors' training course taught twice a year at the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Yuma </LOCATION>, 125 miles southwest of the crash site. The course is an advanced program in battle tactics, including moving personnel from place to place, rescuing wounded and countering enemy weapons and aircraft. The crash was the second in the course's history. In 1984, two Marines were killed when their light observation plane crashed on the range. The twin-rotor CH-46 Sea Knight, which <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> stopped building in 1971, is the Marine's main assault helicopter. Three Marines were killed in May when a CH-46 crashed during a test flight from <ORGANIZATION> Kaneohe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. A Marine CH-46 carrying 21 men crashed in 1986, killing eight during a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> exercise off <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. In one of the worst crashes involving the helicopter, 14 Marines and a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> chaplain were killed in 1985 when a CH-46 crashed into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. On Monday, a UH-1H helicopter hit a power line and crashed near the U.S.-Mexico border in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, killing five lawmen and three National Guardsmen during the first mission of a joint anti-drug smuggling program. The identify of one Marine killed Tuesday was being withheld pending notification of next of kin. But the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION> Air Station in <LOCATION> Yuma </LOCATION> identified the others as Maj. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, 35, of <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>.; Capt. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>; Capt. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heyl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> Middlesex </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; Cpl. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Horvath </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Beallsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; Capt. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Royal </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>; Cpl. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON>, 20, <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atkinson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>; Capt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuver </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; and Cpl. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waid </PERSON>, no age or hometown available, stationed at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pendleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>.

 Graying veterans of <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>'s 1948 presidential campaign celebrated anew the triumph the experts said was impossible, but offered scant hope to Democrats looking for a repeat in 1988. They were wild about <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> all over again at Wednesday night's reunion at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, where they gathered to watch a public television documentary on `` The Great Upset of'48. The show will air nationally Tuesday night. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON>, the governor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, was so confident of victory and so far ahead in the polls he did n't begin campaigning until Sept. 19. He skirted issues, prompting reporters to speculate that his middle initial stood for `` Elusive.'' <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON>'s confidence was such that he `` had been negotiating the purchase of a suit to be inaugurated in,'' recalled author <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON>, who covered the race for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, the onetime haberdasher from <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, had inherited the Oval Office when <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> died in 1945, but the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was splintered, with <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> running on <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>'s left and <PERSON> Dixiecrat </PERSON> <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, then governor of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, on his right. The incumbent's campaign got off to a hapless start, with <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> addressing a half-empty hall in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, dedicating an airport in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> to the wrong person and pronouncing <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> `` a decent fellow'' in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> also relentlessly pummeled the `` do-nothing'' <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, vetoed the Taft-Hartley bill to shore up labor support, appealed to farmers and stood fast for civil rights. <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> picked up an endorsement from a movie actor named <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Screen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Actors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION>, who said in a radio ad he was `` more than a little impatient with those promises the Republicans made before they got control of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a couple of years ago.'' So daunting was <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON>'s lead that the <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> organization did not bother to survey after early September. `` The polls were completely wrong,'' said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Sevareid </PERSON>, then a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> reporter, who recalls the big crowds that turned out as <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>'s train, the <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Magellan </PERSON>, covered 31,000 miles across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` We began to think, ` Something is going on here,' but none of us had enough guts to go bet even at 9-1,'' said <PERSON> Sevareid </PERSON>. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>, <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>'s counsel, recalled that if someone did n't spontaneously shout `` Give'em hell, Harry'' in the first minute of <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>'s speeches, the campaign staff would dispatch someone to do the job `` It was called priming the pump,'' said <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>. After the severe-looking <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> was ridiculed by tart-tongued <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> <PERSON> Longworth </PERSON> as `` the little man on the wedding cake,'' campaign manager <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brownell </PERSON> urged the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> governor to shave off his mustache. But Mrs. <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> said no. `` She thought that was trimming his sails for political purposes,'' <PERSON> Brownell </PERSON> told the documentary-makers. <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> canvassed 50 top political writers, and every one picked <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON>. <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> laughed it off, saying he knew all 50 and `` not one of them has enough sense to pound sand in a rat hole.'' On election night, Nov. 2, 1948, legendary <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> announcer H.V. <PERSON> Kaltenborn </PERSON> assured Americans that despite an early lead for <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> would prevail `` when the outlying districts are reported.'' When editors at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> heard that broadcast, they ordered the presses to roll with the headline, `` DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN'' _ and created a collector's item that <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> held up in jubilation the next day after his 2 million-vote victory. Is there a lesson in all this for the 1988 race, when most polls now point to a big lead for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> over <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>? If <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> were alive, `` he'd be giving hell to both candidates for waging one of the sorriest campaigns of this century,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, the narrator of the documentary and host of public television's `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Week in Review.'' <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> observed, `` The trouble from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' point of view is that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> knows the Dewey story, too. A lot of people have learned a big lesson from <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON>. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is one of them.''

<HEAD>Medicare Payment Changes Need More Study Says JAMA Editorial</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For Release 5:30 p.m. EDT.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Proposed changes in the way <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> payments to physicians are calculated should be studied carefully before they are put into practice, say editorials in the latest Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The recommendations, made last month, would sharply increase the amount of money physicians are paid for office visits and reduce fees for surgery and other procedures, such as installing pacemakers. The plan developed by economist <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsiao </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> needs to be reviewed by the medical profession, Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> wrote in an editorial appearing in Friday's JAMA. `` There must be external review and validation of the study's credibility, reliability and validity,'' <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> wrote `` No less important will be the consideration of whether and how this academic research should be translated into the cold, hard realities of Medicare policy.'' The proposal is `` certain to stir controversy among physicians'' and should be examined further, Dr. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Physician </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Payment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>, the panel's executive director, wrote in a second editorial The Washington-based organization was created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 to advise it on reforms in <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>'s methods of paying physicians. It commissioned the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> study. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> would `` work closely with specialty societies and state medical associations'' to evaluate the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> proposal. The plan places a non-monetary value on tasks doctors perform. For example, a comprehensive visit by a new patient to a general practitioner is 248, while a well-baby visit is 64 and a triple coronary bypass is 2,871. The value would be multiplied by a monetary conversion figure, determined by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for Medicare, or by insurance companies, to figure out how much doctors should be paid. Under current Medicare policies, physicians are paid less for day-to-day management of their patients than they are for exotic tests and other procedures. The new proposal would not penalize doctors for spending time with patients. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> said the values were based on averages and `` can not recognize differences among physicians in patient mix, quality or practice costs. `` A properly working ... fee schedule will require the flexibility that comes with physicians' ability to determine their own charges using -LRB- the value scale -RRB- as a foundation,'' he wrote. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> said the proposal should not be the only criteria in determining new fee schedules for doctors. `` Other components should include geographic multipliers that determine how payments would vary from one locality to another,'' they wrote.

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has begun recalling nearly 750,000 1984-model cars and trucks bearing Chevrolet, <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> and GMC nameplates to replace a defective switch in the pollution control system, the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The action brings to 2.4 million the number of <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> cars and trucks from the 1982, 1983 and 1984 model years recalled to install new thermal vacuum switches, which control emissions during warmup. A defective switch can cause excessive emissions of carbon monoxide and unburned gasoline.

 Students at a school for the deaf asked to be tested for the AIDS virus after learning that a former school worker had contracted the virus and that there may have been sexual activity between staff and students. The <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> for the Deaf will ask parents of students age 12 and over if they want the state <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to test their children for exposure to the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Superintendent <PERSON> Alma </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said Wednesday that she had called a meeting of students after hearing that most had learned of a possible problem from news reports the day before. `` Some of them asked if they could be tested,'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said, `` so I asked what their feeling was, if I could have a show of hands on who would like to be tested, and almost all of them raised their hands.'' Dr. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, state epidemiologist, said the youths would be tested `` as soon as they have the parents' permission for it.'' Results probably would come a few weeks later. The state had received information earlier that a former employee had contracted the AIDS virus and that there had been sexual activity between staff members and students. The first allegation was verified, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. While there was no hard evidence of sexual misconduct, he said, there was sufficient evidence to warrant testing. About half of the school's 160 students are 12 and older. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said the former employee left the school in the summer. She said she is confident the employee who resigned had not had sexual relations with anyone on campus.

 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has promised the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that it will reject domestic pressures and prevent the sale of militarily sensitive technology to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Thursday. The assurances were made last week in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> in advance of this week's trip to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> by Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and a group of 30 businessmen who have signed deals estimated at over $ 1 billion, said an official. The West Germans consulted with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> about the deals they intended to sign, `` and we could see they were being very careful,'' said the official, who spoke on condition he not be identified. At the same time, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has warned <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and other allies in the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, or <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION>, against being lulled into a false sense of security by recent Soviet reforms, the official said. <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION> determines which technologies members of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> can sell to the Soviet bloc. `` We have received assurances from -LRB- <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- that it will observe established <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION> procedures when it comes to carrying out the various commercial agreements reached by German firms in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>. The West German assurances were given last week to Ambassador <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wendt </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s specialist on export controls, who held talks in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> as part of regularly scheduled consultations on <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION>. The Paris-based organization has been seeking to streamline its complex list of banned technologies in response to the economic liberalization of several Soviet bloc countries. The next full round of consultations on the changes is not expected until next spring, when the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration is in place. `` We and our allies sometimes can and do differ on specifics or exactly what needs to be done ... to ensure that we have strong barriers around critical technologies,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. `` As allies, we settle these differences on an ongoing basis within <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION>,'' he added. But the other official said `` some people'' within <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION> have been urging a wholesale lifting of controls on exports to the Soviet bloc. He declined to name names but indicated that West German officials were among those to whom he referred. `` There are domestic political pressures in some countries to relax <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION> restrictions,'' this official said. `` If you are living across the border from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, for example, the temptation to believe the Soviet threat is over is great.'' West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> has been advocating greater trade with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> as a way of stimulating the stagnant economy and creating jobs. But <PERSON> Wendt </PERSON> made it clear to the allies that `` the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> threat has to change before <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION> can relax its rules,'' the official said.

 An appeals court has ordered a new trial for a girl sentenced to life at age 15 for the murder of her grandfather, ruling that evidence should have been allowed undermining a confession she later recanted. It noted, for example, that she had used drugs for 12 years. The 4th <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday overturned the 1986 murder conviction of <PERSON> Cara </PERSON> <PERSON> McIntosh </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pompano </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, now 17, who is serving a life sentence with a mandatory minimum of 25 years. `` When I called her at the prison she just cried, she was so happy,'' said her attorney, <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Krasnove </PERSON>. `` She's been waiting for so long to hear some good news, and I think she was starting to think we'd lost.'' <PERSON> Cara </PERSON>, her mother <PERSON> Paulette </PERSON>, and one of her mother's friends, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Dameron </PERSON>, were convicted of murder in the death of <PERSON> Paulette </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Emmett </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>. His body was found in a canal May 30, 1986. All three were sentenced to life in prison. In a confession she later recanted, <PERSON> Cara </PERSON> told police that she was present during the crime and had held a sock to her grandfather's mouth while others tied and gagged him while stealing money for drugs from his business `` The jury believed the tape and did n't believe what she said on the stand,'' said prosecuting attorney <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Coyle </PERSON>. The appellate ruling said the trial court should have allowed testimony about <PERSON> Paulette </PERSON> <PERSON> McIntosh </PERSON>'s psychological grip over her daughter and about <PERSON> Cara </PERSON>'s drug addiction. <PERSON> Cara </PERSON> was introduced to marijuana at the age of 3 -LCB- by her parents, the News and <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Sentinel </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. `` Testimony regarding -LRB- <PERSON> Cara </PERSON>'s -RRB- mother's control and domination over -LRB- <PERSON> Cara </PERSON> -RRB- was a circumstance surrounding -LRB- <PERSON> Cara </PERSON>'s -RRB- confession because her mother was being interrogated in a nearby police room and had told -LRB- <PERSON> Cara </PERSON> -RRB- to go along with whatever she said,'' the appeal court opinion said. `` During -LRB- <PERSON> Cara </PERSON>'s -RRB- interrogation, the police told her that her mother had said certain things and that if she agreed with them, she could go home.'' The opinion also said she was `` coming down from a high'' at the time of the confession. The state has two weeks to file a motion for a rehearing, or it could proceed with a new trial.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is trying to encourage political liberalization in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by holding out the prospect of the eventual full integration of these countries into the Western economic system. Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, who returned recently from a visit to the six Soviet allies in that region, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be prepared to `` welcome these countries into the Western world,'' provided they continue on their reformist path. In an interview Wednesday, <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> outlined his impressions of his 11-day trip, which took him to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. With the exception of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said, `` there is dramatic change going on in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'' resulting from public dissatisfaction with stagnant or declining economies. He said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> are at the forefront of change, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> is lagging behind and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> are `` somewhere in between.'' <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said he expects the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> military alliance to remain in tact but added there is a strong desire for the departure of Soviet troops in the four countries where they are stationed. There are an estimated 380,000 Soviet troops in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, 80,000 in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, 65,000 in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and 40,000 in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` I think the countries are becoming more independent of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said. `` They are beginning to return to their historical position where they were independent countries, part of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, associated with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> economically, politically. And I believe they are beginning to return to historically their more normal position.'' As the liberalization process continues, <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said he envisions greater East European participation in the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, two pillars of the Western economic system. He also foresees increased <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government involvement in encouraging trade with and private investment in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> has made six trips to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in his role as Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s principal liaison with countries in the area. Part of his assignment is to encourage the changes now taking place. The administration has felt that with the ambitious political and economic reform movement in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, change was inevitable in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and officials have been monitoring developments there far more closely than before. <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said he does not foresee popular uprisings taking place in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON>, a Polish-born former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> national security adviser, wrote recently that several countries in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are `` potentially ripe for revolutionary explosion.'' `` It is not an exaggeration to say this could happen in more than one at the same time,'' <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON> said. A major exception to the reform movement now under way is <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> where, <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said, an `` absolutely outrageous'' human rights situation exists as a result of a government plan to demolish up to 7,000 villages under an agricultural modernization project. He said the people in these villages are being moved to `` cement-block, barracks-like structures'' with no running water and no toilets. `` You can imagine living in an apartment house with no toilets. It's pretty atrocious,'' <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said. He called the forced resettlement policy `` an atrocious violation of human rights that I have never seen before anywhere in the world _ a government destroying the homes of its citizens and forcing them to move into what look like military barracks.''

 Palestinians buried the 19 people killed in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s most destructive air raid of the year and subsequent ground fighting, then fled Thursday as <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes streaked low overhead but did not attack. The dead were taken by small funeral processions to the main cemetery of this ancient southern port and a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> graveyard in the nearby village of Darb el-Seem after Moslem noon prayers. Sirens wailed as mourners started home to the Mieh Mieh refugee camp, target of the air raid. Guerrillas and civilians scattered, ducking for cover as two jets flashed past. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> originally planned mass funerals for the 15 people killed at <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>'s southern fringe, and four guerrillas killed in fighting east of the city with militia allies of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. A guerrilla officer, who would not give his name, said plans were changed because `` we just could n't risk mass gatherings. With <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s appetite for attacking at its peak, we figured it's prudent to keep a low profile.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> urged all parties to hold their fire. Those involved `` must keep in mind that the pattern of action and reaction and the continuing violence in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has a negative impact which serves the interests of no one,'' spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. `` Restraint would serve the interests of all and contribute to security and stability.'' Wednesday's rocket attack destroyed 30 buildings of a guerrilla base in <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION>. Police said rescuers searched the rubble all night and dug out nine bodies. They said the bodies were of three guerrillas and a family of six _ parents and four children, two sons and two daughters aged 6 to 15. Six people were reported killed and 40 wounded immediately after the raid on the base, which belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group led by <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. Fighting began in hills east of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> soon afterward. The <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> militia that acts as <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s surrogate, attacked positions held by Palestinians and leftist Lebanese militiamen for the first time since 1985. A statement by the militia said its fighters captured a strategic hill overlooking <LOCATION> Jezzine </LOCATION>, the largest Christian town in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and killed four guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> faction led by terrorist <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>. It acknowledged one militiaman killed and one wounded and said the attackers captured three followers of <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>, whose real name is <PERSON> Sabry </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Banna </PERSON>. Palestinian sources at <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> el-Hilweh refugee camp confirmed the losses and said <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s commander east of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, known by the code name <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabie </PERSON>, was among the dead. Guerrillas had used the outpost to to harass <LOCATION> Jezzine </LOCATION>, 11 miles west of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, with mortar and sniper fire. Only one of the 19 Israeli air raids into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year killed more people than the strike at <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION>. The first attack, Jan. 3, took 26 lives and wounded 30 people at a guerrilla base north of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. Both police and <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen said Wednesday's raid was the worst in terms of destruction and guerrilla casualties. `` Mieh Mieh has suffered the most severe destruction since <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 1982 invasion'' of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said a police spokesman in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, whose name can not be used because of regulations. The air raid on the refugee camp, and a later strike Wednesday at a guerrilla base outside <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, were the third and fourth since a Shiite Moslem driver detonated a car bomb last week in an army convoy in the `` security zone'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> maintains just north of the border. Eight israeli soldiers were killed, and seven soldiers and two local women wounded. Israeli fighter-bombers struck <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla bases Friday and Sunday, killing 21 people and wounding 34. On Tuesday, Israeli troops and their militia allies foiled two attempts by Palestinian guerrillas to infiltrate northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

 Two whales that held the world's attention for weeks swam away from their icy trap but remained today in a slushy channel cleared by Soviet icebreakers, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. Rescuers still hoped the leviathans would follow the ships out into open sea. `` You break a path and it's like a Sno-Cone behind you, it freezes overnight. ...,'' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Massey </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` They're probably going from hole to hole in small pools behind the icebreaker.'' After dawn broke this morning, helicopter crews headed out in hopes of better determining the status of the two <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gray whales, whom scientists had dubbed Crossbeak and <PERSON> Bonnet </PERSON>. `` We're going to have to do a nose count,'' said Sgt <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. He said at least two helicopters were being sent up. <PERSON> Massey </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> post was receiving messages from a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> guardsman assigned as liaison aboard one of the two Soviet icebreakers that continued to clear the way for the whales the day after the breakthrough that got the whales out of their solid-ice trap. `` It's in nature's hands now,'' <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hufford </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> ice analyst, had said earlier. The whales swam Wednesday on what was hoped would be a long journey to their winter home off <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. But officials said there were still some ways from the open sea, in the path cleared by the icebreakers earlier and already partially refrozen. `` My understanding is that the whales were still in the channels and that they -LRB- icebreakers -RRB- were going to have to do more cutting,'' <PERSON> Massey </PERSON> said. `` They're going to open a path to real open water and hope they follow them out. ... If we just walked off and left them now, I do n't think they could get out on their own. If the breakers go out, then they should be able to follow to go to open water.'' The fate of the whales may never be known. Scientists involved in the rescue that cost more than $ 800,000 did n't attach radio transmitters to the whales, in part because of concern that the devices would only add to the animals' stress, said federal marine mammal biologist <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>. A whale that was trapped with the pair nearly three weeks ago apparently died last week. But a major factor in the decision against the transmitters was that `` a lot of people really did n't want to know'' the surviving whales' fate, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said. In a final frenzy Wednesday, Eskimos using chain saws cut 50 new breathing holes into the ice, nearly as many as they had cut in two weeks. The whales, which grew accustomed to the cutting, repeatedly surfaced in the new holes before the last block of ice was removed. The animals moved to less than half a mile from a channel carved through the 18-inch-thick ice by two Soviet icebreakers late Tuesday and early Wednesday. Then, the Eskimos were ordered to retreat so the icebreaker <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Arseniev </PERSON> could reopen the channel, already partially refrozen. Scrambling to safety on Nuvuagluak Spit, the rescuers were joined by a press corps that nearly outnumbered them. After two hours and no movement by the icebreaker, the Eskimos grew impatient. Their years of experience with the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> told them that a rising wind could begin stacking up the ice and undo all the progress. Faced with a near revolt, rescue coordinators allowed the natives back onto the ice, and they quickly moved the whales to within one-quarter mile of the channel the Soviets had cut Tuesday. Finally, the icebreaker appeared out of the snowy squall line ahead. Just after 4 p.m. -LRB- 9 p.m. EDT -RRB-, rescue coordinator <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> reported from his helicopter that the whales had surfaced in a small pool in the old channel. One was bleeding enough to stain the ice and surrounding water. They then slipped beneath the surface. Moments later, the whales appeared about 25 feet away in open water left by the icebreaker. The crowd cheered. As darkness fell, the whales were moving along the channel, which the <PERSON> Arseniev </PERSON> continued to clear, at least two miles from any significant open water. `` They're in the main lead, and I ca n't help but think they'll keep on truckin','' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said `` I do n't know how much more we can do.'' `` I learned a lot,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Slope </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Borough </LOCATION> wildlife biologist who babysat for the whales from the time they were found trapped. `` I learned that with persistence, clear thinking and proper chain saws, you can do anything.'' The rescue effort initially bogged down with an attempt to move a 185-ton ice-breaking barge from the <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> oil field 200 miles away. The barge progressed just six miles in about as many days. The <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> then donated a huge helicopter that dropped a 5-ton concrete cylinder through the ice. But it proved to be of little value. A $ 600,000 device known as an Archimedes screw tractor, mounted on auger-driven pontoons, was loaned by the oil industry, but a test run showed the slushy trail it left made it unsuitable. The rescue finally came down to a few dozen Eskimos working from dawn until dark cutting holes to keep the whales alive and the Soviet icebreakers, whose help was solicited last weekend. The endangered <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gray whales have one of the longest migration routes of all mammals, 6,000 to 8,000 miles from the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> to the warm water off <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Their population has risen to about 20,000, growing at an annual average of 2.5 percent for the past decade, officials said. `` The human persistence and determination by so many individuals on behalf of these whales shows mankind's concern for the environment,'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said from the White House. `` It has been an inspiring endeavor.'' Precise figures on the cost of the rescue effort were n't available, but an estimate of at least $ 800,000 was compiled from estimates of a variety of governmental and private agencies and businesses that took part Rear Adm. <PERSON> Sigmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> of the federal <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said this morning on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' that the cost to the federal government was relatively small.

 Denouncing what it called `` one of the great scandals of American conservation,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday chose 10 national wildlife refuges as most endangered to spotlight threats to the refuge system. `` These 10 refuges are just the tip of the iceberg,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Frampton </PERSON>, president of the society. `` From <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> the refuge system is threatened by poisonous agricultural runoff containing heavy metals, toxic chemicals and pesticides; by wetlands drainage and water diversion; by overcrowding and off-road vehicles; by oil drilling and other incompatible activities.'' A report from the society describing the 10 said, `` Without prompt action, some of them may die.'' In no particular order, these are the 10 most threatened: National Key Deer in the western <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Loxahatchee </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> swamp; <LOCATION> Stillwater </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Reno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Chincoteague </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> coast; <LOCATION> Yazoo </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s North Slope; <LOCATION> Lower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Kesterson </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> along the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> shores of the river; and Great Swamp in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, 25 miles from <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <PERSON> Kesterson </PERSON> is so contaminated by irrigation runoff that many ducks stopping there are killed, and most of the staff's time is spent trying to keep waterfowl from landing. The society described the refuge as `` in a coma.'' <PERSON> Frampton </PERSON> said the 445 refuges managed by the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> have taken a back seat to the national parks, which have major legislation spelling out protections, a huge supporting constituency derived from 300 million annual visitors and a history of being carved out of the wilderness decades ago. `` By contrast, many of our refuges are mere remnants _ designated during development projects as a sop to environmentalists to protect the few remaining fragments of habitat within a much greater area destroyed,'' <PERSON> Frampton </PERSON> said. The society called on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to spell out goals and philosophy of the system, something no statute now does, to appropriate more money for land purchase and for the service to use more of its funds for protection and less for bureaucratic overhead. Also, the service must do more to protect water quality, and should renegotiate agreements with landowners, often other federal or state agencies, `` so that refuge managers have more control over the quality of the habitat. ... In many cases, the best solution is probably to transfer title to the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` All of these threats are man-caused,'' <PERSON> Frampton </PERSON> said. `` Almost all of them could be mitigated or controlled by intelligent management.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkle </PERSON>, director of the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement: `` The situations cited by the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> are not new, nor are they being ignored. The society seems to think we can build a moat around each of our 445 refuges to protect them from pollution and other external threats. Unfortunately, that just is not possible. `` I wish, however, the society had given us and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> more credit for what we are doing to combat the problems identified in the report.'' The society said these refuges did n't make the top 10 but had serious problems anyway: <PERSON> Fallon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Bowdoin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Hakalau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Souris </LOCATION> and <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Salyer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Ouray </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Kenai </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Tule </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.

 Here are the choices of the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> for the nation's 10 most threatened wildlife refuges, some problems listed by the society at each and some of the society's recommendations There is no significance to the order of listing. _ National Key Deer, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> As many as 20 percent of the deer are killed by cars each year, with more mauled by pet dogs of residents and visitors. Construction `` continues to gobble up lands vital to a healthy deer population.'' Domestic waste is polluting refuge waters. Additional land must be bought. _ <LOCATION> Loxahatchee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Nearby development has made water flow patterns much more variable, and heavy fertilizer use is contaminating the refuge. A solid waste disposal plant has been proposed on adjacent land. Water flow and quality should be improved and the waste plant abandoned. _ <LOCATION> Stillwater </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> It `` has become the dumping ground for arsenic, boron, selenium, lithium and other toxins that are in the pesticide-laden runoff and return flows'' from a nearby irrigation project. Water flow must be increased, possibly through `` purchase of water rights from farmers, several of whom are willing to sell them.'' _ <LOCATION> Chincoteague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> A million visitors a year are putting pressure on wildlife nesting. An off-road vehicle ban last summer was `` a dramatic success'' in helping restore the endangered piping plover and should be continued. Land acquisition should be stepped up and auto traffic reduced. _ <LOCATION> Yazoo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> Agricultural runoff is bringing in heavy concentrations of pesticides and there is `` significant doubt'' that a segment of drainage projects by the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> will be able to ease runoff and siltation damage as claimed. The drainage projects should be stopped. _ Arctic, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Oil companies and the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> want to explore for oil, which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has not permitted. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should make it a wilderness area where all development is banned. _ Lower <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Nearby pesticide spraying and runoff, waste water discharges and planned real estate development are the major threats. Land acquisition must be accelerated since only a fifth of what was planned has been incorporated into the refuge. _ <LOCATION> Kesterson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> `` In a coma'' because of selenium poisoning from irrigation runoff that has killed thousands of ducks and other waterfowl. Because the area is `` critically important'' to migrating birds, nearby land should be bought to replace the lost habitat. _ <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Soil erosion is damaging habitat and reproduction. Wastewater and pesticide-loaded agricultural runoff is polluting refuge waters and heavy recreation use is hurting habitat. The service should acquire the half of the refuge owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> and should add staff. _ Great Swamp, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Population growth is straining two sewage treatment plants whose outflow eventually reaches the refuge. Road salt, fertilizer and pesticides are reaching the refuge and old toxic dumps threaten contamination. Water quality monitoring should be improved and dumps should be cleaned up.

Biamonte _ who tracks reluctant witnesses for the <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney and is a local political consultant _ started an organization earlier this year called <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Watch </PERSON> and published the first issue of what he hopes will be a regular publication, `` The Brownie Journal.'' The publication, reprinting newspaper articles, goes out to 180 former <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> campaign contributors whose names were on a list Biamonte bought from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` All along, I think his strength has been that he has a very dedicated constituency,'' <PERSON> Biamonte </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. <PERSON> Biamonte </PERSON>'s fascination dates to 1976, when <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> first ran for president. His interest waned a bit in the succeeding few years, but when he met <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> during the 1980 presidential campaign, the spark was rekindled in a hurry. `` That's when I got the idea that he was the candidate for the future,'' he said. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the son of a former <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> governor, was embraced by many as a sort of new-age Democrat _ an ex-seminarian, a student of <ORGANIZATION> Zen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buddhism </ORGANIZATION>, companion of singer <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronstadt </PERSON> and enthusiast of alternative energy sources like windmills. He often was accused of blowing with the political wind, as well _ opposing tax cuts, but then embracing them and pushing through his own cuts. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> lost a bid for <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1982 and retired from politics. <PERSON> Biamonte </PERSON> followed his subsequent international wanderings from afar and began to establish a network of fellow Brownies who fed each other information. Now <PERSON> Biamonte </PERSON> believes his patience may be paying off. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> recently announced his candidacy for chairmanship of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. What does <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> think of this unsolicited support? The former governor, reached at his <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> law office, seemed momentarily nonplussed by the question. `` Um,'' he said. `` Uh, he ... he's someone who met me several years ago and he's been an enthusiastic supporter ever since. He's got a lot of energy and a lot of enthusiasm and he keeps a lot of people who supported me together. `` He's a completely independent operator in all this,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Biamonte </PERSON> acknowledges that his is strictly a unofficial effort. But he dreams of a more official role in some future <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> campaign. `` That's one of my fantasies,'' he said, `` having a really good job working for <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>.'' Such dedication prompts expressions of wonderment from some former <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> supporters, such as 1980 campaign official <PERSON> Josiah </PERSON> <PERSON> Beeman </PERSON>. `` The guy is just a dedicated, 100 percent <PERSON> Brownie </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Beeman </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Documents Show FBI, Military Intelligence, Knew Of Illegal Aid To

<TEXT>
 Two men accused of violating <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law by illegally aiding the Nicaraguan Contra rebels regularly briefed the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and intelligence agencies about their activities, according to documents released in a criminal case. The documents also show <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> police informed the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in September 1984 of the existence of the Contra-supporting group <ORGANIZATION> Civilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Materiel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION>, and that drug-trafficking money was being used to finance the Contra cause. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in turn was sending its reports to <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> said Thursday he had not seen the documents, but added: `` I doubt we will be able to comment because it concerns a matter before the courts.'' He did, however, say that the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> police intelligence report which told of drug money going to <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> supporters, and said dynamite was shipped to them on commercial airliners, had been investigated and found vague. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> police, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reports were contained in a motion by defense attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattes </PERSON> accusing the government of selectively prosecuting his client, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON> and six other men, including <ORGANIZATION> CMA </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Posey </PERSON> and his <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> coordinator, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Coutin </PERSON>, were indicted in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> in June on charges of violating the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Neutrality Act in 1984 and 1985. They are accused of illegally recruiting mercenaries and shipping weapons to aid the Contras. `` The documents clearly show the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> acquiesced in all this conduct,'' <PERSON> Mattes </PERSON> said. `` They detail the exact persons, their names, their property and even the exact air strips the Contra supporters were working from.'' A declassified report from military intelligence agent <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Camper </PERSON> showed the DIA not only knew of the activities in April 1984, but outlined for <PERSON> Posey </PERSON> and a <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> official a plan for `` deep penetration raids into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'' by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> volunteers and Nicaraguan rebels. As early as January 1985 <PERSON> Posey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Coutin </PERSON> were both reporting regularly to <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, and other places, advising them of their plans to aid the Contras, their contacts in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and their frequent trips to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, according to the documents. Both the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the two men were aware the network might violate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> neutrality laws, which bar launching military activities against a government with which the nation is at peace. A Jan. 23, 1985, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report from <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> quoted <PERSON> Posey </PERSON> as saying that on a trip to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> he was told that the `` neutrality matter'' would be closed. <PERSON> Posey </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> he had been assured he would not be prosecuted `` if he continued to cooperate and to provide intelligence info re: current developments in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report said. A Jan. 8, 1985, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> concludes with a note that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> had asked to be given all information on the case. `` <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> headquarters is requested to disseminate above information to <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' it says. In all, <PERSON> Coutin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Posey </PERSON> talked to <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> at least six times in January 1985, and <PERSON> Posey </PERSON> also spoke to agents in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Coutin </PERSON> also talked in September 984 to a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> police unit investigating a bombing at a bank and mentioned his pro-Contra activities, the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> police report said. The report also said <PERSON> Coutin </PERSON> told the police that alleged cocaine trafficker <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Chanes </PERSON> was giving money to anti-Castro and <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> groups, and that `` the monies comes from narcotic transactions.'' It said a police source, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, claimed <PERSON> Chanes </PERSON> spent thousands on the rebels, and that <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Corvo </PERSON> _ indicted this summer in an associated Neutrality Act case _ put dynamite in his luggage on a commercial flight to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> for delivery to the Contras. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said a full <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation cast doubt on <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>'s account.

<HEAD>Farmers Started Year With Higher Incomes, Lower Costs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The financial health of the nation's farmers at the beginning of 1988 was the best in years, <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> economists said Thursday. Higher incomes, lower operating costs, a 45 percent increase in government payments and a modest rise in farm product sales contributed to the improvement, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said in an annual review. The 176-page analysis did not forecast 1988 financial returns or assess the impact of this year's drought, although other reports have pointed to net cash income levels at near the record 1987 level. However, those reports emphasized that thousands of farmers have been hurt severely in 1988 by drought losses to crops and livestock while others have prospered because of the reduced supplies and higher prices. The latest report said that real net income in 1987 reached $ 38 billion after adjusting for inflation, the highest level since the mid-1970s and `` was on a par with that of the 1950s and 1960s.'' Rising land values, which represent 70 percent of all farm assets, and lower debt boosted the equity, or net worth, of farmers as of Jan. 1, 1988, to $ 571 billion from $ 537 billion a year earlier, the report said. That reversed a six-year decline. `` The most dramatic farm financial change in the past few years has been the improvement in the solvency position of farms,'' the report said. Solvency, or the ability to pay debts, is one of the measures of financial health in the farm sector. Others include liquidity, or the capability of making payments when they come due, and profitability, or net farm income. `` Higher net farm income in 1987 helped farmers reduce or pay off debt and provided more farms with enough capital to avoid new debt financing than in previous years,'' the report said. `` Asset values rose 3 percent over those of 1986, while debt fell 8 percent to $ 143 billion in 1987 -LRB- the fourth annual decline in a row -RRB-, leaving the sector in the best position at any time in the 1980s to meet debt service obligations.'' According the an annual survey of farm costs and returns, nearly 80 percent of the nation's farms were profitable in 1987, up from 70 percent in 1986. The report said that nearly 44 percent of all farms were free of debt at the beginning of 1988, compared with less than 39 percent a year earlier. There was a large variation, however, in debt owed by different size farms. Only 16 percent of the largest _ those with sales of more than $ 500,000 a year _ were free of debt at the start of this year, compared with almost 60 percent of the smallest farms, or those with sales of less than $ 10,000 annually.

<HEAD>FCC Eases Ownership Rule for Nearby Radio Stations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> took a step Thursday toward shoring up struggling radio stations by voting to allow common ownership of stations located closer together but still in different markets. By relaxing its ownership rule, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said it would enable more station owners to take greater advantage of the economies of scale and cost savings that result from joint ownership of stations. The new rule would reduce by about half the distance required between two stations owned by the same person or company. It also would allow common ownership of stations in adjacent markets. Under the new rule, commonly owned stations could be as close as 25 miles. The commission had planned also to consider changing other rules that limit common ownership in the same market to AM-FM combinations but allow waivers for some UHF-TV and radio combinations. But commissioners could not agree on the proposed changes. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> also agreed to recommend that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> require cable companies to negotiate with out-of-town TV stations for the rights to carry their signals. The commission is expected to extend that recommendation to cover local TV signals before it issues a final order in the matter. Currently, cable companies have a `` compulsory license,'' granted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1976, giving them the right to carry local and distant broadcast signals for what is often a bargain price. The system of low prices was established because cable companies were required to carry local TV signals. But <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said the current system amounts to an `` undue and unwarranted subsidy for the cable industry,'' particularly since cable companies are no longer required to carry local broadcast signals. Requiring cable companies to negotiate with copyright holders would establish a system of prices that more closely reflects the value of programming to viewers, he said. It also would raise of price of some programming, which would likely increase the rates paid by cable subscribers. <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> officials could not estimate the financial impact, but they said that while prices might rise, the cable menu of programs would likely be more attractive to viewers. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> opposes elimination of the compulsory license, and in a statement noted that before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourned last week it extended the license for distant signals to backyard dish owners. The recommendation was reached with some difficulty by the three sitting <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> commissioners. Commissioner <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quello </PERSON> refused to go along with <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> to expand the recommendation to cover local TV signals and Commissioner <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> withheld her vote on the entire matter until she was fully satisfied with the tone and conclusions of the agency's report. She said, however, that once her concerns are met, she would probably vote that the recommendation cover both local and distant signals.

 Wrestler King <PERSON> Haku </PERSON> suffered two blows in just one day: a loss to <PERSON> Hulk </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> and notice he'd been sued for $ 1.1 million for allegedly trying to bite the nose off a bar patron. The wrestler's attorney, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Summers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, said by telephone Thursday afternoon that he has n't seen the lawsuit, so he could n't comment on it. He said, however, that `` there were other witnesses there with different stories about what happened.'' He also noted there are pending criminal charges. King <PERSON> Haku </PERSON> recently had a lavish televised coronation in the ring complete with red-velvet throne, golden crown and ermine-trimmed robe. The alleged incident involving the 29-year-old <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> bad-guy wrestler occurred June 26. He was charged with biting <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> of Relay and assaulting <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanko </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of Severn, the doorman at the <ORGANIZATION> Safari </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in the International Hotel. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s lawyer, filed the lawsuit in <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in August, but notice was not served on the 6-foot-2, 270-pound wrestler until he returned to <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> on Tuesday.

 A couple who believes a child they have never met is their daughter are prepared to push ahead with a courtroom custody battle if necessary, their lawyer said Thursday. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mays </PERSON>, a 43-year-old <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> roofing supply salesman, revealed that he has told his 9-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON>, of the claims of <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Langhorne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>. The Twiggs say their healthy newborn was switched for a sickly infant at <ORGANIZATION> Hardee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wauchula </LOCATION>, and then hospital records were altered to cover up the baby-selling scheme. The child they took home from the hospital, <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON>, died of a heart defect in August, after genetic testing that revealed she could not have been their biological daughter. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Blakely </PERSON>, the couple's <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> attorney, said, `` If <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> is their daughter, they do not know of any fact at this time that would cause them not to pursue custody of their child. `` They are simply driven by their natural paternal and maternal instincts to pursue and protect their own offspring.'' The Twiggs already have asked a <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> court to order a genetic blood test, a sophisticated scientific means of determining parentage. No hearing has been set. <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> has vowed to fight any effort to remove the child. The Twiggs are disturbed that <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> told <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> and are unhappy that he held a news conference and publicly revealed their identities, <PERSON> Blakely </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mays </PERSON>' identity had been known to reporters, who withheld it in order to protect the girl. `` Mr. and Mrs. <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> are upset that Mr. <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> talked to <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> without first talking to them. At this point they believe <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> is their daughter,'' their attorney said. `` If there's been no genetic testing done ... why expose her to that news before confirmation is obtained?'' <PERSON> Mays </PERSON>, whose first wife, <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON>'s mother, died and who is divorced from his second wife, said he told <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> about the dispute because he was afraid she'd learn of it from a stranger.

<HEAD>Arrest Dozens of Dissidents Who Called Unofficial Rally</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities detained dozens of dissidents in pre-dawn raids and tightened security in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> Thursday at the first official communist celebration of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s prewar independence. Hundreds of policemen and members of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Militia </ORGANIZATION>, a paramilitary force, cordoned off the center of <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, where tens of thousands massed behind red flags and in organized groups for the official rally to mark the anniversary of independence. Authorities banned an independent rally called for Friday by signatories of the human rights document Charter 77 and four other dissident groups. A dissident source who asked not to be identified said about 50 activists were detained in police raids early Thursday, including dissident playwright <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>; <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> activist <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Benda </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Petr </PERSON> <PERSON> Uhl </PERSON>, a monitor of political harassment in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. At least 15 other activists were reported under house arrest, the source said. In <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> quoted Czechoslovak activists as saying 122 people were detained throughout <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. That report could not be independently confirmed in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. To mark the 70th anniversary of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s independence, authorities announced a limited amnesty freeing prisoners serving less than two years, or less than three years in the case of crimes committed through negligence. The state news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> did not specify whether the amnesty included the estimated 70 political prisoners in Czechoslovak jails. But a legal source suggested the measure could apply to some first-time political offenders. The ban on the unofficial rally followed a protest march by thousands of people in August on the 20th anniversary of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion that crushed reforms. <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> residents said the march had clearly unnerved the authorities. <ORGANIZATION> Prague </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> boss <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON> delivered a stern warning at Thursday's rally that unofficial groups will not be tolerated. `` We wo n't allow the process of restructuring and democratization to be abused by those who do n't care for Socialism and their homeland ... those who are trying to destabilize society,'' <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON> said. `` There is no dialogue here,'' he added. His warning echoed similar speeches by <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> and chief ideologist <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fojtik </PERSON> at a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> meeting Oct. 10-12 that signaled <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> will not make sweeping political or economic reforms or follow neighboring <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> into toleration of independent groups. Earlier Thursday, hundreds of people joined an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> tribute to <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrigue </PERSON> <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON>, the president and founder of the <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> republic </ORGANIZATION>, which was set up on Oct. 28, 1918. Communist authorities proclaimed Friday a national holiday this year, reviving a custom in force for three years in the late 1960s, but otherwise ignored in four decades of socialist rule. The authorites scheduled the mass rally for Thursday in order to allow citizens to enjoy a three-day weekend. About 300 people jammed the front of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> to sing anthems and listen to an emotional rendering of a patriotic poem. Afterward, they burst into applause and shouted `` Thank you! Thank you!'' to <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Julkian </PERSON> <PERSON> Niemczyk </PERSON> and other American diplomats. Dozens of people stuck bouquets on to wall plaques showing <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON>, his Slovak ally <PERSON> Milan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rastislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Stefanik </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Woodrow </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, who backed their campaign for Dzechoslovak independence. Officials representing the presidency, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and the communist-led <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> laid wreaths on <PERSON> Masaruyk </PERSON>'s grave for the first time since the liberal era of 1968. Only about 100 people attended the barely publicized ceremony at <LOCATION> Lany </LOCATION>, 30 miles west of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON> and other Czechoslovak nationalists proclaimed the democratic republic in the waning days of World War I. A respected philosopher, <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON> was four times elected president of democratic <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> before his death in 1937. In 1938, the nation he built was dismembered when the <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> Pact between <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> allowed the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> to occupy <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s German-speaking territories.

But the tough police operation mounted for the occasion indicated the ruling Politburo does n't intend to swerve from the course it has charted in the 20 years since Soviet and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact tanks crushed the `` Prague Spring'' reforms.

 Thousands of people turned out today for the first official communist celebration of the nation's independence in 1918 Hundreds of policemen cordoned off downtown <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, where spectators massed behind red flags and slogans that sought to link the pre-World War II democracy to today's communist republic. Also today, hundreds of people joined an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> tribute to the founder and president of pre-Communist <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Seven prominent signatories of the Charter 77 human rights document, including dissident playwright <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> activist <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Benda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Petr </PERSON> <PERSON> Uhl </PERSON> were detained early today, according to dissident sources. <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dvorak </PERSON>, a prominent peace activist, and at least five other young activists also were detained, said the sources who demanded anonymity. The anniversary of independence in 1918 falls on Friday, but officials decided to hold the rally one day early. Authorities banned an independent rally called for Friday and warned citizens not to attend. However, for the first time in four decades of rule, communist authorities proclaimed Oct. 28 a national holiday. About 300 people crowded into the entranceway of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy today for an American-hosted ceremony honoring <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrigue </PERSON> <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON>, founder and president of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s democracy. Once reviled by the communist authorities, <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON> remains a potent national symbol for most Czechoslovaks. <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON>'s granddaughter <PERSON> Herberta </PERSON> was among the crowd who sang anthems and listened to a stirring patriotic poem before bursting into applause and calling to the American hosts in Czech, `` Thank you, thank you.'' Bouquets were placed on and around a plaque showing <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON>, his Slovak ally <PERSON> Milan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rastislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Stefanik </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Woodrow </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, who helped them win independence for <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Dozens of people crowded round <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Niemczyk </PERSON> after the 20-minute ceremony to thank him for the event, which takes place each year. Elsewhere, for the first time since 1968 when the Communist-led `` Prague Spring'' reforms still held sway, officials laid three wreaths on <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON>'s grave at <LOCATION> Lany </LOCATION>, 30 miles west of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. Only about 100 local villagers attended the low-key ceremony which, unlike other official events, was little publicized in advance. <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON> is buried near his country residence of <PERSON> Lany </PERSON> with his American-born wife <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> and their son <PERSON> Jan </PERSON>, a former foreign minister who died under mysterious circumstances just after the Communist takeover in 1948. With the backing of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON> and other campaigners for Czechoslovak independence proclaimed a democratic republic on Oct. 28, 1918. World War I was coming to an end, and the giant Austro-Hungarian empire of which <LOCATION> Slovakia </LOCATION> and the Czech lands of <LOCATION> Bohemia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moravia </LOCATION> were part was on the verge of breaking up. <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON> was four times elected president of democratic <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> before his death in 1937. In 1938, the nation he built was dismembered by the <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> Pact, which allowed the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> to march into <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s German-speaking territories At a ceremony at <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hradcany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Castle </ORGANIZATION>, the current president, <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>, lauded <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON> as a figure of authority at home and abroad in his time. But, according to a text of his speech from the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION>, he made no mention of <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON>'s role as a democratic philosopher and did not refer to the kind of government <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON> and his colleagues founded. Western diplomats invited to the ceremony had said <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> would speak. But <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> said no speech by <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> was expected.

 The local <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> president, threatened with suspension by her national headquarters, reluctantly retracted on Thursday her day-old endorsement of Republican presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, had disavowed the endorsements by Columbus chapter president <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and demanded a retraction by late Thursday. Hooks said the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> is a non-partisan organization whose bylaws forbid political endorsements. Ms. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said she stood by her endorsements but agreed to Hooks' demand for a retraction to avoid jeopardizing the chapter's tax-exempt status as a non-profit organization `` I felt that a message needed to be sent to the black community of the impending danger of supporting one political party,'' she said in an telephone interview. `` I believe that in order for progress to take place for blacks, they must be intricately involved in the entire political process, which includes involvement in both political parties.'' Hooks said Ms. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> was told in a telegram and a telephone call Thursday `` to issue a public statement repudiating, in its entirety, this position immediately upon receipt of this communication.'' `` Failure to do so will result in your immediate suspension,'' she was told. <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> also condemned the endorsements, made in a news release issued Wednesday under the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>'s letterhead. In that statement, Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> `` does not give political endorsements ... -LRB- but -RRB- we must offer support to those persons who hold political offices, or are seeking such offices, whose ideals, activities, practices or policies are in the best interest of minorities.'' <PERSON> Cornell </PERSON> <PERSON> McClearly </PERSON>, vice president of the Columbus chapter, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday that the decision to endorse <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> was prompted by a belief that loyalty solely to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was `` totally counterproductive.''

 `` E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'' soared into the stratosphere Thursday, the first day of the movie's release on videocassette. `` Nobody's buying just one,'' said <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Boswell </PERSON>, manager of Tower Video. `` I had one customer come in and buy 120 cassettes.

Demand has been so great that <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> Home Video, the video's packager, has been unable to fill orders Some retailers will receive only 75 percent of their requests. <PERSON> Boswell </PERSON> said she ordered 2,500 cassettes, expected 1,700 but received only 1,200. In any case, <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, could enjoy revenues of close to $ 200 million from the `` E.T.'' sales.

There is no Pepsi commercial on the video itself. Most movies are released within six months of their opening in movie theaters. `` E.T.,'' released in 1982, has never been shown on broadcast or cable television. The video release of the movie was delayed because <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON>, the film's director and producer, told Universal several years ago that he wanted the cassettes to be affordable. The previous low price for a major video release was last year's `` Top Gun,'' which sold for $ 26.95 About 3 million `` Top Gun'' cassettes were bought. `` Cinderella,'' which has sold more than 5 million copies in the last month, is priced at $ 26.99.

<HEAD>Trend Toward SIDS In White Males May Bear Watching, CDC Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Sudden infant death syndrome continues to be a leading cause of premature mortality, and an increase among white male infants may signal an important trend, federal health officials said Thursday. SIDS, which strikes about one in 500 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> infants, ranks seventh among causes of premature mortality in the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>'s tabulations of `` years of potential life lost.'' Unintentional injuries rank first. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> measures the loss of `` potential life'' _ in deaths before age 65 _ as a means of gauging the effects of premature mortality. Age 65 is a statistical benchmark; actual <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> life expectancy today is higher. During 1980-83, SIDS robbed white male infants of `` potential life'' at the rate of 97 years per 1,000 births, while the rate for females was 65. By 1984-85, the rate for white male babies had risen to 100, while the females' rate had fallen to 61. The rate for black males fell from 185 to 167, and the rate for black females fell from 151 to 134. `` The slight increases ... among white males ... should be monitored, to determine a possible emerging trend,'' the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said in its weekly report. The increase might be attributed to one of two factors, said Dr. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Becerra </PERSON>, a SIDS specialist with the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>. `` It could be due either to increased incidence of SIDS, or a decrease in age at death, in this -LRB- white male -RRB- group,'' he said. If white male SIDS babies were, for some reason, dying younger than other SIDS babies, their `` years of potential life lost'' _ before 65 _ would thus be higher, <PERSON> Becerra </PERSON> explained. In actual terms, SIDS would also seem to be on the increase among white males. In 1984, 2,295 SIDS deaths were reported among white baby boys, rising to 2,390 in 1985. Over the same period, white female SIDS cases increased by just six from 1,361 to 1,367, black male cases fell from 799 to 775 and black female cases fell from 640 to 582. Overall, 5,245 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> SIDS cases were reported in 1984 and 5,315 in'85, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> noted. The mystery surrounding SIDS _ defined as `` the sudden death of an infant,'' unexpectedly and without `` an adequate cause of death,'' also contributes to the uncertainty in studying it, <PERSON> Becerra </PERSON> said. In 1985, about 93 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> SIDS deaths were confirmed by autopsy, but that leaves `` a substantial number where no autopsy was made, so the diagnosis is in doubt,'' he said.

 Two murder convicts took a counselor and a teacher hostage today in the library of Northern State Prison, but released both of them unharmed and surrendered within several hours, authorities said. The incident ended about 4 p.m. when the inmates released the second hostage, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, 51, of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>. About 2 -LCB- hours earlier, the two men had freed <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 46, also of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>. Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> said the women were uninjured and that inmates <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON>, 26, and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 27, surrendered peacefully after releasing their hostages. They had been armed with homemade, spear-like weapons. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, a teacher assistant, and <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, a counselor, were taken hostage shortly after 9 a.m. while they conducted a teaching session in the library of the year-old Northern State Prison. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stabile </PERSON>, spokesman for the corrections department, said the two inmates' only demands were that they be transferred to a federal prison outside <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and that officials take no reprisals because of the hostage taking. <PERSON> Stabile </PERSON> described the inmates' weapons as long, metal rods with sharpened points. Earlier, negotiators talked through a meshed metal window to the inmates who used <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> as a shield. `` The hostage was right in front of the window between the inmate and the window with a metal rod pointed right at her head or her neck,'' <PERSON> Stabile </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON>, formerly of <LOCATION> Woodbine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, was sentenced in 1982 to 17 years in prison for shooting his uncle to death over a $ 70 debt in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> May </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, formerly of <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, was sentenced to life in prison in 1979 for a murder in <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Prison records showed both men had records of assaulting fellow inmates. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> is a vocational counselor who has worked at the prison for about a year. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> is a teaching assistant who started working at the prison in March. Both women are from <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>. The $ 18 million <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> opened last year, making it the newest prison in the state. The medium security prison houses about 1,000 inmates at the $ 18 million prison in individual cells. After the women were taken hostage, authorities locked the other inmates in their cells and called in the state's special operations group, which consists of negotiators, emergency rescue crews and a heavily-armed, black uniformed assault team. Warden <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON>, the assistant state commissioner for adult institutions, were leading the negotiating team.

He said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> insists the term fits only those actually charged with political offenses, while <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> says it also should include those jailed on `` trumped-up charges.'' `` We've long pressed for the release of Soviet political prisoners,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> told reporters. `` The Soviets finally accept that there are such prisoners, but we continue to disagree on a definition.'' He said Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials during a visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last month that there were only about 40 such prisoners, all of whom had been convicted for violations of the political and religious articles of the Soviet criminal code. But <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have raised with the Soviets the names of some 200 prisoners, including those jailed on fabricated charges. West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Wednesday that he had been assured in talks with Soviet officials that all political prisoners would be released within 10 weeks. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, refused to confirm or deny that a release of political prisoners is imminent, saying there are only about two dozen such prisoners. `` The recent remarks made to Chancellor <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> are an indication that all political prisoners will be released,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. `` But Mr. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>'s statement, which followed that, leads us to believe that the Soviets may be referring only to the 40-some prisoners raised during <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s visit in September here.'' Responding to questions, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said he believed that about half of those 40 prisoners had been released in recent weeks leaving only about 20 or so on the Soviet list.

 <PERSON> Lenore </PERSON>, 25, tips the scales at 230 while her friend, Terra, weighs in at 275 pounds. These simian grand dames need a fat farm _ and fast, say medical experts at Lincoln Park Zoo. But just how do you tell a lady gorilla she's too fat? Very carefully. An even trickier question: How do you get her to eat low-fat fare while the rest of her pals are getting the usual? Veterinarians, borrowing from the human fitness craze, are using body composition analysis and blood tests to determine just how big is too big for six lowland gorillas that call Lincoln Park their home. The study is spurred by concerns that a matronly gorilla may have some difficulty becoming a mom, chief zoo veterinarian <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON> said this week. Members of the zoo staff noticed that the youngest, slimmest and trimmest of the female gorillas were better reproducers. But until the veterinarians finish analyzing test results in several weeks, they are n't sure whether other gorillas are fat because they're old, not conceiving offspring because they're fat or old, or all of the above.

 Brawny athletes quaked in their tennis shoes and female volleyball players ran out screaming as sparrow-sized bats swooped through the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> gymnasium. `` We've got guys who are 6-foot-8 and 230 pounds ...,'' said basketball coach <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. `` I bet the bats do n't weigh an ounce.'' The harmless bug-eating bats, which have a wingspan of about six inches, were some of the thousands displaced from inside the ceiling of an education complex, which includes the gym, over the weekend. The bats were discovered in May, but because they were breeding, officials decided to wait until Friday to block the entry holes to their ceiling homes. Some of the bats unexpectedly flew into the gym this week, apparently through open doors, and `` our girls went crazy. They were screaming and running,'' said women's coach <PERSON> Bev </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>. The men did no better. One player crawled on the floor to avoid a dive-bombing bat. Others kept one eye on the bats and another on the basketball. After all the commotion Wednesday, student <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeiser </PERSON> was designated as bat-catcher. He waited until the bats landed, then threw a towel over them and took them outside. He caught five Wednesday.

 Demands for improved safety procedures at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear weapons-making plants mounted Thursday as 31 members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> appealed directly to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` This crisis has not arisen suddenly but over a long period, and it stems from inadequate attention to maintenance, safety and operating conditions,'' the lawmakers said in a companion letter to Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>. The letters, drafted by Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Spratt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, and signed by committee chairman <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., urged <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to appoint quickly the five-member <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ordered created this fall to oversee the troubled weapons complex The lawmakers expressed particular concern over the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s last three operational weapons production reactors have been shut down for safety reasons. The first will not resume producing nuclear weapons material until January, <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials have said. `` We will expect the department not to restart a reactor befor assuring our committee that the applicable operating procedures assure an adequate margin of safety,'' they said in the letter to <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>. National security adviser <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, answering questions Thursday during an appearance at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, said resolving the problems was `` a top priority'' in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. But he added that `` this is going to take more than a few slogans. ... It's going to take a lot of money.'' `` There are no magic-bullet solutions,'' he said. `` These problems developed over a long period of time. We did not make the necessary investment during the'50s and'60s to upgrade these aging facilities.'' Four of <PERSON> DOE </PERSON>'s 17 sites have been partially or wholly shut down this year over safety concerns, prompting hearings before <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panels. On Wednesday, a nationwide anti-nuclear group, Physicians for Social Responsibility, said the problems `` constitute a public health emergency,'' and urged medical studies on cancer rates among workers and neighbors of the plants. In other developments, government documents obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> show that the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> gave a manager of the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> $ 59,750 in awards for excellence despite continuing problems there. The manager, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, who retired early this year, is one of many individuals and organizations that received cash bonuses totaling millions of dollars despite a steady decline in safety at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which is a weapons production facility run by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for the Pentagon. A DOE spokesman, <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Callicott </PERSON>, said he was not aware of any plans to review the system of awards. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> received the bonuses in 1981-1987 despite growing safety problems which finally forced the department this year to shut down the reactors at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> documents and <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> testimony. The three reactors began operating in 1954. Memoranda in 1987 and 1988 document the failure of department officials to persuade <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> to implement safety guidelines. On Oct. 16, 1987, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, then the assistant energy secretary for environment, safety and health, wrote <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, then deputy assistant secretary, complaining they were not heeding an order for stricter operating procedures and evaluation of potential damage from an earthquake at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. `` The cited inability of SR -LRB- <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> -RRB- to adequately implement its safety oversight program, including sufficient day-to-day surveillance and deficiency follow-up, is unacceptable,'' wrote <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, who has since left the job. On March 21, 1988, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> sent a letter to <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s temporary successor, <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON>, saying that his `` office considers that the concerns raised are unfounded and feels that much misunderstanding exists within the Office of Environment, <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> in the area of SR seismic design and criteria.'' On May 20, 1988, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON>, who has assumed <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s duties, wrote a blistering letter to <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s successor, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaspar </PERSON> `` It appears that the seismic upgrading that has been accomplished -LRB- and is now under way -RRB- has been a piecemeal, largely reactive response and that planning, control and documentation have been seriously neglected,'' <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON> wrote. `` Criteria, analytical methods and analyses appear fragmented, incomplete and inconclusive,'' he wrote. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> was of many individuals and contractors who received cash awards for excellence at <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> nuclear facilities, despite mounting problems. Other such individuals cited in an Oct. 26, 1983, letter from Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on oversight and investigations, included: _ <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Roser </PERSON>, then assistant secretary, received $ 36,917 in bonuses 1980-83, although according to <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> he `` killed the independent assessment program which had been severely critical of his security program'' when he ran the department's regioffect when longer-term loans are agreed Economic forecaster <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> said the agreement would help <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> out of a short-term economic trap. An official of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, Mines and State-Owned Companies said <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has lost at least $ 2 billion in anticipated 1988 revenues because of the depressed oil market. Last year's oil revenues totaled about $ 8.6 billion. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s first-half merchandise trade surplus through June was $ 2.4 billion, well below 1987's first-half surplus of $ 4.76 billion, according to the Center for Private Economic Studies. The price of Isthmus, a major grade of light Mexican crude, dropped from $ 13.77 a barrel in August to $ 12.80 in September for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> customers; it was as high as $ 17.00 in December 1987. In 1985 and 1986, Isthmus went from $ 25 a barrel to $ 10. <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION>, the government oil monopoly, has sharply criticized the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries for overproduction and for indulging in an undeclared price war, especially in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market, <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION>'s largest customer. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the world's sixth-largest oil producer, does n't belong to <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> but usually follows its pricing policies. <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION>, however, said it did n't plan to join in price cutting and would not try to produce more to make up for lost revenue.

<HEAD>Philippines to Sue Westinghouse For Losses In Nuclear Power Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> will sue <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for building a $ 2.3-billion nuclear power plant that never went into operation because of alleged safety defects, a top presidential aide said Thursday. <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcuna </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s legal adviser, told reporters the suit was likely to be filed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` within a month.'' `` We are suing for damages and breach of contract,'' <PERSON> Azcuna </PERSON> said. He said other parties may be sued too but he declined to identify them. Construction of the plant began in the mid-1970s, with completion delayed by scandals involving alleged kickbacks to then-President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and questions about its safety. The plant was completed nearly three years ago, but Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government decided to junk it for reasons of safety Officials said the plant would have required hundreds of millions of dollars more for safety guarantees which her financially strapped government coult not afford. In addition to questions about its design, opponents of the plant, located on <LOCATION> Bataan </LOCATION> province 50 miles west west of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, say it sits on an earthquake fault and is near a volcano. After being rocked by the kickback scandal in 1978, construction was suspended for nearly a year while the plant's design was studied following the Three Mile Island accident. The re-evaluation ended in design modifications that further bloated the plant's cost. Much of the money for the plant came from foreign loans. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> administration officials often cite the plant as an example of the needless expenses incurred during the administration of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> which burdened the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> with a $ 28 billion foreign debt. Officials said that interest alone on the loans for the nuclear power plant totalled more than $ 300,000 a day. <PERSON> Azcuna </PERSON> told reporters the government decided to sue <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> failing to reach a settlement with the Pittsburgh-based company. `` The legal panel is studying the alternatives of filing the case either in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, and the probability is that it will be filed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` We have engaged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> counsel to help us in doing this and the timing would be very soon.'' Pressed by reporters for a date, <PERSON> Azcuna </PERSON> replied, `` It was about to be foiled last month, so I would say within a month.'' He refused to give more details of the suit. Other sources said the complaint wo n't cite any specific amount in damages and would leave it to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts. The Aquino government was under pressure two years ago to repudiate loans to the nuclear project, but it refused to do so for fear of possible backlash from foreign banks with which she is renegotiating her country's outstanding debts. Officials who asked not to be identified said that litigation was the safest way to deal with the problem especially because the government has convincing evidence that the plant is unsafe and its construction characterized by fraud.

 A proposal to draw up an international list of governments and experts willing to cooperate against airplane hijackers has won overwhelming approval from an international conference on aviation security, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s top aviation official said Thursday. Lord <PERSON> Brabazon </PERSON> of <PERSON> Tara </PERSON>, parliamentary undersecretary of state for aviation, said methods are being worked out by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` A hijacking is an attack on us all, an offense to us all, and a danger to us all and we must act collectively to diminish the risk and to lessen the consequences,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>.

Lord <PERSON> Brabazon </PERSON> noted the <ORGANIZATION> ICAO </ORGANIZATION> had also quickly taken up and approved the British position that a hijacked plane should not be refueled or allowed to take off unless that is necessary to protect human life. The idea was endorsed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and the leaders of six other major non-Communist governments at their meeting in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> last June.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has a new nightly TV show, and it can get pretty violent with its rioting hooligans, masked stone-throwers and battling tanks. It is n't the latest American cop show, but the nightly string of political campaign ads, a crucial tool in reaching undecided voters. Unlike in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where the presidential campaign is waged via the nightly news and periodic commercials, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> law bars state-run radio and television from covering candidates in the final month before the vote. Instead, the 27 parties competing for 120 Parliament seats are given free access to prime time TV to get their message across. Since the beginning of the month, the two-minute spots have been running back-to-back in 40-minute periods after the evening news. The commercials, ranging from slick to amateurish, feature some serious political debate, but more often use gimmicks, fancy graphics and, recently, nasty attacks on political rivals. Leaders of both the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, the main political rivals, say the rhetoric may get rougher before Tuesday's vote. In one ad this week, Labor called <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> leaders liars for allegedly forging polls, described their supporters as primitive hooligans, and tried to show the party as hopelessly divided. To make the point, the spot showed shouting <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> supporters smashing equipment at a rally. In the same ad, rival party leaders <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> were seen barking insults, with these clips intercut with cartoons of medieval knights charging at each other. The spot closed with a cartoon of a sinking ship interspersed with shots of a fist-pounding <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who called <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> a `` movement that fights for its existence.'' <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Milo </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s TV campaign, watched that ad Wednesday night and then told reporters: `` We'll get a little tougher in the next couple of days.'' <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> kept its promise Thursday night with a sharp attack on Labor leader <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>. `` Yesterday, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> showed what it thinks about <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>,'' said an announcer. `` We do n't want to tell you what we think about <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, but what Labor people say about him.'' The spot then flashed across the screen uncomplimentary quotes about <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> attributed to former Labor prime ministers, including founding father <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurion </PERSON>, who allegedly said of his protege: `` Do n't believe him, do n't get close to him.'' As the quotes were splashed across the screen, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' image appeared in a corner, his face contorted in various grimaces. In addition to personal attacks, the ads often appeal to the viewers' emotions, especially on the issue of <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace and how <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should deal with the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising. This week, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> showed a middle-aged widow who pleaded for a peace settlement so her teen-age son would not be killed in a war like his father. The next day, <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> hit back with an elderly <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Eldad </PERSON> <PERSON> Azkirelli </PERSON>, who lost a son in war. Addressing the war widow, <PERSON> Azkirelli </PERSON> said: `` I felt you were being used. ... I'm against involving bereaved families in the election campaign.'' To work out these responses, both parties employ `` focus groups'' _ voters representing the political spectrum who rate the ads every night. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> invites a different focus group of about 50 voters to its campaign headquarters every night. After viewing each ad, the voters push buttons ranking them on a scale of one to five. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> campaign strategist <PERSON> Binyamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> said the party decided to bring on the bereaved father because the focus group felt the spot with the war widow was a `` manipulation of grief.'' The big parties dominate the nightly show because air time is alloted according to representation in the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>, or Parliament. But the smaller parties get their shot, too. Some of the seven religious parties feature wailing ram horns and bearded rabbis speaking with almost evangelical fervor against the moral decay of Israeli society. One ad by the liberal <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> featured puppets arguing campaign issues, and a commercial for the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Crossroads </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> used a graphic in which the Star of <PERSON> David </PERSON> on the Israeli flag turns into the party symbol. Other ads have shown masked Palestinian stone-throwers, Israeli tanks in the field, and even <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> toting a gun. Some are critical of the ads, whose production costs use up a large chunk of the $ 30 million the parties spend on the campaign. `` They -LRB- the ads -RRB- are based on a common denominator of viewing the potential voter as infantile and retarded,'' wrote the daily <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION>. The ads may not be making their point either, considering that viewership dropped from more than 70 percent earlier this month to about 43 percent. But the commercials are still the most direct way to reach undecided voters, estimated at 8 percent of the electorate of 2.9 million, who are considered crucial to the outcome by both major parties.

 Politicians have come to understand that you have to be pretty quick to a punch line to hold a crowd, and on Thursday <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> fell victim _ for just a moment _ to an overenthusiastic supporter. In his stump speech, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate usually mentions that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has linked himself to former President <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>. This gives <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> a chance to parody <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and poke some fun at himself by delivering the remark, `` But he's no <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>.'' The reference is to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s debate putdown when <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> compared his experience to that of President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> _ <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said he had known <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and told <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, `` You're no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.'' At a fund-raising breakfast, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had been referring again to <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, but before he could deliver the punch line, a man in the audience shouted out, `` He's no <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>.'' That provoked laughter and left <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> momentarily stymied. But he barely missed a beat before pointing to the man and said, `` That man, he does n't know <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. He has never even served with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, but he's right. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is no <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>.''

 <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> shrugs off lingering questions about his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> service as `` side events,'' but has not entirely escaped the Vietnam-era issue. Along with admirers as <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> stumped through the South this week, there were naysayers. Signs reading `` Chickenhawk'' or `` Why Did <LOCATION> Quayle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cross </LOCATION> <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>: To Get to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'' have greeted him at rallies throughout the fall, and the resentment even spilled over to a self-described Republican who served among his local police contingent in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Wednesday. The policeman told a reporter he'd intended to vote for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> until <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tapped <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as his running mate. Now, the officer said, he will simply not vote on Nov. 8. He said he `` could n't believe'' he had to protect <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, whom he called `` a draft dodger. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> enlisted in the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> during the Vietnam War when many of his peers were being drafted. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has said he was not trying to avoid the draft, but simply chose a course that would allow him to attend law school while fulfilling his military obligation.

 At an earlier stop in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> let reporters know he had not forgotten the drubbing they gave him over his military service, his record as a mediocre student and other aspects of his background. He was given a blue `` static jacket'' to wear during a tour of a <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> plant where highly sensitive components for the Space Shuttle and Trident missile are made. Outside, the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator still had the jacket on when he addressed a rally. `` I was given this static jacket and I'm going to use it when I hold my next news conference,'' joked the senator, who currently enjoys mostly friendly relations with the press and often comes back on the plane to chat with them. Later, as he climbed the steps of his campaign plane, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> laughed down at the reporters watching him from the tarmac and waved the jacket, pointing to them. By the time most of the reporters came aboard from the back of the plane, the jacket was hanging from above the first row of press seating.

 Republicans and Democrats cried foul Thursday after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, despite a written pledge of support from his budget office, said he would veto a bill that would protect federal employees who blow the whistle on government wrongdoing. `` It's outrageous conduct and has created a bipartisan explosion, because it violates the basic understanding we need but now no longer have ... that an administration's word is good,'' said the chief <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sponsor of the bill, Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich. The president said he would `` pocket veto'' the bill _ let it die by refusing to sign it while <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is out of session. While the budget office pledged support for the bill, Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, whose objections led to the veto decision, said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had expressed its concerns about the legislation to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` as recently as a week or two ago. `` The constitutional objections that the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> conveyed to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had been consistently conveyed to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> throughout the course of consideration of this bill,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> told reporters. But on Oct. 3, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, wrote Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and chief <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> sponsor, Rep. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, D-Colo. `` I would like to congratulate you on the fine work you have done over the last eight months to develop the ` Whistleblower Protection Act of 1988,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> wrote <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> `` While this bill does not include everything we wanted, it will significantly improve protection for whistleblowers _ a goal which the administration shares with you.'' After citing specific strengths of the bill, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> concluded, `` These new authorities are significant and I would like to thank you personally for the repeated efforts you have made to work with the administration on developing S. 508. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> had passed the bill without a dissenting vote following months of negotiations between congressional sponsors and the administration. Disgruntled lawmakers said Thursday they thought the talks had produced a bill satisfactory to the administration. Asked whether the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had signed off on any compromise bill, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said: `` Not to my knowledge.'' Asked whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> got approval to make any deals with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said, `` I do n't know.'' <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> said he supported the bill `` only when I was assured of the administration's support.'' <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> called <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision `` a reprehensible act ... orchestrated after adjournment of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to prevent an override.'' `` We worked with the administration far too closely for <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and company to now suggest there are unresolved constitutional questions,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>. `` But then this administration has n't exactly a sterling record where whistleblowers are concerned.'' <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON> said he was `` outraged, though not completely surprised.'' One federal whistleblower, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kusen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, said of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision, `` I really thought it was a very bad move on his part. It makes me sick.'' She said the current lack of strong protection `` keeps people like myself from speaking out on fraud, waste and abuse. There's a lot of it around. I mean a ton of it.'' Ms. <PERSON> Kusen </PERSON>, a contract administrator for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contract </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said she was harassed and passed over for promotion after reporting some $ 8 million in overpricing by a contractor selling ship propulsion equipment to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. She said the Office of Special Counsel, which investigates federal whistleblower cases, took more than a year to investigate the retaliation. She said that before the inquiry could be completed, those she had accused of harassment left the agency and she dropped the complaint. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Wednesday the bill would have allowed employees `` who are not genuine whistleblowers'' to manipulate the process to delay or avoid proper discipline. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the bill would have caused constitutional problems because it would have allowed executive branch agencies to go to court against each other. The president has the power to resolve disputes between his subordinates, he said. `` I regret that the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did not present me with constitutional and effective legislation to expand the protections and procedural rights afforded to federal employees who report fraud, waste and abuse they discover in federal programs,'' the president said in a statement. `` The interests of both employees and managers should be fully protected,'' the president said. He pledged to submit his own bill in January when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> returns. Sponsors said the whistleblower bill was needed because the Office of Special Counsel, established to represent the interests of whistleblowers, was not doing its job. The bill would have made the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Counsel </ORGANIZATION> an independent agency and would have defined its role clearly as one of protecting whistleblowers. The office now is part of the <ORGANIZATION> Merit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and at times it has acted against whistleblowers who came to the office for help.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s national security adviser, <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, on Thursday credited Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for pushing economic reform, but said it `` remains to be seen'' how much improvement can be made under a communist, one-party system. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant general, said it has become clear, however, that the Soviets have chosen to pursue a policy of declining adventurism in foreign policy so they can focus `` energies and resources on internal economic reform.'' `` The bold new leadership in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has candidly acknowledged the problems the Soviet system faces,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said in a speech prepared for delivery to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. `` But the problems are fundamental, even structural.'' Soviet officials in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Thursday said they will begin liquidating unprofitable businesses and farms to bolster the nation's economy and overcome a budget deficit expected to reach $ 58 billion next year. Finance Minister <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gostev </PERSON> told the Supreme Soviet legislature that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s government is finding it difficult to bring deficit spending under control. In his speech, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> took his audience on a tour of world trouble spots, saying resistance forces fighting communism and totalitarians have made great strides in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said the push for freedom in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has lagged, at least in part because of divisions within the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on support for the Contra rebels. He said a principal lesson to be learned from the various regional conflicts is that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> foreign policy has tended to succeed in instances in which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support was unquestioned. He said this included <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, where the Soviets have begun pulling out forces that have occupied the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> nation since 1979 but were fought continuously by the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> resistance. `` The Soviets are correctly reassessing their past foreign policy, including their adventurism in the 1970s, as a series of mistakes,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said, because they and their allies were unable to consolidate their gains. `` One lesson here is that sometimes leaders have the wit to see the futility of war, to see diplomatic solutions,'' he said. `` But the deeper lesson is that effective resistance to aggression is what demonstrates the futility of war.'' Of the changing political climate in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, he said: `` Essentially, perestroika is an acknowledgment of the failure of the Soviet system to provide for its people. Whether it can be fixed as long as it remains a communist, one-party system remains to be seen.'' But <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> also said that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who recently took on the additional title of president of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> with the retirement of <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, is facing problems with `` restive nationalities in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and around the Soviet empire.'' This, he said, is going to `` preoccupy <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> more than anyone anticipated.'' `` There is little we can do to affect the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s internal evolution,'' said <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, who plans to resume his active duty military career when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s term ends Jan. 20. `` We can encourage steps that are clearly improvements in Soviet internal political practice, even if they do not correspond fully to what we know as democracy.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Wednesday voiced hope that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would free remaining political prisoners in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ as West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> had indicated following talks with Kremlin officials. `` Our adversaries face a systemic crisis,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. `` They sense that their system is wrong but they are seeking to fix it without changing it wholesale. It is not yet clear whether they can succeed.'' `` The immediate problem they're facing is an economic system that is not up to the demands of the 1990s and the 21st century,'' he said in answer to a question from the audience. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said the Soviets will be `` left behind'' in global economic competition `` unless they make the necessarty adjustments.''

 Seven Latin American presidents on Thursday demanded a `` new dialogue'' with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other developed lands on foreign debt, drug trafficking, strife in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and other topics. All suggested that foreign debts be renegotiated. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> alone owes $ 121 billion. Speaking forcefully and at times with bitterness and anger, the presidents said in separate speeches that their calls were prompted by economic stagnation at home and rising public discontent. They said they believe the developed countries, particularly the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, either contribute to their problems or can help in some way they have not so far attempted. President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> got a standing ovation when he said: `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people should know that a <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that is disunited is not a good neighbor, that a <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that is impoverished is not a good market.'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> spoke before an inaugural ceremony audience of about 500 diplomats and guests at the second meeting of the so-called Group of Eight _ now only seven minus <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Mexican President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> declared: `` Budget adjustments, austerity programs and economic stagnation have made the 1980s the lost decade -LRB- for many Latin American countries -RRB-.'' The Group of Eight was formed in 1986 to develop common positions on regional problems. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was suspended after Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the real power behind <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s elected civilian government, ousted elected President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> last February. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> currently are suffering severe bouts of inflation. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> have been hurt economically by falling world prices for oil. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> is engaged in a full-fledged battle against cocaine and marijuana traffickers. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> is battling a guerrilla insurgency. <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, with 3 million inhabitants, has a $ 6 billion foreign, one of the highest per capita debts in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other industrial nations could help, the presidents said, by renegotiating foreign debts to put a priority on economic growth in borrowing countries; by cracking down on users of illegal drugs; by reducing protectionist legislation that limits imports, and by helping promote a peaceful solution to conflict in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` It is necessary to put mechanisms in place in our region to reduce -LRB- interest -RRB- payments as well as procedures to prevent their re-escalation,'' said President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, those country is the developing world's most indebted nation. President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> said: `` Since January, 4,559 people involved in this crime -LRB- drug trafficking -RRB- have been arrested, 17,326 kilos of cocaine have been seized ... and 497,000 kilos of marijuana. We also have seized hundreds of weapons, thousands of kilos of ammunition, hundreds of vehicles, boats and planes ... `` Meanwhile ... in the capitals of developed nations, drugs circulate with startling ease. The civil liberties of consumers can not be considered more important than the stability of democracy in nations and the right to life of our judges, reporters, political leaders, union members, peasants and office holders.'' A kilogram equals 2.2 pounds. The seven presidents, seated at a long table on the stage of a municipal auditorium in this <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> resort town, all made short opening speeches. They then headed to the countryside for a traditional Uruguayan `` asado,'' or barbecue, before going into their first round of closed-door meetings. A joint communique was to be issued on Saturday. The presidents gave little indication what specific proposals might emerge in the communique. No president in his speech called for drastic, one-sided action such as withholding debt interest payments or linking repayments to a fixed figure, such as a percentage of export earnings. Foreign ministers of the member countries endorsed in April 1987 a proposal by President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> that called for disarming warring factions in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and a policy of non-intervention by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Argentine President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> said he was encouraged by the group's progress during the past two years. `` We are a new and necessary political personality on the world stage,'' he said.

 A bus from <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s motorcade collided Thursday with a school van carrying five children, but witnesses said there were no serious injuries. The vice presidential candidate was not aboard the campaign staff bus when it smashed into the side of the van, said Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Courter </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.J. </LOCATION>, who was on it along with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s aunt and mother and aides to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` We're fine,'' said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Corinne </PERSON>. <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> said the school bus driver appeared `` very shaken up.'' Police and ambulance crews tended to the children at the scene. Three students _ two girls and a boy _ and a driver were taken to nearby <LOCATION> Morristown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> for treatment of bumps and bruises and other minor injuries. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> took time to visit the students, all in their early teens, and said afterward `` they were all in very good spirits.'' <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> said the school bus `` pulled right out in front of us.''

 In the closing days of the presidential race, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> keeps telling audiences `` I'm running like I'm 10 points behind.'' Actually, he's running the play-it-safe, no-surprises campaign of a front-runner. Major polls indicate <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is well ahead of Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. And <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is not tampering with what has proven to be a successful formula of bashing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a diehard liberal who is weak on crime, soft on defense and apt to raise taxes. `` This election is far from over,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told an audience of several hundred people at a stockyard rally in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, S.D. `` You've seen those national surveys but let me tell you something. I am going to continue to run like I am 10 points behind, right down to the wire, standing on the issues. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added, `` I am determined to win this election. I am not going to let up. I am not going to refuse to campaign. I'll keep going as far and as fast as is required.'' At the same time, he's apparently also working to maximize Republican chances in several races for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where Democrats are trying to protect their current 54-46 advantage. He's visiting <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> on Saturday, a state where he holds a huge lead over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> but where GOP Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> trails in his re-election bid. He went to <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> on Wednesday, where he's in a close race but for a payoff of only four electoral votes. Republican <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> challenger <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> is trailing narrowly in private GOP surveys there. And <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s stop in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Thursday was designed not only to boost his own chances in a tight state, but also to help <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Slade </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorton </PERSON>, who is also locked in a tight race. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> acknowledges he's not going to try anything new in the homestretch of the campaign, and he has n't. He'll `` probably keep talking about the same themes that he's been talking about,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, who is <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff. Among the states where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is making appearances this week are <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> _ electoral giants crucial to the outcome of the Nov. 8 contest. `` We're going to focus on states where we think the support is soft, where the margin isclose,'' said <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>. `` We're pleased and encouraged by the polls but we are going to continue to work to make sure we've locked up the necessary electoral votes,'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said. Yet, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also shows up in places like <LOCATION> Williston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, where he told a firehouse rally, `` Things look pretty good nationally.'' The very fact that he was spending time in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, which offers a total of just three electoral votes, suggests <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is not worrying too much. He could have spent that time in big battleground states. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also went to <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> -LRB- 8 electoral votes -RRB-, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> -LRB- 3 -RRB- and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> -LRB- 4 -RRB-. Not because he needed them, but at least partly because they are states in <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' calculus of how to win the 270 electoral votes needed to capture the White House. `` Why not wreak havoc with that stratgy?'' said <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s national political director and deputy campaign manager `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> -RRB- has to take some states out of our political base and I would be hard-pressed to name one.'' Talking about his visit to Billings, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, after a stop earlier in the day in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` It shows that we are taking absolutely nothing for granted.'' At a strategy meeting after the Oct. 13 presidential debate in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told the senior staff that their biggest problem was to avoid overconfidence. Nevertheless, While <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was busy on the campaign trail last Sunday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was resting at home in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. So, too, was his running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Tentative plans call for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to be in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> again this Sunday, relaxing for the final eight-day push. Uncharacteristically, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made an effort in one speech this week to respond briefly to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' charges of lies and distortions in <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> campaign advertisements. Usually, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> just ignores <PERSON> Duckakis </PERSON>' attacks Having dealt with the issue once, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> quickly turned the job of responding over to a team of campaign advisers at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> news conference. Unlike <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> turned down an invitation to appear on a 90-minute session of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Nightline.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also has ignored similar interview bids from <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, which were grabbed up by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> offers are good until the election but she doubts the vice president will accept them. Borrowing a chapter from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s campaign book, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has largely insulated himself from the press, minimizing chances for miscues and gaffes that would detract from his campaign message. Typically <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> makes three campaign appearances a day. The first event usually is the one that provides the latest twist on a well-worn book of political rhetoric and attack lines. The second and third events of the day usually are rallies where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> delivers his time-tested stump speech with lines such as, `` The liberal governor is simply out of step with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. My values are your values.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> quickly follows up by attacking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on hot-button issues: gun control, the death penalty, abortion, the Pledge of Allegiance, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' membership in the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>.

 Israeli soldiers killed a teen-ager and wounded 20 other Palestinians during street confrontations Thursday in the occupied lands, hospital officials and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> journalists reported. Officials at <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> hospital in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said 16-year-old <PERSON> Zyad </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabit </PERSON> was shot in the heart at the Nuseirat refugee camp. At least 304 Palestinians and six Israelis have died since a rebellion against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation began last Dec. 8 among the 1.5 million Palestinians of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 war. The immediate cause of violence in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> was the death Wednesday of a 3-year-old whose parents said she was suffocated by tear gas. The army however said <PERSON> Narin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON> <PERSON> An-Nahajha </PERSON> died of pneumonia. Dozens of young Palestinians set tires ablaze and threw stones at <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers in <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON>, where <PERSON> Narin </PERSON> died. Troops responded with plastic bullets, wounding three teen-agers and three women, said officials at <LOCATION> Nasser </LOCATION> hospital in the city. Plastic bullets wounded two Palestinians during a stone-throwing melee on <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, hospital officials said. The army confirmed three wounded in <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> and a spokesman said he was aware `` there could be more casualties. It was n't quiet today in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>.'' But <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s chief of staff, Lt.

 The nation's 60,000 striking public employees defied a presidential back-to-work order Thursday, workers at U.S.-owned banana plantations began a sympathy walkout and students boycotted classes. President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> declared the strike illegal and offered the workers better benefits, which they turned down. It is the first nationwide strike by public employees in this Central American country of 5 million people. Soldiers guarded closed government offices but the military said it would not use force against the workers, who began the strike Wednesday. Government hospitals were closed and only about 40 percent of buses and taxis were operating. Secondary school and university students cut classes and 8,000 workers stayed away from their jobs at two banana plantations owned by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> fruit company. <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> ordered the strikers back to work after an emergency Cabinet meeting. The <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON>'s offer was inadequate Association president <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Obdulio </PERSON> <PERSON> Chevez </PERSON> told reporters the strike would continue until all union demands were met. The workers want raises, paid vacations, job security, Christmas bonuses and an extra month's pay every year. The union has not said how large the raises should be for its members, who now are paid an average $ 500 a month. <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> appeared caught between the strikers and a legislature hostile to their demands. He offered job security and paid vacations but <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON>, president of the legislature, said <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> had no business promising something he could not deliver.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign said Thursday it is doubling its budget for Hispanic ads, with most of the money earmarked for a radio blitz in seven states with large and still fluid Hispanic voter populations. The announcement from Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.M. </LOCATION>, heading the Democratic presidential nominee's drive for Hispanic votes, came the same day <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> began urging a vote for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in spots on radio stations with black listeners. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign is spending about $ 3 million _ 10 percent of its media budget _ on black-oriented television and radio advertising which began three weeks ago. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has recorded five radio ads. `` We have the power to make <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> president. Let's use it,'' he says in one of them. `` More people have fallen into the deep hole of poverty because of Republican policies,'' he says in another. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who is fluent in Spanish, started running TV ads in Spanish on two national Hispanic networks, <ORGANIZATION> Univision </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Telemundo </ORGANIZATION>, last week. One stresses education, another drugs and a third his immigrant heritage. All three end with the tagline, `` He speaks our language.'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said Thursday the Hispanic ad budget will be expanded from $ 500,000 to $ 1 million. He said three-quarters of the new money will go for radio saturation in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. The three new spots were scheduled to start Friday. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign believes Hispanics can provide the margin of victory Nov. 8 if they turn out in force and vote Democratic. But Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is counting on Cuban-American support in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and is not ceding Hispanic votes elsewhere. The new <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> radio offensive does not include <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> holds a huge lead and <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has had trouble making inroads with Cuban-American voters. And <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was scheduled Friday to receive the endorsement of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Informador </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hispano </LOCATION>, a Hispanic newspaper in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. The endorsement editorial praised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for being `` tough on crime and drug dealers.'' It also says that `` like most Hispanics, he believes abortion is wrong except in case of rape or danger to the mother's life. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is running a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> TV ad featuring his Hispanic daughter-in-law <PERSON> Columba </PERSON>, who is married to his son <PERSON> Jeb </PERSON>, and the couple's three children. The ad, running in both English and Spanish, concludes with the vice president saying he'll `` have a lot of reasons to help Hispanics everywhere, because I'll not only be answering to my grandchildren, I'll be answering to history.'' In other media developments: _ Four new <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spots unveiled earlier this week, combining a populist `` on your side'' pitch with the vow that `` the best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is yet to come,'' started Thursday in spot markets across the country _ The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said it had begun airing two ads aimed at turning out younger voters for the Democratic ticket The spots in markets around the state attack the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> record on education and the environment. _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> said the campaign had temporarily shelved a 60-second version of a 30-second `` tank'' ad mocking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' tank ride photo opportunity as a narrator lists weapons systems allegedly opposed by the Democrat <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> called the expanded version `` devastating'' and said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who holds a double-digit lead in most polls, would not bring out the `` heavy artillery'' unless it is needed.

 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> demanded Thursday that talks between the government and opposition begin without preconditions and called on the authorities to clarify the prospects for union pluralism. `` We demand that talks begin without preconditions and without intervention, but we can not open the talks at any price,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said at a news conference. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> met earlier with three of his most senior Solidarity advisers, one of whom expressed doubt over the future of the talks, which are to consider the future of the banned union and broader issues of political and economic reform. `` I must say that today I am very pessimistic. I could say that perhaps the round table is over without a start. But you know that in all countries everything can change,'' said <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Stelmachowski </PERSON>, a law professor and opposition mediator. Government objections to two members of the Solidarity delegation delayed the start of the talks. But <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said again Thursday he would not change his team. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> on Tuesday refused a government demand he meet with Interior Minister Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> to clear final obstacles to the talks. The government said they could begin Friday if <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> agreed to meet <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stelmachowski </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> was asked Thursday to make a statement declaring the government's intentions on the prospects for pluralism and the future of Solidarity. `` This morning they refused to make such a declaration. The situation is very bad,'' <PERSON> Stelmachowski </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> noted a change in the authorities' attitude toward the talks. `` I see a lack of political will to solve the problems that divide us.'' he said. He agreed to take part in the talks at a meeting with <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> on Aug. 31 while strikes continued in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s worst labor unrest in seven years. After being guaranteed the talks would include the subject of Solidarity's future, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> called a halt to the strikes. He had joined striking workers at the <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> shipyard during the first strike wave in April and again in August. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> accused the authorities of bad faith by failing to reinstate more than 100 miners fired in the <LOCATION> Silesia </LOCATION> region after strikes in mid-August. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> carried an <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement saying <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> had urged managements to rehire dismissed workers and asked prosecutors to drop proceedings against strike leaders. It said he was `` urgently'' collecting information about individual cases brought to his attention by the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. `` This proves that no ` political repressions' are being used.. and the appeals of Gen. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> are being gradually implemented,'' the ministry declared. In response to questions, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said more strikes are possible unless the workers are rehired and the promise of round-table talks is fulfilled. `` People who were fighting then are ready now again,'' he said. `` I am ready to jump over the fence for the third time although we do n't want it.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> also complained about government attempts to interfere in the composition of Solidarity's delegation. The government has objected to the participation of regime critics <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON>, whom it says do not respect <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s constitutional order which guarantees a `` leading role'' of the communist party. Government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> on Tuesday called on the two men to publically declare their respect for the constitutional order. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has refused to drop the two men from his team. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> met Thurdsay with historian <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> and journalist <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> in addition to <PERSON> Stelmachowski </PERSON>. The advisers say it seems the real obstacle is not the particpants, but the authorities' lack of clarity on the future of Solidarity. `` What <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said at the beginning means all the problems are blocked because there is no answer to the basic question. It's not the pretext, but the question of the lack of political will to solve the central problem of the legalization of Solidarity,'' <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and his advisers appear worried that chances for the talks are diminishing as time elapses. `` We have no time and we do n't want empty words ... Talks are already late.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. A communique earlier this week said the Politburo was committed to the talks and expressed hope that `` remaining controversies will be quickly removed in the course of preparatory talks.'' Urban's office did not return a phone call requesting comment on the future of the talks.

 Two convicted murderers held hostage a counselor and a teacher's aide at a state prison for several hours Thursday in an attempt to get transferred to another prison, authorities said. Both hostages were released unharmed and the inmates, armed with sharpened metal rods, surrendered peacefully, said Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 46, a teaching assistant, and <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, 51, a vocational counselor, both of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, were taken hostage at 9:07 a.m. as they conducted a teaching demonstration in the library of the year-old Northern State Prison. Mrs. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> was released at 1:34 p.m. and Ms. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> was taken from the library on a stretcher at 4:06 p.m., ending nearly seven hours as a hostage. Negotiators spent hours talking through a metal mesh window to the inmates, who used the women as shields. `` There were repeated threats that they were prepared to do violence to the hostages,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON>, deputy corrections commissioner. He said the women were `` emotionally battered'' but not physically harmed. The only demands from inmates <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON>, 26, and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 27, were that they be transferred to a federal prison outside <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and that officials take no reprisals for the hostage taking, said Corrections spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stabile </PERSON>. `` The negotiators agreed that the grievances of the two inmates would be reviewed,'' <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> also asked to be allowed to call his mother, a demand <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> said would be granted. He said <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> will be transferred Thursday to another state prison. Mrs. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON>, said in a telephone interview that he learned of his wife's plight from a noon radio broadcast. `` I just had to pray that it would come to a happy ending,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> described the inmates as longtime friends who had been imprisoned at Riverfront State Prison in <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION> before being transferred to <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> about two weeks ago. <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Woodbine </LOCATION> was sentenced to 17 years in prison in 1982 for murdering his uncle during an argument over $ 70. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION> was sentenced to life in prison in 1979 for shooting his victim in the back of the head. Prison records did not give details of the case. Northern State Prison is a medium security prison that holds about 1,000 inmates in six two-story units. The $ 18 million complex opened in May 1987. <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Sharpe </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, who went to the prison after learning of the hostage taking, said he was unaware that the lockup housed murderers. The state has two maximum security prisons near <LOCATION> Rahway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> said it was not unusual for murderers to be kept at a medium security prison.

 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, co-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, has told business executives that he believes his panel will support a $ 120 billion deficit reduction package split evenly between budget cuts and increased taxes, one of the executives said Thursday. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> told the business leaders at a dinner in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Wednesday that `` he thinks he has nine votes'' on the 12-member commission for a combination of $ 60 billion in government spending cuts and $ 60 billion in tax increases to close the budget gap. However, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON>, a spokesman for the commission, quoted <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> as terming <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON>'s version of the meeting `` totally inaccurate.'' `` All he said at the dinner was that the most support he could hope to get for any program would probably be eight or nine votes out of the current 12 members,'' <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> said. `` But he denies saying in any way, shape or form what the final package will be.'' The commission was created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to come up with recommendations on eliminating the federal budget deficit, which totaled an estimated $ 150 billion for the fiscal year which ended Sept. 30. The commission hopes to begin taking votes on different options after the Nov. 8 election when the president-elect will name the final two members to the panel. The panel has set a deadline of finishing its work by Dec. 21. <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON>, president of an association of 500,000 small businesses, told reporters at a briefing Thursday that <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> had indicated he believed the commission would approve a deficit reduction package amounting to $ 120 billion split evenly between increased taxes and budget cuts. <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> said he personally supported a vale added tax as a way of raising revenues. The VAT, which has been adopted by several <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries, is a form of sales tax. The tax is added to a product at various stages of the production process. A 5 percent value added tax could raise an estimated $ 50 billion in new revenues annually. <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON> said his group was adamantly opposed to a VAT, in part because of the added paperwork burdens involved in administering such a tax. However, he said he believed it would be one of the options the commission would seriously consider because of the strong backing it has among lobbyists for big corporations who believe such a tax would ease the pressure on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to boost corporate taxes. But <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> said <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> has not expressed any preferences for a VAT or any other type of tax.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> drew inspiration from `` that feisty little guy'' <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> on Thursday and charged <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with trying to masquerade a tax break for the rich as a jobs program. The Democratic presidential nominee invoked <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>'s battling underdog memory across the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> as he pressed his argument that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is an elitist whose proposal to reduce the federal tax on capital gains would benefit primarily the wealthy. `` He said it was a jobs program,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Who's he kidding? `` What are they going to do with the extra money? Hire a second butler? A lifeguard for the pool?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spoke to supporters in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Evergreen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Machesney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, before flying to <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, for a live interview on the CBS Evening News. The interview was part of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' effort to revive his struggling campaign by taking advantage of opportunities to speak directly to the voters through television. He was also taping an interview with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> to appear later. He had a question-and-answer session with citizens in Independence, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, hometown of the late former president whose victory in the 1948 election over Republican <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> confounded the pollsters. `` We're going to <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and then to Independence to draw inspiration from that feisty little guy,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> was a fighter and so am I and so are you,'' he said. `` The Republicans are trying to do in this campaign exactly what they tried to do to <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> _ distort the record, try to put labels on people. But we're not going to let them do it.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, after several days of discouraging polls, appeared energized by large, enthusiastic crowds and by a reunion with his wife <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>, who had been campaigning separately for several days. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s tax proposal has become an object of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' scorn at every campaign stop, as he depicts it as providing a $ 30,000 tax break for someone making more than $ 200,000 a year _ although the benefit would depend on an individual's capital gains, such as profits from the sale of stock or property. He focused on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s assertion a day earlier that a reduction in the maximum rate on capital gains to 15 percent would encourage the investment of capital and thus create jobs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the proposal was `` Halloween come early _ a treat for the wealthiest 1 percent and a trick for the rest of us.'' `` That's not the way we're going to create good quality jobs in this country,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` This is classic Republican trickle-down economics,'' he said. `` Give the people at the top the money and hope a few crumbs fall off the table for the rest of us.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides distributed a statement saying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s claims for the tax cut `` grow more fantastic'' and calling his assertion `` a lie.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign spokesman <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> later said the campaign based its statement on an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> report Wednesday. That report erroneously quoted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as saying `` most capital gains are realized by people who earn less than $ 50,000 a year,'' a statement about the value of gains realized rather than the number of people claiming such gains. In fact, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` the majority of capital gains recipients earn less than $ 50,000 a year, and the cut will create jobs.'' In <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leveled new criticism at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for a regulatory relief task force that the vice president headed and which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said sought to roll back worker safety regulations. He cited the death of a chemical worker after the task force `` told <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> to ease up on the kind of inspections being made in plants like his.'' `` And they talk about ` a kinder, gentler nation,''' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, using a favorite <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> line. `` In a Dukakis-Bentsen admininstration, we're going to put safety first and people first.''

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to rebuild its embassy in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is based on unsubstantiated charges that the facility is riddled with listening devices, the official Soviet news agency said Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said in a dispatch from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that both countries will suffer because opening new embassies in both capitals will be delayed. Earlier Thursday, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he recommended that the new <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> be razed and rebuilt `` because there's no way to rid it of the many listening devices that were built into it.'' `` We're going to start and have an American-built one,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said of the embassy. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, in the first Soviet reaction to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision, said the spying allegations were unproven. `` The Soviet side was again presented with groundless, obviously far-fetched charges of ... <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> state sovereignty having been outraged,'' the news agency said. `` Just as in previous cases, however, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration did not provide any material proof to back up those claims this time as well.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> repeatedly declined to tell reporters what devices the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> discovered in the new structure or how they were installed because `` it's never in anyone's interest to let the other guy know what you know.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> taxpayer will suffer because of the extra cost of rebuilding the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> diplomatic outpost. Without giving figures, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said tearing down the existing structure and building a new one under high security conditions will involve `` a very elaborate and costly process.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspectors first discovered eavesdropping bugs, in structural elements built by Soviet workers and transported to the site, in the spring of 1987.

 Leftist guerrillas exploded bombs and attacked a naval base and a police station during a general strike Thursday, but millions of workers went to their jobs. One man was killed when a bomb exploded in the office of a leftist party that supported the one-day strike, said the minister of defense, Gen. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Samudio </PERSON>. Workers clung to the outside of the few packed buses that continued to operate and clambered into government trucks and army vehicles to get to work. Labor Minister <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Caicedo </PERSON> said an estimated 97 percent of workers showed up for their jobs despite the strike, called by the three largest labor unions. He said he was surprised by the display of `` democracy and sensibility.'' Guerrillas attacked the police station and naval base in the northern town of Turbo at 2 a.m., but the assault was repulsed and no one was injured, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. It did not say how many guerrillas attacked. Rebels elsewhere blew up electric lines, railway tracks and a bridge, <PERSON> Gen </PERSON> <PERSON> Samudio </PERSON> said. All of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s 300,000 policemen and soldiers were ordered to duty during the strike. Armored cars and jeeps mounted with machine guns patrolled streets. <PERSON> Samudio </PERSON> said the fatal bomb exploded in the offices of the <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> party at <LOCATION> Apartado </LOCATION> in the banana-growing north. The area has been plagued with violence. Guerrillas attacked four towns this week and ordered townspeople to support the strike. Right-wing death squads have killed more than 100 peasants in the six months in the area, where labor unions are active among plantation workers. It appeared only about 10 percent of the businesses in downtown <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, a city of 6 million people, were closed for the strike. The <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> resort city of <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION> was without electricity Thursday because guerrillas blew up an electricity tower, the national police said. Guerrillas also blew up a power pylon in the northwest city of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> and rail lines in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, but no one was hurt, police said. The unions called the strike to demand higher wages, lower inflation, a price freeze on basic foods and government action against right-wing death squads. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s minimum wage is about $ 90 a month and inflation has been running at an annual rate of 22 percent this year. Rightist death squads have killed 800 people in last two years, including about 180 union members. The three unions, whose 800,000 members are only about 10 percent of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s workers, are the Workers' Unitary Central, General Confederation of Labor and the Colombian Confederation of Workers.

<HEAD>Agency Approves 20 Percent Pay Bonus at Hard-to-Staff Airports</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> received permission Thursday to offer pay bonuses next year to air traffic controllers and other personnel at hard-to-staff facilities in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The Office of Personnel Management has approved what the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> described as a `` demonstration project'' testing whether incentives will attract qualified employees to unattractive assignments. About 2,000 <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> employees in the three metropolitan areas will be eligible to receive an additional allowance of up to 20 percent of their basic pay under the five-year test program, <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> cited bonuses as part of its plans to ease pressure on overworked controllers at the nation's busiest airport, <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. O'Hare controllers have had 30 flight-handling errors this year compared with 12 mistakes in all of 1987 and their previous record of 22 in 1986. `` This project should make it possible for the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> to achieve full staffing at facilities where living costs, highly complex operations or other factors have made them less attractive locations for employees to move to,'' <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said. The law under which <ORGANIZATION> OPM </ORGANIZATION> approved the bonuses requires a 180-day waiting period to give <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> time to review its decision, so the incentives can not begin until May, said the agency's director, <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Horner </PERSON>. However, Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., said he would introduce legislation in January to waive the waiting period because more experienced controllers are needed at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> More than 60 percent of the employees eligible for the bonus pay will be controllers, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. The rest are safety inspectors and the technicians who service and maintain air-traffic control computers and other equipment. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said facilities chosen for incentives include air route traffic control centers at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, control towers and terminal radar approach control centers at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, terminal radar approach centers at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Anna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and flight standards district offices at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Farmingdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stream </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Teterboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>With AM-Trapped Whales</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The American-Soviet rescue of two whales off <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> was an example of superpower cooperation that should include helping people, government spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said Thursday. Two Soviet icebreakers cut a channel in thick ice off northern <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> on Wednesday, allowing the whales to start their long journey to their winter home off <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Millions of Soviets learned of the success on the evening television news program Vremya, which has covered the story for at least a week. In a report sandwiched between news of sports and the weather, an announcer said: `` And one more piece of news: Soviet ships, with the assistance of American specialists and numerous volunteers, freed two gray <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> whales who had been taken prisoners of ice off the shores of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>.'' Television showed the whales swimming freely, the Soviet icebreakers and helicopters overhead. The announcer then said the whales had stopped moving, apparently because slivers of ice blocked their way, and the Soviet ships would try to clear the channel Friday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the whales still were some distance from open sea, in the path cleared by the icebreakers Admiral <PERSON> Makarov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Arseniev </PERSON>. At an earlier news briefing that focused on the weightier matters of arms control and civil war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> turned attention to the whales. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and us, we've saved those unfortunate whales,'' he said. `` There's now a path broken down in the ice and we hope that the whales will go the way they're supposed to, that is towards the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the coast of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, although the reports show that they now seem to be very dependent on the foodstuffs they get there.'' While reporters chuckled, he praised the international rescue as an example of superpower cooperation. `` We've done all we could to save them, and it would be good if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> acted in such a concerted way when what's involved is the saving of human life,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. The concern for the whales is a change of position for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which killed hundreds of the mammals in violation of international agreements. In April, the Soviets followed up on informal pledges and officially notified the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> it had stopped commerical whaling. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whaling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, to which the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> belongs, ordered commercial killing of whales to stop in 1986.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s defense ministers tried to unravel a snag in talks Thursday after <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> balked at joining a call for modernizing short-range nuclear weapons. The recommendation is contained in a report prepared by high-level defense officials from <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations. The study details a continuing need for short-range nuclear arms now that the superpowers have agreed to scrap medium-range nuclear weapons. In December, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> signed the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty. That pact will eliminate in three years all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet land-based missiles with ranges from about 300 miles to 3,400 miles. Officials said participants at this week's talks were trying to gain Belgian endorsement of the classified report presented to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and defense chiefs from 14 other nations in the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. They were meeting at a resort outside The Hague, <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. Belgian Defense Minister <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Coeme </PERSON> told a Belgian radio station Wednesday night he intended `` to ring the alarm bell'' about the report. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tindemans </PERSON> said in an interview with a <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> daily the report might set the stage for a final decision to moderize short-range nuclear arms. `` I think we can wait with that,'' he said. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Plesch </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said the report by high-level defense officials was worrisome. `` Just when you thought you were safe -LRB- with the intermediate-range treaty -RRB-, along comes a lot more missiles and the idea that you can have limited nuclear war,'' he said. The issue of modernizing short-range weapons is controversial in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where critics argue the weapons would likely be used on their soil because of their range under 300 miles. However, several ministers at the talks said Thursday that <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s objections were minor and that it would eventually approve the report. British Defense Minister <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Younger </PERSON> said the Belgian position was `` extraordinarily close to the other positions.'' A summary of the report, made available by the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said it outlined several options for restructuring <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear forces. Copies of the summary also were released by the <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> fpr </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, which opposes nuclear weapons and led the fight against deploying medium-range missiles in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Efforts to reach Belgian officials for comment were not successful. The report generally recommends a continued role in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> strategy of short-range nuclear forces. It calls for continuing support for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British efforts to develop a new, longer range tactical air-to-surface missile that could be fired at Soviet air defenses from fighter planes. The report also backs <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to develop a replacement for the Lance surface-to-surface nuclear missile, which military analysts say will be obsolete by 1995. The defense ministers gather twice a year to discuss nuclear strategy. Fourteen of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s 16 members take part, with <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> attending as an observer. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> operates outside <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s military structure. No final decision on modernization of the weapons was expected until next year at the earliest, officials said.

<HEAD>Child Injured by Lawn Dart Kept in Coma; Congress Voted to Ban Game
Last Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An 11-year-old girl accidentally stabbed in the forehead by a lawn dart was kept comatose Thursday as her doctors waited for swelling in her brain to subside. <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrin </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> McMinnville </ORGANIZATION> was in critical condition in the pediatric intensive care unit of <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> after eight hours of surgery to remove and repair damage caused by the 1-pound steel and plastic dart. `` They've been keeping her asleep,'' <PERSON> Amy </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, said Thursday. `` They did n't want the brain to do any functioning on its own till they found out whether or not the brain was going to swell. It's just wait and see how things are and do a lot of praying.'' The girl was injured Tuesday evening as she played the horseshoe-like game with a cousin outside a neighbor's house. The object of the game is to toss the darts, which have 4-inch-long metal points, into a ring placed on the ground. The accident came after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed legislation last week ordering the government to ban the sale of lawn darts, a game that is blamed for the deaths of three children and injuries to thousands of others. The Consumer Product <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> was ordered to prohibit sale of the darts within 60 days unless it determines that the game can not cause puncture wounds. It was to consider the matter at a meeting Friday. Mrs. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said the cousin raced into her kitchen at about 5:30 p.m., followed by <PERSON> Amy </PERSON>, with the dart still protruding from her head. `` She just said, ` Momma, it's in my head.' All else I remember is me screaming,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said. The girl has suffered some brain damage but doctors do n't know how much, said <PERSON> Amy </PERSON>'s stepfather, <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>. He said she faces more surgery. Surgeons had to cut into her skull to get the dart out, <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said, `` and they're going to have to go back in and put in a plate in her forehead.'' The cousin who threw the dart `` was real tore up,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said. `` He came down -LRB- to the hospital -RRB- with his mother and dad. He's only 11 years old He brought -LRB- Amy -RRB- ... flowers and a big balloon.'' Federal law currently requires that the darts carry warning labels stating the game is not for children and can cause serious injury or death. They are not to be sold in toy stores or in toy departments. `` No toy could do the damage that's been done to my baby,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>U.S. Citizens Group Says U.S.-U.N. Relations in Disarray</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The leading <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens group on the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that the world body is in need of major changes and that the next administration in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> should make <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> reform a top priority. The report released by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its chairman, <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, lamented that U.S.-U.N. relations are in disarray and urged the next administration to pay <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arrears of more than $ 400 million. `` With the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> enjoying renewed credibility as it brings some of the world's most bitter conflicts to an end ... the prospects for <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> purposeful global action ... are brighter than at any time in recent history,'' it said. `` A new realism in both the Third World and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has created new opportunities for international cooperation in the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> _ but also <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s own relations with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> are in disarray,'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney general and defense secretary, noted in the report. The disarray results from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nonpayment and withholding of its budget dues, which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is legally obliged to pay. In addition, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has been estranged from the organization for nearly eight years, accusing it of anti-Western bias, a bloated bureaucracy and wasteful spending. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has balked at giving up any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prerogatives to act for itself in favor of multilateral solutions. The administration acknowledged, however, that the 159-member world body has instituted major reforms and made dramatic contributions to conflict resolution, from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to the Iran-Iraq war. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is a nonpartisan, nationwide organization with more than 20,000 members. Its recommendations are based on public meetings in about 100 communities. Its report made about 85 specific recommendations, including changing the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> voting system and enlarging <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> membership. It said the next <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration should increase <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> participation in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and should not try to reduce its 25 percent share of the budget. It should instead use its financial leverage to make the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> more effective in promoting both <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests and world peace. The report found many <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> decision-making bodies too unwieldy to be effective forums for negotiations. It said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> should insist on reforms that would enhance the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> system as the center for resolving global problems. The study said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should make sure that <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> budgetary reforms adopted in 1986 are implemented and result in greater efficiency in use of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resources. It said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should renew its campaign for `` weighted'' voting on budgetary issues in the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, effectively giving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and major donors a greater say in how their funds are spent. But it said `` weight'' also should consider a nation's population. The report said the 15-member <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> should be restructured to include a category of semi-permanent members, representing major powers in each region. This might warrant an increase of up to four members in council size. The council also should meet at least once a year at foreign minister level and defense ministers also should meet periodically, it said. The council's Military Staff Committee should be revitalized and oversee limited joint military exercises among the five permament members _ a sign of their willingness to collaborate in guaranteeing international peace and security. The five are the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. They traditionally play no part in peacekeeping operations. The study proposed that the council look into establishment of a training program for countries that contribute troops to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping forces. It said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> members should establish a reserve fund under the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to cover initial outlays of new peacekeeping missions. Among other recommendations: _ Creation of a multilateral drug enforcement assistance unit within the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> _ Establishment of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> elections commission to monitor and conduct free elections at the request of individual nations _ An international ban on chemical weapons, with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> assuming the bulk of verification _ An international convention on environment and development _ An international tribunal to rule on disputed drug trafficking cases _ A ministerial board at the helm of the Economic and <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to oversee <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> responses to emerging economic, environmental and social problems And it said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general should guard against demands by member states for political appointments. The report is entitled `` Pulling Together: A Program for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> founded the New York-based association 24 years ago to foster better understanding of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> role in it.

 When colonial patriots tossed 342 chests of tea into <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, they thought they had rid the city of the symbols of tyranny. But now, an explorer says he has located the dump site and wants to salvage the chests. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>, who located the first pirate ship found in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> World </LOCATION> four years ago, appeared Thursday before the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Underwater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archaeological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> for permission to survey the Tea Party site. `` <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> is an archaeological site,'' <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> said in his presentation to the board. `` In this day and age, when we have knowledge of what's at the bottom of the harbor, it's too bad not to plan so we do n't put a tunnel through a 17th century shipwreck.'' The board, however, tabled his bid for a reconnaissance permit, which would have awarded <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> and his team exclusive rights to survey a nautical square mile in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. Officials asked <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> to return for the board's next session Dec. 1 with more details about the site. Acting board director <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said the explorer must provide more specific proof that he has found the location of the <ORGANIZATION> Tea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chests before the board awards him exclusive rights. Until then, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> and his team are free to electronically scan the harbor but will not be given an exclusive right to the area. <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> said at the meeting that he did not include specific data about the site in his permit application because of a security risk in publicizing the area. <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Explorations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chatham </LOCATION>, surprised skeptics when he found the treasure-laden Whydah off the coast of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION> in 1984 and brought up the ship's bell. Still, experts have doubts about <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>'s latest venture. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, curator of marine history at the <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> and a maritime archaeologist, is dubious about <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>'s claim that the tea crates were elaborate Chinese chests <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said the museum has similar ornate Chinese boxes but said that they were gift boxes. He said he doubts that the British would have exported tea in fancy containers. `` They were probably standard wooden crates,'' said <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> also said that he recently learned the site of the tea dumping was at <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Wharf </ORGANIZATION>, which lies considerably inland from today's <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. The wharf is now located beneath a concrete pad under a <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> substation, he said. `` It seems unrealistic to think he could find the tea chests now,'' said <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>. `` The whole landscape of the harbor has changed since then.'' <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> and his team have been researching the harbor for 18 months and hope to look for shipwrecks as well as the Tea Party chests. He wants to examine what he believes is the Tea Party site with the Maritime Explorer, his 166-foot excavation ship. The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> commenced just after dusk on Dec. 16, 1773, when 30 patriots, angered over King <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'s three-penny tax on a pound of tea, raided three ships, the <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> and the Beaver. Disguised as Indians, the patriots located the crates in the ship's hold, brought them on deck, opened them and pitched them overboard.

 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, son of the famed arctic explorer, died of malnutrition and dehydration contributed to by <PERSON> Alzheimer </PERSON>'s disease, the state medical examiner said Thursday. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, 68, was found Oct. 3 in a <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> warehouse. He had taken a train from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Sept. 13 for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to attend ceremonies honoring his father, Adm. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, who flew over the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pole </LOCATION> in 1926 and later led a series of expeditions to <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>. Chief Medical Examiner <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smialek </PERSON> said an autopsy revealed that <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> died of `` malnutrition and dehydration, contributed to by an underlying degenerative brain disease ... Alzheimer's.'' Alzheimer's is an organic brain disease that gradually robs its victims of memory and other intellectual powers. Its cause is unknown and there is no cure. <PERSON> Smialek </PERSON> said he had spoken with <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>'s family, who had not suspected that he suffered from Alzheimer's. `` They were at a loss to explain what happened to him,'' he said. `` When I spoke to them they were considerably relieved to have that understanding of what had happened.'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> apparently got off the train in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and began wandering, <PERSON> Smialek </PERSON> said. `` In his confused state, he could have appeared to be intoxicated. ... He was n't able to seek help.'' Instead, he gradually became weak from not eating or drinking, <PERSON> Smialek </PERSON> said. When <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>'s family learned that he did not arrive at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> ceremony, they filed a missing-person report with <LOCATION> Needham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, police Sept. 15. A custodian at the warehouse where <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>'s body was found told police he had ordered <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> and another man out of the building Sept. 27. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> had been dead for several days when his body was found Oct. 3. He wore a green workman's uniform and one shoe. His wallet, luggage and other personal property were missing. He was identified through a <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> card that was pinned to his undershorts.

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The death toll from leftist guerrillas this week rose to 64 and Colombians prepared on Wednesday for more violence during an impending general strike supported by the rebels. Many drivers in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> tied small tree branches to their front bumpers, hoping they would sweep away nails and tacks being spread in the streets by strike sympathizers. Most businesses and all schools routinely close during general strikes. The three largest labor unions called the one-day strike for Thursday, demanding an increased minimum wage, lower inflation, a price freeze on basic foods and action against right-wing death squads. President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> ordered <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s 300,000 police officers and soldiers to be on duty Thursday. A guerrilla ambush of a civilian bus carrying policemen killed 20 people, Gov. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Roldan </PERSON> <PERSON> Betancur </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Antioquia </LOCATION> state told a news conference Wednesday in the state capital <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. He said rebels knocked the bus off the road with a dynamite charge Tuesday morning in a remote part of the Andes in northern <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, then it with automatic weapons fire. Ten policemen and 10 civilians, including a pregnant woman and a 1-year-old boy, were killed in the ambush and 12 people were wounded, the governor said. the ambush occurred near <LOCATION> Peque </LOCATION> village, 200 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. On Tuesday and Wednesday, 10 buses were set afire in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunja </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bucaramanga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Valledupar </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Popayan </LOCATION>, national police said in a statement. A bomb exploded Wednesday in a <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, shopping center but no one was hurt, police reported. Soldiers and police set up checkpoints in major cities, searching cars for guns and explosives. Army squads with assault rifles and jeeps mounted with .30 caliber machine guns patrolled streets Wednesday. Two people were found trying to plant a bomb Tuesday in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>'s convention center where the minister of mines and energy, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON> <PERSON> Vallejo </PERSON>, was speaking to an oil industry convention, police said In the northern, banana-growing region of <LOCATION> Uraba </LOCATION>, guerrillas raided three plantations, burned eight vehicles and destroyed an airport and banana processing equipment, national police said in <LOCATION> Antioquia </LOCATION> state. Guerrillas raided two villages in eastern <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> on Tuesday and harangued residents to back the strike, said the army's 5th Brigade in <LOCATION> Bucaramanga </LOCATION>. Unions organizing the strike want the minimum wage raised from the current equivalent of about $ 90 a month for a six-day work week and the inflation ratelowered from 22 percent. Death squads are accused of killing about 800 people in the past two years, including 180 union members.

 Two men and a woman, all from the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, were convicted Thursday of conspiring to kill <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s top official for <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, police said a Soviet-made flamethrower capable of sending a jet of fire 80 yards was discovered in an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> arms cache and could have come from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. After 15 hours of deliberation, a jury at <ORGANIZATION> Winchester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> determined by a 10-2 vote that <PERSON> Martina </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanahan </PERSON>, 22, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Finbarr </PERSON> <PERSON> Cullen </PERSON>, 27, of <PERSON> Maynooth </PERSON> conspired to murder <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> Secretary <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> and other persons unknown. They were to be sentenced Friday by Judge <PERSON> Swinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. Police arrested the defendants Aug. 30, 1987, near King's home in <LOCATION> Wiltshire </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, southern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> _ Ms. <PERSON> Shanahan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cullen </PERSON> on adjoining land and <PERSON> McCann </PERSON> at a campsite 30 miles away. <PERSON> Elisa </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, the Cabinet member's daughter, had noticed <PERSON> Cullen </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Shanahan </PERSON>. Prosecutor <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rawley </PERSON> said the tent at the trio's campsite contained a list written on cigarette papers of politicians, soldiers and judges in mainland <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. They also had 4,500 pounds -LRB- nearly $ 8,000 -RRB-, binoculars, a radio that could pick up police frequencies and a woollen hat with eyeholes, he said. `` The whole thing stinks to high heaven of a murderous plot to kill Mr. <PERSON> King </PERSON> if they could, or anybody else on that list if they could,'' <PERSON> Rawley </PERSON> declared. He said they had the addresses and auto license numbers of people on the list, the names of military establishments and locations of offices of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. No evidence was produced in the 14-day trial that the defendants belonged to the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which is fighting to drive the British from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, and no weapons or explosives were found. A report by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> domestic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> news </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said the three had a history of support for <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s legal political arm <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> police said the flamethrower, the first weapon of its kind found in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, was under the stairs of an outbuilding on the grounds of a hospice for elderly women in <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>, a Roman Catholic area. They said bomb-timers, ammunition and a cement-mixer, which can be used for mixing explosives, were found with it. Staff members at the hospice refused comment on the police search. Police spokesmen said they believed the weapon was part of the huge consignment of Libyan-supplied arms smuggled into <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. In March, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> officials said the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> had received 150 tons of weapons from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> in four shiploads in 1985 and 1986, including SAM-7 surface-to-air missiles that could be used to shoot down British army helicopters.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pocketed a labor endorsement Thursday and said his drive for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> was `` all about creating jobs and opportunity.'' Underdog <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> accused his <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> rival of airing negative campaign commercials to `` divert attention'' from Reagan-Bush administration failures. The pollsters' daily tidings were good once again for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was reported leading 51 percent to 42 percent in a nationwide survey taken for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and the Wall Street Journal. New polls also showed a tight race in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, one of the country's most Democratic bastions. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made his way toward <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>'s home town of Independence, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, likening himself to the `` feisty little guy'' who won the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> four decades ago in a storied upset. `` <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> was a fighter and so am I,'' he said. In a 14-minute live interview on the CBS `` Evening News,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said again and again he wants to put the government on the `` side of average Americans.'' The Democrat also conceded that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> commercials depicting him as weak on crime, defense and the environment had done him political harm. But he said they were also intended to `` to divert public attention from the fact that this administration has probably had more corruption and malfeasance than any in recent memory if not in history.'' `` This is not about who puts together the best commercials or best advertising,'' he said. `` It's about which one of us, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> or <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, has the strength and the values to run this country.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> continued his week-long emphasis on economic issues as he made his way down the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Along the way he accused <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of trying to `` fan the flames of protectionism'' in comments on trade and of `` trying to scare the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people by putting Japanese flags on these American commercials of his.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won the endorsement of the 50,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beneficial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> at a rally interrupted by protesters. Four were hustled away, including one whose nose was bloodied, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> paused in his speech long enough to remind them of the high interest rates that prevailed at the end of the Carter administration. `` This election is all about creating jobs and opportunity,'' he said, promising to keep the economic expansion alive. He briefly added an endorsement from the <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> to his union support, but that was before the group's president reluctantly reversed course under pressure from national headquarters. <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said she was acting to avoid jeopardizing the chapter's tax-exempt status as a non-profit organization. The nine-point lead found for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the NBC-Wall Street Journal poll was in keeping with what sources said were private soundings taken for the two candidates. Only 35 percent of those reponding to the public survey said they were pleased with their choices, and 61 percent said they wished other candidates were running. The survey, taken from 1,285 likely voters, had a margin of error of three percentage points. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign announced it would double its budget for advertisements targeted at Hispanic voters to $ 1 million, with most of the money earmarked for seven key states _ <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. The announcement came the same day that radio stations began carrying paid Democratic commercials in which <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> urged a vote for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Both candidates filed reports with the federal government showing huge warchests going into the final few days of the election. Each candidate received $ 46.1 million in federal subsidies for the fall campaign, and as of last week, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had $ 14.3 remaining while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had a balance of nearly $ 19.9 million. The campaign surrogates and understudies joined the chorus 12 days before the election. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> hailed `` the true grit of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'' as he embarked on a week-long campaign swing aiming to help make sure the White House stays in Republican hands. `` You and I and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> worked much too hard to cut your taxes to let our opponents come into office and raise them all over again,'' he said in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, where he renewed his pledge to assure college opportunity for all who want it. But he offered no specifics, saying he had spoken with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` about education issues in general'' but they `` have n't sat down and discussed detailed proposals.'' Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told an audience in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> should pay a greater share of defending their own borders. He also said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was firmly committed to maintaining <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s defense, and said <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> had `` twisted the truth'' to suggest otherwise. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaigned in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, and he ridiculed the idea thatBush's proposed capital gains tax cut was a jobs program. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wanted to `` give the people at the top the money and hope the crumbs fall off the table for the rest of us ... `` Who's he kidding?'' the Democrat said. `` What are they going to do with the extra money? Hire a second butler? A lifeguard for the pool?'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> repeatedly emphasized his opposition to federal gun controls as he campaigned in the West. His aides distributed copies of a 1976 statement in which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> called for tight handgun restrictions. The vice president's morning appearance in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state was interrupted by shouts of `` homes for the homeless'' and `` No more lies.'' The vice president shrugged off the disruptions, telling his cheering supporters that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> needs a strong defense and a vibrant economy, not the policies of the `` governor of Taxachusetts.''

 <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said Thursday he wanted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to pick up a bigger share of the free world's defense costs within the next four years. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, speaking before the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> spends 6.5 percent of its output on the military, that it can no longer afford to carry the burden for other nations and that allies strapped after World War II can now afford to do more. Afterward, at a news conference, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said it cost $ 3.5 billion to protect <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` They could pick up that tab,'' he said, though he does not support re-arming <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. European allies should also spend more to equalize the burden, he said, although he added that they were now doing more with their own troops. In his speech, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said he and Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> were firmly committed to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense strength but the Republicans had `` twisted the truth to imply that Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is an apostle of military weakness.'' `` That's just not so,'' he said. Both parties plan to spend the same amount of money on defense, but the Democrats recognize that there are other threats to national security, he said. `` I would suggest that it will profit <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> little to gain the whole world of military superiority if we lose the soul of our economic capacity,'' he said. `` It will profit us little to be military hawks if the competition is between economic eagles and we are sitting ducks.'' Republican policies have turned the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> into an international debtor, dependent on foreign investors to sustain an economy saddled with huge trade and budget deficits, he said. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must be able to compete not only militarily but economically'' if it intends to maintain leadership in the free world and set an example for developing nations, he told the council, a private group of business and academic people. Taking questions from the group afterward, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said he supported some forgiveness of the international debt owed to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks by <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> on a `` case by case basis'' but not as a nation as a whole. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> needs to be treated `` like a company that went bankrupt'' that pays part but not all on its obligations, he said. The council, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> based group is scheduled to hear President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Friday. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> joked that he was warming them up for the president. But he complained the Republicans `` have found it useful to shape the discussion as if military strength were the sole touchstone of national strength. They have twisted the truth to imply that Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is an apostle of military weakness.'' `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people need to understand that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> are firmly committed to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military strength,'' he said. `` Any implication to the contrary is not just negative campaigning, it is a misrepresentation of fact.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> called for tough enforcement of the new trade bill which he helped push through the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, to open up new markets for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods. In addition, he said investment in non-military research and development needed to increase, after being cut 23 percent during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years. `` While following a passive policy on trade, our government unfortunately has countenanced retreats on other fronts as well,'' he said. `` Our industrial and academic research base, once the world's foremost, is losing ground,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Chico </LOCATION>, with a little help from actor <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> drew the biggest crowd of his campaign so far at a rally at <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. A crowd police estimated at 7,000 students and local citizens heard <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> continue his attacks against <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> `` negative campaigning'' and call for the election to be a `` national referendm against mudslinging.'' `` We're going to turn this election around,'' he said, saying the Democrats were coming back in the polls. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> told the crowd, including young women who were enthusiastically screaming at the sight of the celebrity, that the 67-year-old <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was `` a man for the young people.'' The two were mobbed as they left the outdoor stage, and the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator shook hands, gave `` high-fives'' and even kissed one woman student as he worked his way through the crowd. Local people said it was the first appearance there by a national candidate since <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> in 1960.

<HEAD>Anti-Defamation League Says Neo-Nazi Skinhead Groups On Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An organization that monitors hate groups says neo-Nazi `` skinhead'' gangs are a growing threat to minorities and homosexuals, with the number of such gang members nearly doubling in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year. Skinhead gangs, found in 21 states, also are increasingly establishing ties with such groups as the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> and the White Aryan Resistance, the Anti-Defamation League of the B'nai B'rith said Wednesday in a national report. Skinheads _ youths who shave their heads and preach hatred of minorities _ have taken part `` in virtually every recent important hate movement rally, march and conference,'' the report said. Skinhead membership nationally has swelled to 2,000, according to the report, with the majority of members _ as well as the most violent _ found in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Skinheads have been blamed for the racially motivated killing of a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> man and attacks on homosexuals in <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. The report, `` Hate Crimes: Policies and Procedures for Law Enforcement Agencies,'' was released in conjunction with a conference in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> sponsored by the league. The organization, an outgrowth of the Jewish fraternal group B'nai B'rith, has surveyed anti-Semitic vandalism since 1960 and broadened its approach in 1979 with publication of an annual audit of anti-Semitic incidents based on information reported to league regional offices. The report said all kinds of hate crimes should be identified and tallied nationwide so law enforcement agencies can determine whether special units and procedures are needed. Crimes motivated by hatred or bias because of the victim's race, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity or national origin can have a more devastating effect than other crimes, the report said. `` Hate crimes can have a special emotional and psychological impact ... thereby creating the potential for escalating violence and turmoil,'' it said. The report was written by <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>; <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> ADL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, and Associate Director <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> said in an interview that the most important question about hate crimes is whether the number is increasing, stable or decreasing. `` We believe that one of the real problems in addressing that is the lack of hard, comparable and comprehensive data on the issue,'' he said. There are only a handful of law enforcement agencies in eight states that are required to keep statistics on hate crimes, he said, adding, `` It's anyone's guess as to whether the numbers are going up or down.''

 Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is promising the chance for a college education to anyone who wants it under a <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, but admitted Thursday he did not know how the Republican presidential contender plans to make it happen. `` I have n't sat down and talked with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on this,'' he told local reporters in <LOCATION> Asheville </LOCATION>. `` So I ca n't go in and tell you anything.'' Later Thursday, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> campaigned in a high-technology part of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, visiting an <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T long distance headquarters in <LOCATION> Bedminster </LOCATION>. There he spoke by satellite hookup to employees at 29 <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T facilities in the state. On the way to the appearance, a campaign staff bus collided with a school van, and a number of children were taken to a local hospital for observation. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> arranged to visit the children. He said the company represents the technological changes of the future, adding, `` Anyone prepared to lead us into the 1990s and then into the 21st century must be prepared to harness this change _ to capture its spirit, its momentum and its excitement so that we turn challenge into achievement. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also told reporters asking him about homelessness he thinks there is enough low-income housing in the country and the number of low-income housing units has increased under <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` But that does n't mean that is the only answer or solution,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. He said he government should identify other factors contributing to homelessness, and then work with state and local governments and the private sector on solutions. On the question of higher education, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> repeated a comment that he made a day earlier in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>: `` We're going to make sure that a student that wants to go on to higher education will have that opportunity.'' But he could give no specifics when reporters asked him what he dould do toward that goal. He said he has spoken to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` about education issues in general'' but they `` have n't sat down and discussed detailed proposals.'' The remarks came on a campaign day in which he kept the rhetorical heat on Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, joked to a <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, audience that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was like the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> whales that got trapped beneath an Alaskan ice floe. He said one eskimo told another the whales were named <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` ` Know what <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> means?' the eskimo said. ` Hopelessly stuck in the ice.''' Although <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> generally dealt skillfully with hecklers throughout the day, some supporters seemed to think he was going a bit too far in putting down a group of them by referring to the severely polluted <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> harbor in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' home state of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. The harbor is a centerpiece of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attack campaign against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` Ever hear of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> asked the campus rally. `` Matter of fact, I think <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> is right over here,'' he said pointing to the pro-Dukakis signs. `` Ouch,'' said one <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> supporter, as a couple nearby groaned. He dealt with a more boisterous crowd in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, where hecklers forced him to interrupt his speech. The noise level rose when <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> supporters in the <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> tried to shout down the pro-Dukakis hecklers.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> returned to his home state on Thursday and predicted that Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will `` win fair and square'' in the Nov. 8 election. `` Now that the game seems to have turned against them, the liberals have started squealing that he's running a negative campaign,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> rally at the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arena </ORGANIZATION>. `` Well, I hope the people of <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> will forgive me, but that would be a little like the A's complaining that the <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> ran a negative World Series,'' the president said. `` They did n't,'' he told his <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> audience. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> won fair and square, and come Nov. 8, the Republicans are going to win fair and square too because they know we stand for the future and they know the opposition is liberal, liberal, liberal.'' The crowd, which assistant White House press secretary <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarratt </PERSON> said was estimated at 11,000, interrupted with frequent cheers and applause and waved small <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags as the president spoke. A large banner reading `` We love Nancy'' hung prominently in the center of the arena although Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> traveled separately to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and missed the rally. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> stop was the president's first in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> during a week-long campaign swing. He and First Lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> reagan </PERSON> will take a weekend break at their ranch near <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> before he resumes campaigning. The White House said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would vote by absentee ballot during the trip. Republicans count on the Californian in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as a major factor in their hopes of garnering the state's 47 electoral votes. Earlier, at <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Americans should vote for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket `` as an act of self-defense'' because Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> favors gun controls. At <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, the president who once was a Democrat courted votes for Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates in President <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>'s home state. `` Today, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>'s party is the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and it's time to give that party a bigger stick in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and cut the liberals down to size,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said `` We do n't want a president who would raise taxes; why elect a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that would?'' he asked. `` We do n't want a big-spending president, why should we want a big-spending <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>? We do n't want a president who would cut our defenses; why vote for a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that wants to do that?'' The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> speech marked the president's second visit to his home state since the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> in mid-August. During his previous visit in August, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> campaigned in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, a center of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> conservatism south of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` Nothing is more important in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> race than the turnout in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and the Inland Empire,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heslop </PERSON>, a specialist in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> voting patterns. `` Those are the great vote-rich areas for Republican candidates in this state and to wheel <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> through the <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION> is to give encouragement to the party workers. It is to gear up the turnout and the get-out-the vote drive,'' he said. It is also to raise money. Before his current swing, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 21 political appearances in 13 states since Labor Day had raised an estimated $ 8.8 million for national and state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> campaign treasuries. Before he returns to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> next Wednesday, he will rest at his <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> area ranch over the weekend and then speak in <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> and in another state the White House has not identified. In <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, with its six electoral votes, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told his airport audience that `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> needs the strength, the vision, and the true grit of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, a former movie actor, had previously evoked the memory of the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> film classic, `` True Grit,'' in extolling his vice president, but in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> he extended the remark to include the youthful <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator who is <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vice presidential running mate. It was the only reference to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in the speech, which was devoted largely to praising <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s record as vice president. `` I have come to know <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> very well,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` And I also know what is required to be president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>; I know who should be the man at the desk, and ladies and gentlemen, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is the man.'' `` You and I and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> worked much too hard to cut your taxes to let our opponents come into office and raise them all over again,'' he said. `` So on Nov. 8, go into that polling booth and do some negative campaigning of your own, the right kind of negative campaigning: Say ` no' to new taxes and say ` yes' to the Republican ticket.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, has vowed to oppose tax increases. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has not said he will raise taxes, has accused the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign of negative campaigning that distorts his record.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>'s former pastor was indicted Thursday on charges that he skimmed $ 90,000 from his congregation and then tried to persuade Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, the church's secretary, to lie about it to a grand jury. The Rev. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON>, 51, used the money to buy life insurance, buy stocks in his wife's name, pay for family functions and finance gambling junkets to <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in a church-owned plane, according to the charges handed up by an <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury. <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON>, to whom Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said she turned for guidance after her 1980 sexual encounter with <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, was charged with tax evasion, perjury and tampering with a witness. He pleaded innocent and was released on $ 25,000 bail. He was ordered to surrender his passport, pilot's license and gun license and also ordered to stay away from Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> welcomed the court order of protection, but said she was still afraid of <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON>, who she alleged had threatened her in the past. `` He has asked me to lie for him. I did n't lie. There's a lot of reason to believe that he's more than angry,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from the <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> offices in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` He blames me for the entire investigation.'' `` Yeah, I am afraid,'' she said. `` I feel there are too many of his people floating around. I've been threatened in the past.'' Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, who has been living in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> while doing a radio show, declined to say what she had told the grand jury, other than to repeat allegations that <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON> had asked her to help him conceal wrongdoing. Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, in text accompanying a nude pictorial in the September issue of Playboy, said <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON> `` showered her with attention and convinced her that heavy petting with the pastor was part of her role as church secretary, babysitter and consort and would leave her still technically a virgin.'' The text noted that <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON> `` mesmerized young <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> with a combination of fire, brimstone, money and sex.'' In July 1981 <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON> `` persuaded <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> to have sexual intercourse with him for the first time,'' the magazine said. `` He said I'm going to prove to you that I'm not like <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said in the article. `` He was going to show me how women should be treated.'' The magazine said she later began a `` full-fledged romance'' with <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON>. The charges allege that between 1984 and 1986, <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON>, used as their personal funds money taken from the <ORGANIZATION> Full </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gospel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tabernacle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Massapequa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, a non-denominational Christian church where <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON> was the pastor. The indictment also alleged that the Profetas failed to declare the income on their <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state tax returns. The indictment charged that <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON> tried to persuade Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> to lie to the grand jury about gifts she received from him, including fur coats, casino trips, hotel stays, jewelry, apartment rent and automobile payments. The grand jury had been investigating <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON> since the summer of 1987, shortly after the Bakker-Hahn scandal broke. A year ago, Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> appeared before the grand jury and told reporters afterward that <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON>'s church group was `` a world just as disturbed'' as that of <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> television ministry. Since the publicity about her involvement with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> has been featured in <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> interviews and nude pictorials and has stayed at the Playboy mansion in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> issued the protection order for Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> at the request of Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Crusco </PERSON>, despite contentions by <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON>'s lawyer that it would add to a `` media circus'' surrounding the case and deprive <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON> of a fair trial. The attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON>, said the order implied that the tampering allegations against the minister were true. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> responded there was no such implication and <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON> would receive a fair trial. `` These charges represent a scheme to cheat the state and all law-abiding taxpayers,'' said Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>. `` But more importantly, Rev. <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON> allegedly abused the not-for-profit status of a religious organization for his own personal gain.'' Gross refused to discuss the case with reporters. In setting the $ 25,000 bail, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said he wanted assurances from Gross that the money was n't from church funds. <PERSON> Crusco </PERSON> had asked for $ 100,000 bail, while <PERSON> Gross </PERSON> had argued that no bail was needed because of <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON>'s position in the community. `` This man has been a minister for over 30 years,'' <PERSON> Gross </PERSON> said. `` He's got a congregation of over 1,000. There is no proof to these charges.'' <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON> was charged with three counts of offering a false instrument for filing, two counts of tax evasion, six counts of falsifying business records, one count of attempted perjury, three counts of witness tampering and three counts of criminal solicitation. Mrs. <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON>, 44, was indicted on three counts of offering a false instrument for filing and two counts of tax evasion. Her case was postponed until next month because she is recuperating at home from an infection she contracted after surgery, <PERSON> Gross </PERSON> said. The Profetas each face a maximum of four years in prison if convicted of tax evasion and offering a false instrument for filing, the most serious charges.

 A prison supply supervisor who fled war-torn <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> for a new life was bludgeoned to death Thursday at the maximum-security institution. <ORGANIZATION> Stateville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> `` is under lockdown. It will stay on indefinitely ... until we get to the bottom of this,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Nic </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>. He said one prisoner was caught near the scene of the killing, and was being held in separate custody. No charges were filed immediately. The victim, <PERSON> Suon </PERSON> <PERSON> Troeung </PERSON>, 53, of <LOCATION> Romeoville </LOCATION> was struck on the head and was dead on arrival at <ORGANIZATION> Silver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> said, adding he did not know how many times <PERSON> Troeung </PERSON> was struck. Will County State's Attorney <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Masters </PERSON>, whose office will handle the case, said prosecutors were awaiting a report from prison officials before deciding whether to file charges against the suspect. `` We did recover some physical evidence that links the inmate to the attack,'' said <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>. `` We also recovered a piece of pipe we believe may have been used in the attack.'' The suspect was serving a 60-year term for the murder of an off-duty police officer, <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> said. Troeung's body was found early in the day at the prison store he operated where inmates buy cigarettes, shampoo and other items, <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>. Troeung, called `` Sonny'' by co-workers, left <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> in 1975. He had been a captain in the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> army, where he served as a supply officer. Troeung began working at <LOCATION> Stateville </LOCATION> as a correctional officer in 1978 and was promoted to supply supervisor a year later. He was put in charge of the prison commissary in 1985, <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> said.

 The former deacon of a faith-healing sect was convicted Thursday of manslaughter in his son's death from untreated juvenile diabetes. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>, 43, quietly hugged his wife, <PERSON> Judith </PERSON>, following the verdict by a <ORGANIZATION> Spokane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury that deliberated about 10 hours after nearly three weeks of testimony. The Normans were members of a nameless, Christian faith healing sect that eschewed conventional medicine and practiced strict discipline of children and adults. Witnesses testified that the <ORGANIZATION> Normans </ORGANIZATION>' 10-year-old son, <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON>, was spanked and harshly interrogated by his father and sect founder <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleber </PERSON> the day before he died at the family's home near <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> on Dec. 20, 1987. The beatings were an effort to get the boy to confess sins, which the men believed were making him ill, witnesses testified. A doctor testified that the beatings could have worsened the boy's illness. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> admitted under questioning by <PERSON> Colwell </PERSON> that he was responsible for his son's death. Deputy <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Colwell </PERSON> declined to say whether he will ask for a sentence outside the standard 31 - to 41-month range for first-degree manslaughter <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Peven </PERSON>, said it's too early to consider an appeal, noting that the <ORGANIZATION> Normans </ORGANIZATION> originally were both charged with first-degree murder, but only <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> was tried for manslaughter. In closing arguments, <PERSON> Colwell </PERSON> depicted <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> as a `` fanatic'' who recklessly failed to seek medical attention for his son. <PERSON> Peven </PERSON> argued that <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> was a man whose life was controlled by sect leaders and said religious fervor blinded his client to the boy's illness. Sect leaders were seen as prophets, and were consulted on matters ranging from car purchases to sexual relations, testimony indicated. <PERSON> Kleber </PERSON> and former <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> pastor <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, both 34 and from <LOCATION> Champaign-Urbana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, pleaded guilty earlier to second-degree criminal mistreatment. Three former elders face trial on similar charges next year. Before the sect disbanded in February, it claimed about 300 adult members in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>.

 A letter found in a Lebanese woman's luggage and bearing the name of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostage <PERSON> Alann </PERSON> <PERSON> Steen </PERSON> appears to be a fake, police said Thursday. The letter and photographs of two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages _ <PERSON> Steen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> _ were found Oct. 20 in a false bottom of luggage belonging to the woman after she arrived at <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Linate </LOCATION> airport from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> She was identified as <PERSON> Aline </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizkallah </PERSON>, 36. `` We have examined the document -LRB- <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>'s letter -RRB-, and for the moment we can only say that it appears evidently false,'' said <PERSON> Achille </PERSON> <PERSON> Serra </PERSON>, head of the police anti-terrorism unit in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Italian experts compared the signature to samples of <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>'s handwriting. `` If you just take a look, you see that this one is fake,'' he said. Police said earlier the photographs were reproductions of ones issued by kidnapers months ago. A third photograph has not yet been identified. Police said the woman was to deliver the letter, photographs and other documents to <PERSON> Aldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Anghessa </PERSON>, an Italian arms trader with links to the Italian and Swiss secret services, and he was supposed to give the pictures and letter to a third party. Prosecutor <PERSON> Ferdinando </PERSON> <PERSON> Pomarici </PERSON>, the investigation chief, said Thursday that <PERSON> Anghessa </PERSON> `` said he was working to free the hostages,'' but <PERSON> Pomarici </PERSON> expressed doubts <PERSON> Anghessa </PERSON> had been truthful. He would not elaborate. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has denied any involvement in the case. The Lebanese woman was arrested after she was found to be carrying $ 1,000 in counterfeit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bills and 50 grams -LRB- 1.7 ounces -RRB- of heroin. She said she received the pictures, documents and drugs in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> from a man called `` Shant'' who was in contact with <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, the organization linked to pro-Iranian extremist groups holding the hostages, <PERSON> Pomarici </PERSON> said. One faction with ties to <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION>, reiterated Thursday it was not connected with the woman and did not provide <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s photo. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, was seized on March 16, 1985 and is believed held by Islamic Jihad. <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>, an educator from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, was kidnapped Jan. 24, 1987 at <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>.

 Thursday was <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s 41st birthday, his fourth in captivity, and his captors released an old photograph of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist to support a statement denying links to a woman arrested in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. A statement delivered with it to a Western news agency said a photo of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> found in the possession of <PERSON> Aline </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizkallah </PERSON>, arrested in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> last week, was a reverse print of one originally released Aug. 2, 1987. Islamic Jihad, which means Islamic Holy War, claims responsibility for kidnapping <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> staff observed the birthday in his office, which they call `` <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>'s room.'' No changes have been made in it since his abduction in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on March 16, 1985, other than displaying the 13 photographs of him released by the kidnappers. Staff members sang `` Happy Birthday, Dear Terry'' and blew out the candles on a chocolate cake. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s state-run television station screened a one-minute film Thursday evening showing <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s 3-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Sulome </PERSON>, who was born after he was kidnapped. His other daughter, <PERSON> Gabrielle </PERSON>, was 10 at the time. With her hands clasped, <PERSON> Sulome </PERSON> sang, `` Happy birthday to you, dear Daddy'' and said, `` God, let Dad come to us soon.'' The videotape then showed Sulome playing with her toys while her mother's voice rose from the background and said: `` Happy birthday, dear <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>. We want you to know you're always in our hearts. Here's our daughter sending her love and hoping to see you soon Be patient darling please. God bless you.'' There was no way to tell whether <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> saw the film, although various radio stations and newspapers in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> carried advance advertisements about it for two days. In <LOCATION> Cadiz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON>, expressed hope for his release on or before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Election Day, Nov. 8. At the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said those holding hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are perpetrating `` a crime against humanity,'' according to friends and relatives of the prisoners who met with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> has been held longest of 14 foreigners still missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Most or all the captives, who include nine Americans, are believed to be in the hands of radical Shiite Moslems loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Italian police have said the photographs found in the woman's luggage were reproductions They were of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, American hostage <PERSON> Alann </PERSON> <PERSON> Steen </PERSON> and a man who was not identified. In Thursday's 22-line statement, typewritten in Arabic, <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION> said: `` A negative of the picture was taken. A photograph was printed in a reverse manner.'' Accompanying the statement were a copy of the Anderson photograph and a reverse reproduction of it. The reverse print appeared identical to the one found in Ms. <PERSON> Rizkallah </PERSON>'s possession. Also in the envelope were photocopies of the original picture as printed in the leftist <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> daily As-Safir the day after its first release last year, and of the reproduction carried by Ms. <PERSON> Rizkallah </PERSON>, as published by <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspapers. In the original, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> was looking directly into the camera with his head inclined slightly to the right. In the reproduction, his head tilts to the left. The Islamic Jihad statement said: `` The Italian government is held responsible for publishing all the details about this case. It is also accused of complicity with the so-called <PERSON> Aline </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizkallah </PERSON> in coordination with the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and American intelligence services until proven otherwise. `` We renew our threat to all local and foreign -LRB- news -RRB- agencies against manipulating and trading in the photographs and documents which we attach to our statements and which we hope they will be published in full in line with journalistic honesty.'' The statement made no reference to <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s birthday. Islamic Jihad said in a statement released Monday that Ms. <PERSON> Rizkallah </PERSON> was not involved `` in any matter related to us whatsoever.'' The group also holds American educator <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, who was abducted June 10, 1985. The spiritual head of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Sunni Moslem community, <PERSON> Grand </PERSON> <PERSON> Mufti </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON>, expressed `` regret over Mr. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s continued captivity for such a long period. In a statement given to the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday, he said: `` We plead with all those who have self respect, cherish humanitarian values and respect freedom to work for the return of all the hostages to their families.'' <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Sunni community has not been involved in taking hostages.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> recommended Thursday that the new <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> be razed and rebuilt from the ground up because it is riddled with listening devices that can not be removed. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told reporters the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has `` no choice'' in the matter `` because there's no way to rid it of the many listening devices that were built into it.'' `` We're going to start and have an American-built one,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said of the embassy. Meanwhile, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> source disclosed late Thursday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has filed claims against the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for $ 29 million in connection with `` defects and delays'' in the construction of the embassy. In April 1987, administration officials said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had filed such a claim, but the preliminary total at that time was only about $ 10 million. The claims are to be negotiated by an arbitration panel in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, noted that the $ 29 million does not include possible reparations by the Soviets for the installation of eavesdropping devices in the building or the eventual costs to replace the building. `` We're talking to the Soviets now'' in an attempt to settle how much such reparations might be, the source said, explaining that before that issue can go before the arbitration panel, `` We have to show good faith that the Soviets and we have tried to work this out.'' National security adviser <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, during an appearance at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, said `` it will be a very expensive proposition, a very, very difficult task to put up a building in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials would have to discuss the situation with Soviet officials and said he was hopeful something could be worked out `` in light of the improving relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will urge <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to permit the virtually completed embassy to be demolished and reconstructed with American-made components to be shipped from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and stored in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> warehouses under the tightest possible security. He said the building will be assembled by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> workers taken to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for that purpose. The Soviets will not be permitted to move into their newly built embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> until the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can occupy its facilities in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. He said that tearing down the existing structure and building a new one under high security conditions will involve `` a very elaborate and costly process.'' `` Obviously we're talking years,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. But he said the final cost can not now be estimated because entirely new engineering and architectural plans will have to be drawn up. He said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposed demolition and reconstruction plan was recommended by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> following several reviews of the project by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts. `` This option offers the best overall solution to the problem,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. He said the rebuilt eight-story embassy will occupy the same sit but will be different than the one recommended for demolition. The new structure will incorporate features `` to take into account what we have learned'' about Soviet eavesdropping capabilities, he said. `` Every precaution will be taken to assure the security of the process,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. But he repeatedly declined to say exactly what devices the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had discovered in the new structure or how they had been installed because `` it's never in anyone's interest to let the other guy know what you know.'' In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> TASS </ORGANIZATION> said the spying allegations were `` groundless, obviously farfetched,'' and `` Just as in previous cases ... the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration did not provide any material proof.'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said that although the cost will be high, it will be worth it to assure a secure and safe working place for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, one that will be expected to serve for at least the next half century. Meanwhile, he said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will continue to renovate the turn-of-the century embassy building it has used since the 1930's to make it safer and more secure until a new building can be occupied. The first eavesdropping bugs, in structural elements built by Soviet workers and transported to the site, were discovered by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspectors in the spring of 1987. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> agreed in 1972 to build new, larger embassies in each other's capital One member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who toured the facility, Rep. <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, said in September that $ 38 million remained in previously approved embassy-construction appropriations to dismantle the unoccupied embassy. But Rep. <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION> BDM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which inspected the facility for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said the dismantling it could cost $ 160 million. Construction of the bug-riddled embassy and studies about its future have cost nearly $ 60 million to date.

 In the closing days of the presidential race, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> keeps telling audiences `` I'm running like I'm 10 points behind.'' Actually, he's running the play-it-safe, no-surprises campaign of a front-runner. Major polls indicate <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is well ahead of Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. And <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is not tampering with what has proven to be a successful formula of bashing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a diehard liberal who is weak on crime, soft on defense and apt to raise taxes. `` This election is far from over,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told an audience of several hundred people at a stockyard rally in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, S.D. `` You've seen those national surveys but let me tell you something. I am going to continue to run like I am 10 points behind, right down to the wire, standing on the issues. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added, `` I am determined to win this election. I am not going to let up. I am not going to refuse to campaign. I'll keep going as far and as fast as is required.''

 The ballot is so bewildering in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> this year that some officials have borrowed an idea from the supermarket for the Nov. 8 election _ express lanes for those who know how they are going to vote. Even by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> standards this year's ballot is crowded, complex and confusing. There are 29 statewide propositions, and some communities have added dozens of measures and campaigns. And of course, voters also must contend with the presidential election, a senatorial contest and congressional races.

 Americans' personal incomes rose a moderate 0.5 percent in September while consumer spending turned in its weakest performance in almost a year, the government said Thursday in reports that offered fresh evidence that economic growth is slowing. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said personal consumption spending, which accounts for two-thirds of overall economic activity, was unchanged in September following a 0.6 percent August rise. It was the first time spending had failed to advance since a 0.2 percent drop in October 1987. That decline had been blamed in part on consumer anxiety from the record stock market plunge.

 Soviet officials once criticized the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space shuttle as wasteful and unreliable, but they are about to launch their own reusable orbiter that looks a lot like the American craft. Despite the similarity in appearance and design, however, the Soviets seem to have settled on different uses for their shuttle, named the Buran, which is Russian for snowstorm. For years, the Soviets would n't even admit they were developing their own shuttle, or `` chelnok,'' even though Western specialists date the program back to at least 1982. The Buran will be launched on an unmanned mission at 6:23 a.m. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> time Saturday -LRB- 11:23 p.m. EDT Friday -RRB- from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on the Central Asian steppes of the republic of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is overpaying its contractors millions of dollars a year _ perhaps up to $ 1 billion _ simply because its procurement agents are n't monitoring quarterly financial statements, an internal audit has found. While those overpayments are for the most part eventually recovered, the government is, at the very least, losing interest payments on the money from contractors and placing an additional financial burden on itself through premature payouts, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> auditors concluded. And to make matters worse, the shortcomings were clearly identified five years ago in an audit that elicited promises of improvement from the armed services, said a report by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> inspector general's office.

 The government presented its first budget designed to help the long-suffering Soviet consumer, and declared Thursday that state-run farms and companies will be shut down if they do not make profits. Inefficient central planning also is to be curtailed, in keeping with President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program of radical economic reform. Officials painted a gloomy picture of Soviet life in a burst of honesty unique to the annual two-day budget sessions of the Supreme Soviet. The national legislature's 1,500 deputies usually hear hours of dull speeches on the success of the current Five-Year Plan, but this time they were told of cramped housing, food rotting en route to stores, jammed trains during vacation periods and new equipment unused on factory floors.

 Bobbing in the big, old-fashioned tub, toes hooked over a water spout to keep from capsizing as tiny bubbles effervesce up the length of a sore spine, it's hard to worry whether this is just what the doctor ordered. `` If you do n't have anything wrong with you, if you lead a strenuous life, it's just for relaxation,'' says bathhouse attendant <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON> <PERSON> Zorn </PERSON>. Otherwise, says <PERSON> Zorn </PERSON>, who for 15 years has been drawing the water for the tub then coming back to wrap the client in a hot sheet when it's time to get out, the bubbly float on naturally carbonated water is good for arthritis, rheumatism and bad backs. The bathhouses with their white tile walls, ceiling-fans and small individual suites with the giant tubs, look as though they have n't changed from the 1930s when the state decided the area's carbonated waters were a natural resource Nothing trendy here, especially the price: $ 8.75 for the soak, room and attention. But elsewhere, spas are an old-fashioned idea gone Yuppie _ and a multimillion-dollar business. For many now, spa means the chrome and glass spot where you ride exercise machines in a fuchsia leotard. It can mean being floated in a seawater tub or swathed in an herbal wrap. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> entrepreneur who jumped in just as the water was heating up, says his travel agency has tripled in both staff and bookings since he began specializing in spa vacations a year and a half ago. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Spa-Finders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arrangements </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, estimates that in five years, the number of spas in this country has increased from 30 to 150 and is still growing. About 1.2 million Americans spend $ 700 million to $ 800 million annually going to spas, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> estimates. The majority of his clients, who spend about $ 1,000 for a week's retreat, are low-level female executives in their 30s. But is the new emphasis on physical conditioning simply a fad, or is it really good for your health? Are you ready for this? A $ 1,000 - $ 3,500 week at a spa can be as healthful as sitting at home in your rocker or taking a hot shower, say both a cardiologist and a sports psychologist `` Does it feel good to go sit in a whirlpool or a hot mineral bath? Of course, it feels good,'' says psychologist <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Margenau </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` Does it serve a medicinal purpose? I have n't seen any evidence of that.'' What about stress management? That's the new `` buzz word,'' says <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>. The experts say any form of relaxation and exercise will do if you plan for it and do it regularly. If you go off once a year, expecting an expensive vacation to be your lifeline for the next 12 months, you're in trouble. `` I like spas, they're great. But I've been to great dude ranches that I've come back from just as refreshed,'' says <PERSON> Margenau </PERSON>, the author of a new book called `` Sports Without Pressure.'' Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rippe </PERSON>, the cardiologist who heads the Exercise Physiology Laboratory at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION>, echoes that. He says people must n't delude themselves that `` they can go twice a year and make up for the excesses of the rest of the year.'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, whose agency has sent nearly 4,000 clients to spas around the world since March 1987, says the better resorts work on behavior modification. In other words, they do n't just put you in an aerobics class or stick you on a diet, `` they have a whole program on stress management and healthy living _ things to take home with you.'' Spas as places to take mineral waters go back at least as far as the <ORGANIZATION> Romans </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, people have been spa-minded for centuries. One town in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Beppu </LOCATION>, known for boiling ponds that shoot mud into the air _ gets 12 million visitors each year, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> said. In this country, traditional spas with a chic clientele were booming before the turn of the century _ places like <LOCATION> Mineral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wells </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; Hot Springs, Ark.; <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sulphur </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Calistoga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, which stands for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Saratoga </LOCATION> This <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> town, the granddaddy of American spas whose medicinal springs were discovered in the late 18th century, was long a social hot spot with its added cache of a thoroughbred racing season. Nowadays, <PERSON> Morgenau </PERSON> sees the proliferation of spas as part of a burgeoning `` stress industry.'' `` The whole business is blown up way out of proportion. There is a whole economy built up around stress reduction, the new American fads _ spas, contraptions, a $ 1,000 worth of vitamins.'' Instead of those remedies, he recommends altering day-to-day patterns to defuse pressure. Slow down, he says, take a longer lunch, schedule exercise. `` Yes, stress exists. It always has. But most of the stresses are very easily remedied.'' `` Every man's spa is his shower,'' says <PERSON> Rippe </PERSON>, the author of many medical and fitness books. The medical school professor cites his own studies and those of colleagues that indicate showers and sitting in a recliner can reduce tension and anxiety, and that blood pressure, as well, is reduced by regular programs of walking. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON>, a confirmed spa-goer, is n't interested in hearing she could have stayed home and taken a shower. `` It was wonderful,'' she said of a posh <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> spa. `` A massage was part of every day. The food, absolutely out of this world.'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>'s catalog says a week at the resort Mrs. <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON> visited also included greens fees, herbal wrap, salt-glo loofa scrub, hairdo, makeup, manicure, pedicure and lectures _ all for $ 1,970. `` A spa,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON>, president of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> public relations firm, `` means attention and luxury. `` Plush towels, beautiful locker rooms, pampering. If you have to wait for an massage appointment, they give you a cup of bouillon,'' she said. `` I ca n't imagine it was not good for you.''

<HEAD>Anti-Personnel Mines Delay Refugees' Return to Afghanistan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Anti-personnel mines designed to maim an enemy remain scattered about <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and must be cleared before more than 5 million refugees in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> can return home, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> officials say. The mines are estimated to range in number from hundreds of thousands to 5 million. Some look like toys and are small enough to fit in the palm of a person's hand. If picked up, they can blow away a hand; if stepped on, a victim can lose a foot. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizvi </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> and Humanitarian Program for Afghan refugees, said the landmines have to be found and defused before a billion-dollar rebuilding program can begin. The devices are believed to have been laid by Soviet and Afghan government forces during their nine-year war against Moslem insurgents. The insurgents also have laid a number of anti-tank devices. Teams of mine-clearing experts from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> have been in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to plan a training program designed to show Afghans how to locate, identify and defuse the mines. A $ 9-million training program is scheduled to begin shortly, <PERSON> Rizvi </PERSON> said. Clearing the mines `` is a pre-requisite to any -LRB- rebuilding -RRB- activity,'' said <PERSON> Rizvi </PERSON>. The Soviets are not a contributor to the mine-clearing effort, but they `` have assured us of their total cooperation,'' said <PERSON> Rizvi </PERSON>. Since the April signing of an accord providing for the withdrawal of more than 100,000 Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has begun mobilizing for one of the largest refugee movements in its history. <PERSON> Rizvi </PERSON> said the widespread use of the landmines `` is a comment on the people who make, sell, buy and use them.'' The U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas, known as the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION>, have been fighting the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Marxist government since it seized power in 1978. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> entered the conflict in December 1979. Fifteen different types of anti-personnel mines have been identified along with five models of anti-tank mines, <PERSON> Rizvi </PERSON> said. In addition to the anti-personnel devices that resemble toys are are scattered around villages, another common type is a bright green plastic device that looks like a butterfly and fits into the palm of a hand. <PERSON> Rizvi </PERSON> said unexploded ordnance of other kinds, such as dud bombs, also are scattered around the Afghan countryside. The first task of foreign mine-detecting experts will be to make Afghans aware of what to look for. <PERSON> Rizvi </PERSON> said children will be educated to the dangers as well. Foreign experts will train Afghans who in turn will pass on their knowledge to others, he said. Eventually, said <PERSON> Rizvi </PERSON>, an Afghan mine-clearing team would be established in most villages or cluster of villages.

<HEAD>John Schlesinger Looks for Irony</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Unlike the title character in his latest film, `` Madame Sousatzka,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> does n't see himself as a teacher. The director would rather have audiences make up their own minds. `` I hope there's plenty of irony in all my films. That's the very thing I look for,'' said the British director of `` Midnight Cowboy,'' `` Marathon Man'' and other acclaimed movies. `` It could all be disaster, but it is n't. That's kind of my attitude to life. Most of the endings I've had, there is a question mark. They're often about people determined to carry on.'' `` Madame Sousatzka,'' based on the novel by <PERSON> Bernice </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubens </PERSON>, takes place in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and stars <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLaine </PERSON> as a demanding, emotional piano teacher whose philosophy, `` I teach how to live,'' is the cause of much conflict with her students. <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> originally sought a European actress to play the Russian-born teacher, but wanted <PERSON> MacLaine </PERSON> after deciding to cast an American. `` I liked the fact that she was willing to take risks,'' he said. `` I thought she brought quite a lot to ` Terms of Endearment,' looking dreadful. She's not worried about her <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLaine </PERSON> image. I got to know that very fast.'' <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> credits <PERSON> MacLaine </PERSON>, whose work in `` Terms of Endearment'' earned her an Academy Award for best actress in 1985, with making the eccentric Sousatzka believeable. `` Sometimes when I worked on the script, I'd say, ` Oh god, she's too monstrous. But she had a way of playing the eccentricities so that it was totally part of her,'' the director said. `` She does n't play to the audience at all I think it's a most extraordinary performance.'' For the part of <PERSON> Manek </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, the 15-year-old prodigy who endures <PERSON> Sousatzska </PERSON>'s violent mood swings, <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> auditioned hundreds of actors before choosing newcomer <PERSON> Navin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chowdhry </PERSON>, who makes his film debut in the movie. <PERSON> Chowdhry </PERSON> had no musical training, but <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> nevertheless found him perfect for the part. The youngster worked with musical advisor <PERSON> Yonty </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>. In a way, <PERSON> Irina </PERSON> <PERSON> Sousatzka </PERSON> can be likened to <PERSON> Nora </PERSON> <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON>, the aging actress in `` <LOCATION> Sunset </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION>.'' Both are flamboyant on the surface and lonely underneath. <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> falls in love with a young screenwriter, <PERSON> Sousatskza </PERSON> with <PERSON> Manek </PERSON>. `` It's a love story. She's created something and now she falls in love with him,'' <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> noted. `` She's a survivor. Even if she's angry or upset. I believe it is n't so removed from people even if the subject is about music. It's all about perfectly common human experience.'' The 62-year-old <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>'s own musical background attracted him to the story. His father was a cellist, his mother a violinist, and <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> himself was an accomplished pianist as a child. <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> was a character actor in the 1950s, appearing on stage, in television and films. He also made documentary shorts. His first commercial film, `` Terminus,'' won the Golden Lion for best documentary at the 1961 <ORGANIZATION> Venice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION>. `` A Kind of Loving,'' his first feature film, was released the following year. Starring a then unknown <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>, the film won the Golden Bear Award at the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Film Festival and established <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> as one of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s most talented young directors. He then directed `` Billy Liar'' and `` Darling,'' which earned <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> the best actress Oscar in 1965. `` Midnight Cowboy,'' his first film made in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, earned Academy Awards for best picture, director and best adapted screenplay in 1969. With <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Voight </PERSON> as a Texan hustler and <PERSON> Dustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> as a tubercular <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> con man, `` Midnight Cowboy'' typified <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>'s fascination with characters who are `` up against it. <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> sees that theme running strongly in `` Madame Sousatzka.'' `` In the case of <PERSON> Manek </PERSON>, he's up against the promise of success and the possibility of failure which she has been up against,'' he said. `` She's up against her past. She's up against it in many ways. It makes her behave a certain way. `` They're all up against something. Changing <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, changing values.'' <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> has also directed <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in `` Sunday, Bloody Sunday'' and <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> and Sir <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> in `` Marathon Man.'' `` Enthusiasm,'' the director says, is what he looks for from his actors. <PERSON> MacLaine </PERSON>, he said, loved the role. `` She ... did n't care about the money, was charming to everyone, particularly the boy. The fact that's she's out banging the drum about the movie proves she's enthusiastic. And so is <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>. He's merged his great loves, film and music, and feels the movie expresses certain things he feels. `` It's communicating,'' he said. `` You're trying to invoke an emotional response to something, to make them laugh or make them angry as well as just telling a story.''

<HEAD>Ayn Rand Epic Makes It to American Cinema 46 Years Late</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By Theasa Tuohy</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In an adventure with almost as many twists and plot turns as the movie itself, <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Rand </PERSON>'s `` We the Living'' is about to make it to American theaters. The 46-year-old film was thought to have been destroyed by <PERSON> Mussolini </PERSON>. `` We The Living'' was made in war-time <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> in 1942, and was based on the novel of the same name by Ayn Rand, whose `` objectivism'' philosphy in such works as `` The Fountainhead'' and `` Atlas Shrugged'' made her a cult figure in the 1970s. The movie has caused such a stir over the years, and has repeatedly won critical acclaim, from the Venice Festival of 1942 to the <ORGANIZATION> Fourth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Annual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> last month. A surface indictment of communism, the lushly photographed, romantic saga is set in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> as the tidal wave of revolution boiled down to a new party system that meant enormous changes in the way people lived and loved and survived. <PERSON> Rossano </PERSON> <PERSON> Brazzi </PERSON> co-stars as a tubercular aristocat who ca n't get a job or a slot in a sanitarium because aristocrats are out of fashion. He said he made arrangements for Rand to get her first look at the film when he met her in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> after the war. However, he did n't think <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s fascist government had ordered the movie to be destroyed. It went out of circulation because the `` natural life of the film was over,'' <PERSON> Brazzi </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his home in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Massimo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrara-Santamaria </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> lawyer who was general manager of the studio where the movie was made, said he was called before a fascist tribunal and ordered to destroy negatives and copies of the film, and was stripped of his position at the studio and as lecturer at Italian universities for his role in making the movie. `` In the tragic Italian war situation, the film was called by the public ` <PERSON> Noi </PERSON> <PERSON> Morti </PERSON>' -LRB- ` We the Dead' -RRB-,'' he said in an interview, adding that Nazi propaganda minister <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Goebbels </PERSON> banned the film in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Ferrara </PERSON> personally showed it at <PERSON> Goebbels </PERSON>' <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> home in October 1942. `` At the end of the screening, <PERSON> Goebbels </PERSON> told me that the Russians were habitually presented to the German public in a much more negative way than in this picture, and therefore it was no good for <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Erika </PERSON> and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON>, the movie's producers, were Rand's lawyers in the 1960s Mrs. <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON> said the author believed the banning story and authorized a search for the film that took the two attorneys through hundreds of interviews and dusty archives. It finally culminated two years later when they met a dealer with `` a bunch of Italian films for sale.'' They rode through the bumpy back streets of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> with a load of potentially explosive nitrate-treated film in the back of an old truck, including the negative for `` We the Living.'' They had the movie transferred to `` safety film'' before flying it back to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON> believes they found the original nitrate negative, which <PERSON> Ferrara </PERSON> had hidden. <PERSON> Ferrara </PERSON> and others say <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Culture </ORGANIZATION> ordered the film destroyed about five months after its release on the grounds that though the message might purport to be anti-communist, it could also be taken as anti-totalitarian _ a strong statement for individualism, regardless of political coloration. The fascists did n't want that kind of propaganda message playing on the homefront with <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s Axis troops stretched from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Stalingrad </LOCATION>, and the Allies storming the beaches of <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>. Rand had a hard-line, libertarian philosophy. It was best exemplified by <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> in the `` Fountainhead,'' who played an architect who blows up his own creation rather than allow it to be desecrated by the whims of popularism. Mrs. <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON> said Rand liked the film version of `` We the Living'' even more than `` The Fountainhead,'' although the author had written the latter's screenplay herself and was not asked for permission for the Italian film. <PERSON> Brazzi </PERSON> said it was a so-called war movie: `` We'll worry after the war about paying for it.'' He said Rand eventually did receive compensation from <PERSON> Scalera </PERSON>, the producing studio. Mrs. <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON> said that once she and her husband recovered an original nitrate negative, Rand went through the film frame by frame to identify exactly how she wanted it edited. The Italian version was made in two parts and ran over 4 -LCB- hours. The project was set aside when Rand had other commitments, and was not picked up until after the author's death in 1982. The film was restored by <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. The epic was shot entirely on indoor, elaborately built Italian war-time sets recreating Russian country scenes, trains, ships and <LOCATION> Petrograd </LOCATION>. `` I'm told almost the entire White Russian community in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> was used as extras,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON> said. The new version, distributed by <PERSON> Angelika </PERSON> <PERSON> Films </PERSON>, is under three hours, and is set for release Nov. 5 in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, Nov. 11 in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and Nov. 25 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. It will play to other major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets before January. The film also stars a young and radiant <PERSON> Alida </PERSON> <PERSON> Valli </PERSON>, the female lead in the 1949 British thriller, `` The Third Man''; and <PERSON> Fosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Giachetti </PERSON>, who was the No. 1 box-office draw in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> when the movie was made, according to its producers. `` We the Living'' has a bit of soap opera in it: Beautiful <PERSON> Kira </PERSON> loves <PERSON> Leo </PERSON>, the tubercular aristocat; <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> of the dreaded secret police loves <PERSON> Kira </PERSON> because she has the courage to be independent and defiant of the new order. But underneath the suds is a hard reality: <PERSON> Kira </PERSON> forsakes her love when he turns out not tough enough to toe a moral line. <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> kills himself when he realizes first that <PERSON> Kira </PERSON> used him to get <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> a spot in a sanitarium, and that his adored party leaves no freedom for individuals to decide whether they wish to be scoundrel or saint. <PERSON> Kira </PERSON> goes forward, wiser but unbowed, a testimony to the strong and the living, and the survival of the toughest. Rand, who espoused a personal philosophy based on unfettered capitalism and `` rational selfishness,'' held individual freedom as the highest ideal. She said alturism was weakness, and blamed it for much of the world's woes. But she also attacked libertarians of the right who often identified with her philosophy.

<HEAD>Despite Paradoxes, Brecker Finds Niche as Solo Jazzman</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 After dazzling a nightclub audience with his work on an ultramodern electronic wind instrument, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Brecker </PERSON> went to his dressing room to audition a 40-year-old saxophone that a friend had offered to sell. Such paradoxes make up the music of <PERSON> Brecker </PERSON>, a popular sessionman who has played on more than 500 albums but is guiding his solo career through its infancy. <PERSON> Brecker </PERSON> has lent his licks to albums by such diverse artists as <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>, Parliament-Funkadelic and Dire Straits, but his two solo records are filled with lengthy improvisations and traditional jazz sounds. He is known primarily for his studio work but loves to perform live. As a horn man, his influences begin with the masters: jazz saxophonists such as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Coltrane </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>. A recent favorite is blues guitarist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cray </PERSON>, who won critical acclaim last year with his hit record, `` Smoking Gun.'' But to go from pop to funk to rock, from bebop to blues is not unusual for the 39-year-old <PERSON> Brecker </PERSON>. `` My music is always heading in a bunch of different directions,'' he said. With his brother, <PERSON> Randy </PERSON>, who plays trumpet, the tenor saxophonist was one-half of the <ORGANIZATION> Brecker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>, who recorded several successful albums of fusion pop in the 1970s. But <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> was 20 years into his career before he released a solo album, last year's `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Brecker </PERSON>. The current tour that brought his quintet to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> is in support of his new record, `` Do n't Try This at Home.'' `` The two albums are somewhat different but coming from sort of the same place,'' <PERSON> Brecker </PERSON> said. `` They're both not at all commercial in a pop sense. `` I really wanted to make a jazz record _ basically an acoustic type record that was played fairly live in the studio with tunes that were open to allow for a lot of improvisation. I was n't trying to employ gimmicks. I just wanted the music to speak for itself.'' On stage and on his new record, <PERSON> Brecker </PERSON> brings a contemporary flavor to the otherwise traditional sound with his electronic wind instrument synthesizer, or <ORGANIZATION> EWI </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- pronounced ee-wee -RRB-. The <ORGANIZATION> EWI </ORGANIZATION> is the length of a clarinet, but fatter and rectangular. It has 10 octave keys and terrific dynamic range. <PERSON> Brecker </PERSON> can make it sound like a keyboard, a guitar, cattle in distress and even a saxophone. The <ORGANIZATION> EWI </ORGANIZATION> is likely to appall conservative jazz fans. <PERSON> Brecker </PERSON> likes it for several reasons. `` I'm kind of a gadget freak. I've always liked electronic things and was into synthesizers long before I was playing the EWI. It's just a lot of fun to play,'' he said `` And I use it as a writing tool. It's just opened up another creative door for me.'' But <PERSON> Brecker </PERSON> will always go back to the sax. `` It's become part of me,'' he said. <PERSON> Brecker </PERSON> has n't done much session work lately and plans to continue concentrating on his solo career. He likes the independence and plans to make the most of it. `` The -LRB- next -RRB- recording is probably going to be somewhat more electric, a little more funky. That's subject to change. But if I do do something different, I expect to get a degree of lambasting,'' he said with a chuckle. `` Hopefully the records are going to sell. But I'm not trying to let that affect what I record.''

 Seething hatred of the Jews, fanned by <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s propagandists, exploded 50 years ago in the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>' well-coordinated night of ransacking, torching and beating called `` Kristallnacht.'' Boastfully dubbed Crystal Night by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> because of the sparkling shards of glass from thousands of smashed windows, that single night of terror was also the dawn of the murderous seven-year Holocaust. The Nazis eventually killed an estimated 6 million Jews and hundreds of thousands of others they labeled `` undesirables.'' Throughout the Third Reich on the night of Nov. 9-10, 1938, <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> rampaged against Jews in major cities as well as those few left in small towns after years of persecution. The balance of the terrifying destruction, according to official <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> count: 195 synagogues and 7,500 businesses destroyed, thousands of homes ransacked. Officially, 36 Jews were slain, some as they fled burning buildings. Other accounts, however, indicate that at least 1,118 synagogues were vandalized and as many as 1,000 Jews were killed or committed suicide. Thousands more Jews _ men, women and children _ were beaten. More than 30,000 were arrested and shipped off to concentration camps in the first major step in the systematic Nazi campaign to annihilate European Jews. The action, which became known as the `` Night of Broken Glass'' in English, stunned the outside world and bluntly heralded the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>' intentions to `` Aryanize'' society and business. Germans in both East and West have for months been making elaborate plans to mark the 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht, including solemn ceremonies, panel discussions and new publications. Even half a century later, the memory of the terror haunts its victims. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Jachmann </PERSON> was an 11-year-old in the town of <LOCATION> Arnswalde </LOCATION> _ now <LOCATION> Choszczno </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` We were sleeping behind shutters with the windows closed,'' <PERSON> Jachmann </PERSON> recalled in an interview. `` We were jerked out of our sleep by the crashing glass. We heard the screams: ` The synaogue is burning!' `` My father screamed, ` Yes, the sky's all red!' We lived just 500 meters from the synagogue. We were hiding behind him for three hours. We were shaking from fear and terror. Uniformed <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> rushed into our house. They arrested my father without saying a word,'' he said. `` My sister, <PERSON> Gerda </PERSON>, and I were crying terribly,'' added the 61-year-old <PERSON> Jachmann </PERSON>, now head of the Jewish home for the elderly in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. `` My sister, mother and I had to leave Arnswalde within three days.'' <PERSON> Jachmann </PERSON>'s mother, father and 13-year-old sister all died in the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> concentration camp. <PERSON> Jachmann </PERSON>, also sent to <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>, later saved himself by plunging into the snow when Nazi machine-gunners mowed down prisoners in January 1945. In what the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> called `` spontaneous anti-Jewish demonstrations,'' Kristallnacht raged across the German <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>, including <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and the recently annexed Sudetenland region of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. In addition to homes, businesses and synagogues, the Nazi gangs ransacked Jewish hospitals, orphanages and homes for the elderly. In the city of <LOCATION> Erfurt </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Weimar </LOCATION>, all Jewish men aged 18 to 80 were rounded up and forced into a local gymnasium. `` Some of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> especially took to task Jews whom they personally knew, to vent their fury on them,'' said local B'nai B'rith president <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>. `` We had to line up and march around to the sounds of the <LOCATION> Horst-Wessel </LOCATION> song -LRB- a Nazi favorite -RRB-. Then we were commanded to scream ` Death to the Jews'' and we had to do it,'' said <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>. Some were savagely beaten with whips, he said. `` Then we were loaded into buses and brought to <LOCATION> Buchenwald </LOCATION>, where we arrived at dawn,'' <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> recalled in historian <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Benz </PERSON>'s recently published book, `` The Jews in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> 1933-45. In other cities, Jews were herded into courtyards before the men were separated from their families and sent to concentration camps. <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Senger </PERSON>, then a non-practicing Jew from a staunchly Communist family, witnessed the outcome of Kristallnacht in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, where some of the worst violence took place. `` On the morning of the 10th, I went to the factory where I worked, and on the way to the factory, I ran into a secretary. She said: ` Have you heard the synagogue is burning?''' he recalled. <PERSON> Senger </PERSON> described the mushroom cloud of smoke coming from the direction of the Boerneplatz. When he reached the synagogue, he said smoke was billowing from the roof, flames leaping through the windows. `` Hundreds of people were standing nearby,'' he said. `` The area was blocked off by police. The fire department was there, but they were n't trying to put out the fire. They had instructions to let the synagogue burn, but to keep nearby buildings from burning. `` I stood there and never heard any words of approval or applause or bravos. The people looked stiffly and silently into the fire. No one critcized it either. The fear was too great. `` That was the first time I felt I belonged to them, I belonged there, that's my people. My synagogue was burning. I really felt that I was a Jew,'' the 69-year-old retired journalist told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> in an interview. `` I saw they were rounding up the Jews and putting them on trucks, that same day. The Jews were being mistreated and beaten.'' <PERSON> Senger </PERSON> survived in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> by hiding from the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> and using false documents. Much to the annoyance of Nazi finance chief <PERSON> Hermann </PERSON> <PERSON> Goering </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Kristallnacht </ORGANIZATION> had an unforeseen and nearly disastrous impact. The damage, calculated at 25 million reichsmarks, worth about $ 6.25 million, shocked German insurance companies. They noted that just replacing the broken glass would hurt the Third Reich, since the glass had to be imported with much-needed hard currency. `` I wish you had killed 200 Jews instead of destroying so many valuables,'' <PERSON> Goering </PERSON> told <PERSON> Reinhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Heydrich </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> fanatic who gave the Teletyped orders for Kristallnacht. Eventually, the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> confiscated the insurance proceeds and slapped the Jews with a $ 250 million fine. Fifty years later, the anniversary is still creating conflict, including debate over the best way to mark the day and the extent to which government leaders should participate. Roman Catholic bishops from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> last month issued a joint statement that sharply questioned <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> leaders' failure 50 years ago to publicly condemn the Nazi night of terror. The bishops implied that <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> `` failings'' were partly responsible for the Holocaust. In September, <PERSON> Ignaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Bubis </PERSON>, leader of the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> Jewish Community, stunned the government when he publicly urged Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> to have President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> write <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s speech <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> has occasionally upset West German Jews with what they consider insensitivity toward their concerns. <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON>, on the other hand, has gained the Jews' admiration for urging Germans to face the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> past. West German Jews also frequently object to the word Kristallnacht, saying it minimizes the atrocities that followed the rampages. They prefer the term `` Pogrom Night.'' When the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> came to power in 1933, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> had 530,000 Jews. About 32,000 Jews live in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> today. In <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the estimated number of practicing Jews is 450-600, with no permanent rabbi.

 <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and his henchmen had for years been targeting Jews for persecution, trying to force them out of the Third Reich. By November 1938, they were looking for an excuse to crack down more savagely. They found it when <PERSON> Herschel </PERSON> <PERSON> Grynszpan </PERSON>, a 17-year-old <PERSON> Jew </PERSON> enraged by his family's deportation to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, shot and mortally wounded German Embassy Third Secretary <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> vom </PERSON> <PERSON> Rath </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on Nov. 7, 1938. Nazi leaders, in Teleptyped orders sent to local party heads throughout the <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>, demanded brutal reprisals. In the Nazi capital alone, seven main synagogues were burned in the hours of ransacking and wanton violence. Here are brief descriptions of some of what happened in just nine of the hundreds of other towns and cities where Nazi thugs ransacked Jewish homes and businesses and burned synagogues on the night of Nov. 9-10, 1938.

 As in hundreds of other towns across <LOCATION> Nazi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, terror struck Jews in this picturesque village on the infamous `` Kristallnacht.'' A half-century later, students there are still confronting the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> past. Last month, the 23 students in <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolb </PERSON>'s history class heard a former Jewish resident describe the tensions that led up to the brutality of Nov. 9-10, 1938. Later, in a roundtable discussion with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, students in this town of 11,400 people north of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> discussed the night when thugs ransacked the homes of the 10 to 15 Jews who lived in <LOCATION> Usingen </LOCATION>, then a rural village. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Stenzel </PERSON>, 18, said Kristallnacht, named for the sparkling shards of broken glass that littered streets and sidewalks after the vandalism, was a `` channeling of aggression'' against the Jews. Asked about constant reminders of Kristallnacht and other Nazi atrocities, he said: `` There is the danger the Nazi era could be disposed of, or settled in a way. But this history should always be alive.'' <PERSON> Stenzel </PERSON> also sees sharp differences among generations in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which has paid more than 80 billion marks -LRB- $ 44 billion at 1988 values -RRB- to Nazi victims and their families. `` The older generation has kept the prejudiced view of Jews,'' he said, adding that this was n't true with younger generations. <PERSON> Sonja </PERSON> <PERSON> Moses </PERSON>, 20, said: `` I can well imagine there were feelings of jealousy because the Jews were merchants and in general were better off financially. But I just do n't think it could happen again. People are more broad-minded now. They would n't do it again.'' None of the six students taking part in the Oct. 13 discussion at the <ORGANIZATION> Christian-Wirth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> was Jewish. All are working toward the Abitur, the examination which grants a prestigious diploma roughly equivalent to a junior college degree in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Moses </PERSON>, like her classmates, also said the older generation views the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> era far differently from today's younger Germans. `` My grandmother tells me that <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> brought order to the country,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Moses </PERSON>, adding that her grandmother dwells on the chaos that plagued the <LOCATION> Weimar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> after World War I. `` She says after <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> came to power, it was n't that way anymore. You could walk down the street without being afraid.'' <PERSON> Albrecht </PERSON> <PERSON> Pachl </PERSON>, 18, agreed the `` biggest danger'' was that the legacy of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> could eventually be put aside. But he, too, noted that some Germans think it is time to stop dwelling on the past. `` Many people feel under attack, including from people outside the country,'' <PERSON> Pachl </PERSON> said of Holocaust reminders. He said he remembered watching television documentaries as a child. `` I had the feeling it was aimed at me as a German,'' <PERSON> Pachl </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kerstin </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumke </PERSON>, 18, said of Kristallnacht violence, `` I can imagine that some people were swept up by what was happening, even if they did n't have any hatred for the Jews beforehand.'' Like the others interviewed, Ms. <PERSON> Dumke </PERSON> has traveled to other countries, and she said the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> past comes up there, too. `` There's less interest in what is happening today than what happened in the past. It's something that you drag around with you all the time,'' she said. The students had heard from <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilienstein </PERSON>, 67, an <LOCATION> Usingen </LOCATION> native who emigrated a year before that terrible night. A retired <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> educator, <PERSON> Lilienstein </PERSON> studied at the <ORGANIZATION> Christian-Wirth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> more than 50 years ago, according to the 42-year-old <PERSON> Kolb </PERSON>. `` For some of them, it was the first time they'd ever seen a Jew, knowing it was a Jew. Certainly, it was the first time many had really talked to a Jew,'' <PERSON> Kolb </PERSON> said. In a telephone interview from his home in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lilienstein </PERSON> said of his meeting: `` I was amazed both at their lack of knowledge about what really happened, but also at their interest in questioning me.''

 The scope of death and destruction in the Kristallnacht pogrom against the Jews of the Third Reich 50 years ago was much broader than widely believed, an Israeli researcher says. Vandals torched synagogues and smashed Jewish property the night of Nov. 9-10, 1938. The next day, <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> officials announced that 36 Jews had been killed and 195 synagogues destroyed. These figures are still widely used in history books. But <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> professor <PERSON> Meier </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> says he has uncovered evidence that about 1,000 Jews were killed or committed suicide, and that at least 1,118 synagogues were vandalized. Kristallnacht is considered the start of the Holocaust, the systematic destruction of European Jewry by <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. By the end of World War II, the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> had killed 6 million Jews. `` For German Jews, it was the final sign that they no longer had a place there,'' said the German-born <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON>, the only member of his family to survive the Holocaust. `` After the Kristallnacht, we all understood what it means to be a target.'' <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> said he began his research four years ago after being angered by official indifference on a visit to his birthplace, the southern German city of <LOCATION> Nuremberg </LOCATION>, once a hotbed of Nazism. `` I was at city hall, and asked some official why there was no plaque to commemorate the Adas-Isroel synagogue where my family prayed,'' said <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON>. `` They told me it never existed.'' <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> was 12 when he saw Adas-Isroel go up in flames on <LOCATION> Kristallnacht </LOCATION>. Later that night, five <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Shirts </PERSON> trashed the <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> family apartment with axes and knives. The newspaper `` Nuernberger Zeitung'' wrote about the destruction of Adas-Isroel, an ornate three-story building with tall arched windows: `` A heap of broken benches and ritual equipment was set up in the middle of the building which was then set on fire. The entire building burned down.'' Scenes like this were repeated throughout the <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>, mostly in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Nuremberg </LOCATION>, 15 stormtroopers broke into the apartment of <PERSON> Else </PERSON> <PERSON> Dormitzer </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Sigmund </PERSON>, smashing furniture. `` Later, several bandits returned and beat us both. They broke my husband's nose with a steel rod,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dormitzer </PERSON> wrote in an account kept at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. `` We were pushed out into the street, our bodies covered with blood.'' <PERSON> Hertha </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtig </PERSON> said she had just seen a <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Eddy-Jeanette </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> movie and was riding home on a streetcar in <LOCATION> Breslau </LOCATION> _ today's <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> _ when she saw <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> Shirts smash display windows. `` They spared my husband for two days, but on the third day he did not return from work,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hurtig </PERSON>, who now lives in Ramat Gan near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview. Mrs. <PERSON> Hurtig </PERSON>'s late husband was one of 30,000 Jews rounded up in the days after Kristallnacht and sent to concentration camps. According to <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON>, 500 Jews died on Kristallnacht, either killed or pushed into suicide, and 500 more perished in concentration camps in the following days. In addition, at least 1,095 synagogues were torched or vandalized in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and 23 others in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> said in an interview. The figures are the result of painstaking research. Using a 1932 guide to Jewish communities in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> and a few volunteers wrote letters to German municipal officials, asking for information about the local synagogue and an account of what happened in each town and village on <LOCATION> Kristallnacht </LOCATION>. About 60 percent of the municipalities responded. <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> also received information from German-born Jews now living in other countries. The Nazis tried to portray the rampaging as the result of popular anger over the assassination of <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> vom </PERSON> <PERSON> Rath </PERSON>, third secretary at the <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, by <PERSON> Hershel </PERSON> <PERSON> Grynszpan </PERSON>, a Polish Jew. <PERSON> Vom </PERSON> <PERSON> Rath </PERSON> was shot Nov. 7 and died two days later. But <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> and other historians say a large-scale pogrom had been planned for several months, with the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> waiting for the right time to carry it out. Still, <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> said, German Jews, the most assimilated and secular in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, were taken by surprise. `` They said, ` We are Germans, and this will pass,''' <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> recalled. `` They said, ` The world will not keep quiet.''' As history knows, they were wrong.

 The flames that consumed synagogues across the Third Reich 50 years ago still burn within hearts at <ORGANIZATION> Congregation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Habonim </ORGANIZATION>, where survivors of the Nazi assault on the Jews rebuilt their lives and their faith. An altar is built of stones from synagogues demolished the night of Nov. 9-10, 1938 _ Kristallnacht, or the Night of Broken Glass. A charred Torah scroll hangs on the wall, its Hebrew characters twisted as if in agony. The congregation is a monument as well. Rabbi <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON>, who escaped <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> as a teen-ager in 1937, estimates that more than 65 percent of the synagogue's members are survivors of the Nazi era. The synagogue was founded on the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> on Nov. 9, 1939, precisely a year after Kristallnacht. Its name, Hebrew for `` the builders,'' was a defiant answer to those who had destroyed the synagogues, the shops, the homes and the comfortable lives of German Jewry. `` Still, after 50 years, one can not believe that any civilized nation could do what was done,'' <PERSON> Lotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Habonim </ORGANIZATION>'s executive director, said in an interview. She remembers seeing the synagogue of Mannheim aflame. She recalls streets littered with glass, days spent hiding in her family's home, the subsequent arrest of her brother and his transport to the <LOCATION> Dachau </LOCATION> concentration camp. Mrs. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> gained her brother's release with forged papers. She herself spent time in a concentration camp in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> before fleeing to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>, 76, also remembers. She and her husband were awakened by a 2:30 a.m. call from her mother-in-law: `` Get out of your apartment right away, the furniture is flying through the windows!'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> took shelter with her parents while her husband set out in search of a safer place, hoping the violence was isolated to <LOCATION> Dortmund </LOCATION>. But chaos and <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> hooligans were everywhere. He holed up in a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> church and returned two days later. All the Jewish men of Dortmund were arrested, including Mrs. <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>'s husband, father and uncle. Her menfolk were released in a fortnight: `` If you ask me why they were let out ... I can not tell you to this day,'' she said. <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> <PERSON> Boettigheimer </PERSON> remembers the melancholy among Jews in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` Too many of our people lost so much _ their parents, relatives, friends were caught in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and it became more and more obvious that there was no way to get them out,'' said <PERSON> Boettigheimer </PERSON>, 80, a <ORGANIZATION> Habonim </ORGANIZATION> founder who arrived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1936. `` But there was also a sense of hope. We were alive.'' That hope was marshaled by <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, a charismatic rabbi who had watched as <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> marauders wrecked his <LOCATION> Essen </LOCATION> synagogue. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and his followers were determined that German Judaism would endure. <PERSON> Habonim </PERSON> started with three dozen founding members and services at <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s Central Synagogue. It drew some of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s leading intellectuals, people like <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Buber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Baeck </PERSON>, to lecture and teach. A prominent Bible expert from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, came to <ORGANIZATION> Habonim </ORGANIZATION> and resumed his lessons at the precise point where he had been interrupted by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. `` It grew by leaps and bounds, like wildfire,'' said <PERSON> Boettigheimer </PERSON>. `` There was a need for prayer _ there always is in time of trouble.'' Membership swelled to 1,200. Separate services were conducted in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> was rented for the High Holy Days. The German Jews began to assimilate. The amount of German spoken at services diminished until it was eliminated in the 1950s; board minutes were recorded in German for only a year or two. `` We tried to hide our language,'' Boettigheimer explained. The end of the war brought numbing news of what had happened to those left behind. Memorializing the dead became a major priority. Each year, a Holocaust memorial service is held near the anniversary of <LOCATION> Kristallnacht </LOCATION>. A wall of plaques records names of the dead: `` <PERSON> Tilly </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> perished in Theresienstadt March 1943.'' `` Emil and <ORGANIZATION> Lima </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Adolph </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> and <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Hertz </PERSON>, perished in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> 1940-45.'' Stones were collected from the synagogue ruins after the war; nearly 30 years later, artist <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Milstein </PERSON> incorporated them in an altar as a monument to victims of the Holocaust. The charred Torah scroll was discovered in the gutter outside the <LOCATION> Essen </LOCATION> synagogue the night after it was destroyed. It was sent for safekeeping to a relative in <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, who gave it to physicist <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>. <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>, who had emigrated from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1933, displayed it when he spoke on behalf of refugee relief. Eventually, it went to <ORGANIZATION> Habonim </ORGANIZATION>. In a <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> cemetery, <ORGANIZATION> Habonim </ORGANIZATION> is about to dedicate a marble column etched with victims' names. A brochure says, `` We will never forget them, but let us be sure that those who come after us will remember them, too.'' The synagogue has had its struggles. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, the synagogue's founder and its heart, died in 1967, replaced by <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON>, his son-in-law and an associate rabbi Membership dropped to 600, and religious school enrollment, once as high as 250, fell to 50. It is 60 this year. <ORGANIZATION> Habonim </ORGANIZATION> has attracted new, younger members, but they are in the minority. `` These people do n't die,'' <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> said of the older members. `` Fiftieth wedding anniversaries are a dime a dozen in my congregation.'' But they do die, of course, and the congregation shrinks some each year. The names of those who perished in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are read at the annual memorial service; they are removed when their survivors die. This year, there will be about 100 names. This does not sadden <PERSON> Boettigheimer </PERSON>. `` It is much sadder,'' he said, `` if you have a tremendous list.''

 Compared to the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> genocide that virtually wiped out <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s Jews, a night of window-smashing and arson would seem a pale subject for a documentary. But `` Kristallnacht: The Journey from 1938 to 1988'' spotlights a moment in history when history could have been changed. The world was shocked, but did nothing, and <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s destruction of the Jews went forward. The one-hour film will air over the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> on Nov. 9, the 50th anniversary of `` crystal night,'' when widespread Nazi attacks on synagogues and Jewish businesses and homes littered the streets with shattered glass. `` It was <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s last test to see how the world would react, and the world reacted with silence,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON>, who underwrote the film through his <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lauder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a philanthropic organization that aims to preserve European Jewish history and culture. <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON>, heir to the <PERSON> Estee </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON> cosmetics fortune, served as ambassador to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> from 1985-87, and was an outspoken critic of anti-Semitism at a time when Austrians were electing former <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> as their president in spite of his Nazi background. <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON> told a small group that gathered for a preview screening of the documentary that its purpose was `` to teach us a lesson that we have to speak out, speak out whenever there is any type of bigotry government-sponsored, any type of religious persecution.'' The film describes the events through rare pictures, including never-before-seen amateur movies of the burning of a synagogue, and interviews with survivors and witnesses. It later catches up with present-day Austrians and Germans who have varying opinions on their connection to the past. Kristallnacht is well-known in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON> said he was chagrined to find out that only about 10 percent of Americans polled by his foundation had ever heard of it. `` It became part of me when I was in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>,'' he said in an interview. `` I began to realize all the different currents, why they were happening. I also saw in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> there were very few synagogues left. One of the major ones ... is today a parking lot. I realized that this was a center of Jewish life, and there's a parking lot. What happened? `` After Nov. 9, 1938, the world was never the same,'' <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON> said. `` There was something different. People could n't put their finger on it, but it was different. It affects your life, it affects my life, it affects all our lives. And that's why I did it. I wanted people to understand it. And no matter how much I explained to people when I travel what happened, I could n't get it across.'' For producer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Frye </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> producer, making <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON>'s film was a difficult project, since little visual material was available. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> did n't want any evidence of the widespread nature of this,'' <PERSON> Frye </PERSON> said. He held little hope for film footage until someone tipped him there was an amateur film sitting in a museum in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` That began a three-four-month process,'' <PERSON> Frye </PERSON> said. `` No one would tell us who owned the film. After leaving <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> on the actual shoot, we drove to <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> and on the way found out ... that the woman who owned the film lived near. So we knocked on the door and completed the deal. It is, as far as I know, the only footage that shows in motion picture terms what happened.'' The film sets the scene through interviews with witnesses who lived in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1935 as <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> was rising to power and finding little resistance to his propaganda campaign against Jews. A Polish family forced to leave <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> wrote a plaintive letter to a son in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. To protest the persecution of his family, 17-year-old <PERSON> Herschel </PERSON> <PERSON> Grynzspan </PERSON> walked into the <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and shot a minor German official, <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> vom </PERSON> <PERSON> Rath </PERSON>. Retribution for <PERSON> vom </PERSON> <PERSON> Rath </PERSON>'s death became an excuse for Kristallnacht. `` This was for good, we knew. The end of our normal life,'' recalls witness <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>. In present-day <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Frye </PERSON>'s cameras follow Israeli professor <PERSON> Meier </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> on his quest to find evidence of the Jews who once lived in the <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> of his boyhood. In <LOCATION> Ansbach </LOCATION>, he watches workmen restoring a magnificent synagogue. `` The main thing is to restore what happened here,'' <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> says. `` To make a memory for our parents.'' But he acknowledges there is no one to worship in the synagogue. No Jews live in <LOCATION> Ansbach </LOCATION> anymore.

<HEAD>Nissan Sentra Is Tough Little Car</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto and LaserGraphic</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>

 The Nissan Sentra is a tough little car with a tough assignment. It has to battle both similarly priced subcompact cars and lower-priced competitors. It works to attract both young singles of moderate income and upscale parents and couples, <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> says. And, as the best-selling auto in the <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> family, it's working to bolster sales. The Sentra, which is imported from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for buyers in the western <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and is shipped from <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, plant to buyers in the eastern part of the country, has done a commendable job. Redesigned for the 1987 model year, it was the eighth best-selling nameplate in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with sales of more than 239,000. Also in the 1987 model year, it was rated No. 1 in quality among subcompacts by the auto marketing research firm J.D. Power and Associates of <LOCATION> Westlake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. For 1988, the Sentra continues to be a quality leader in subcompacts, though it fell behind the Chevrolet Nova, <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corolla </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colt </ORGANIZATION> in the 1988 J.D Power survey of owners who had their cars for 90 days. Also, a <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> spokesman reports that sales are nearly flat for calendar 1988. Through July, 123,625 Sentras were sold vs. 124,468 in the same period in 1987. The test car, a 1988 Sentra GXE sedan, had fine fit and finish inside and out, except for the plastic fuel-cap holder on the fuel filler door. The holder came right off when I tried to use it. But it also was easy to put back on. I ignored it and put the cap on the car roof while refueling. The car's interior was spartan and easy to live with. Dashboard gauges were simple to read and seats were comfortable. Because it is a subcompact, however, the Sentra offers a snug fit for three adults in back, and legroom there also was tight. The trunk was flat and sizable, though it was covered with a thin layer of material that tended to bunch up under luggage. Road noise was moderate, and you can count on getting decent fuel economy. The engine, a 1.6-liter, fuel-injected four cylinder teamed with three-speed automatic transmission, was a bit sluggish. There were times when it chugged and the car jerked, trying to get in the right gear. This was also when the air conditioner was on full blast. Base price for the GXE sedan with automatic transmission is $ 10,844. Competitors include the Honda Civic sedan, which is priced around $ 11,000 with automatic transmission, and the <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Excel </ORGANIZATION> sedan, which is priced around $ 7,400 with automatic transmission. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> says Sentra buyers have median age of between 30 and 39. Median income is from $ 30,000 to just under $ 50,000. Many buyers are couples and parents, and there also are a number of single females who earn more than $ 50,000 annually, the company says. From 1982-86, the latest years available, Consumer Reports' trouble survey of owners showed Sentras having average, better than average or much better than average ratings

<HEAD>Bush's Campaign Strategy: `I'm Not Going to Mess Up'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, relaxing on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Two as it raced across <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, summed up his campaign strategy in just six words: `` I'm not going to mess up.'' Once, twice, three times, four times _ he said it over and over within a period of a minute. It was as if he had been reciting the same sentence to himself for months, rehearsing a simple formula for winning the White House. `` I ca n't look back and I ca n't look forward beyond Nov. 8, either _ unifocus,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. By all appearances, the man given to gaffes has succeeded in not messing up. A loser in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s first-in-the-nation caucuses, he rallied to bring the primary season to a surprisingly early close. Down by 17 points in the polls in late July, he climbed back up, methodically following a game plan that eventually gave him a wide lead over his rival. He did n't loose his focus, either. Simply put, it was to paint <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as an incorrigible liberal, an inexperienced governor whose leadership could not be trusted. `` Do not gamble on another liberal Democrat coming out of nowhere,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> warned audiences. Emphasizing that Republicans have brought peace and prosperity, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was n't up to dealing with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and he was sure to raise taxes. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> concentrated his time and resources on nine battleground states: <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. In the process, he surprised a lot of people. Once considered weak and awkward on the stump, he instead was tough and aggressive, willing to wage what was widely viewed as a negative campaign. He was n't a wimp. He seemed confident and poised. In televised debates with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> came across as steady and relaxed _ a far cry from the nervous, hyperactive performance he turned in four years earlier in a debate with then <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>. Of course, there were occasional foul-ups. His biggest miscue was saying that Sept. 7 _ instead of Dec. 7 _ was the anniversary of the Japanese attack on <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. Mixing up his words on another occasion, he said, `` I hope I stand for anti-bigotry, anti-Semitism, anti-racism.'' He quickly had aides assure people he was not an anti-Semite. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, scion of the late <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> senator and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> financier <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, was born to a life of privilege in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> amassed a fortune in his own right in the oil fields of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and then followed his father's lead and built up an impressive resume of public service: member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ageny </ORGANIZATION>, vice president Still, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had not won an election in his own right since 1968. He lost _ badly _ in the first event of the 1988 presidential campaign, the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, but then regrouped and came back in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. Then, after losses in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> jumped ahead of the pack and virtually locked up the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination with 16 primary wins on Super Tuesday. Lingering questions about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s role in the Iran-Contra affair threatened to derail his presiential aspirations, as did a perception that he was not his own man. Even his selection of a running mate created controversy, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was forced to defend <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> throughout the fall campaign. In the end, though, it did n't seem to matter. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s aides said the turning point was the Republican convention in August, when there was, in effect, a transfer of leadership and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stepped out of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s shadows. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> played two roles: sweet and sour, good cop and bad cop. He slashed deeply at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. At the same time, he portrayed himself as a family man interested in family values and `` a gentler, kinder nation.'' Like <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s campaign before his, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s was not loaded with bold, new initiatives. He did not veered from the course of the last eight years. `` When you have to change horses in <LOCATION> midstream </LOCATION>, does n't it make sense to switch to the one who's going in the same way?,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked. There were few specifics about how a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would work. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s answer to the huge budget deficit? A `` flexible freeze'' that provided no clues about where he would cut spending. His campaign was loaded with `` feel good'' themes _ balloons, children, sun-drenched wheat fields _ similar to those <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> used. Indeed, his commercials were made by the same team that produced <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s successful `` Morning in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' advertisements in the 1984 presidential race. And if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speeches sometimes sounded like <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s, no wonder. The vice president hired former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speechwriter <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Noonan </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s top wordsmiths, for his own campaign. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s commercials hammered <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as soft on crime, weak on defense and on the wrong side of environmental issues, such as the cleanup of the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> _ echoing themes that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sounded on the campaign trail. Pollster <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said, `` The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> commercials have had an enormous impact. Really more than the debates, more than anything else, they have determined the set of the election up until now.'' <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Wattenberg </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> senior fellow, said, `` They went after <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on all the L-word -LRB- liberal -RRB- stuff, which they had some nice symbols for, prison furloughs and Pledge of Allegiance and <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> and stuff like that.'' Republican political consultant <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Keene </PERSON> said, `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seized on issues of little substance -LRB- such as -RRB- the Pledge of Allegiance, prison furloughs ... that created a caricature <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> could n't escape from. In this way, <PERSON> Keene </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> changed the public perception of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Democrats accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of fanning racial tensions by emphasizing the case of <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, a black man who raped a white woman after escaping from a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prison while on furlough. As governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had defended granting furloughs to murderers. `` There is n't any racism,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also hit <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for being in favor of gun control and abortion. By focusing on the hot-button issues, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hoped to win over the swing voters _ the Democrats who voted for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1980 and 1984 but might go home in 1988. As the race drew to a close, polls showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> significantly ahead of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` Guy asked me yesterday, ` Are you overconfident?' There's no sense of overconfidence. It's more, you know, keep on moving,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I'm going to run like I'm 10 points back all across this country.''

<HEAD>`Silver Spoon' Past, Experience Cloud Quayle Candidacy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s vice presidential campaign has been haunted by his past, doubts about his qualifications and the perception he has led an easy life in which the truly tough problems were solved by mom and dad. Controversy marred his elevation from relative obscurity to the national spotlight as <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate. And it stymied his attempt to show the country he was more than `` just a pretty face.'' The notion that the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator was born with the proverbial silver spoon, never having to struggle for money or power, is borne out by his past. As <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> once told an interviewer, `` Life has been very good to me. I never had to worry about where I was going to go.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, 41, has constantly had to defend himself against charges he is unqualified to be a heartbeat away from the presidency. In response, he touts his chief accomplishments in 12 years in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>: co-authorship of a job training act and detailed work on the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty and other arms-control issues. Before his Oct. 5 debate with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> frequently added another point, saying he has about the same legislative experience that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had when he sought the presidency in 1960. That line was dropped after <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s devastating rebuke: `` Senator, you're no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> denounced as `` side-events'' questions about his military service, academic record and personal life, but his campaign has never completely escaped them. Signs reading `` Chickenhawk,'' `` Who died in your place, <PERSON> Danny </PERSON>?'' and `` Sissy Rich Kid'' confront him from one state to another. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s grandfather was the conservative, self-made publishing magnate, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulliam </PERSON>. In 1955, at the age of 8, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and his family moved from his native <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, where his father, <PERSON> James </PERSON>, ran <PERSON> Pulliam </PERSON> newspapers and joined the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Birch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. The Quayles returned to <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> in 1963 and his father became publisher _ and young <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> eventually became associate publisher _ of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Huntington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald-Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has spent a good part of the campaign of 1988 explaining how he spent the 1960s. Drugs were `` totally unbeknownst to me,'' he said, and while that may seem `` a sheltered life, ... that's a life in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> ... a life in a small town in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>.'' His performance at <ORGANIZATION> DePauw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> was average. Graduating in 1969 during the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> would have been eligible for the draft but instead sought admission to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. He explained to reporters that he did `` what any normal person would do ... call home to mother and father and say, ` I'd like to get in the National Guard.''' One of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' more ardent hawks, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> insists he was n't trying to dodge the draft _ just to be able to attend law school _ and that no undue pressure was applied to get him into the Guard Guard officials said there were openings even in the public relations unit he joined. But a retired major general acknowledged that he asked that a space be held for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> after a retired Guard commander _ a <LOCATION> Pulliam </LOCATION> employee _ called to recommend him. The future politician also had to do some explaining about how he managed to get into <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> when his grades clearly were lacking. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said his son was able to convince the law school that he was qualified on grounds his undergraduate education at the small, private <ORGANIZATION> DePauw </ORGANIZATION> was more intense than might have been available at a public institution. Young <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was accepted into law school after meeting with the admissions dean, a Republican judge in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, where the family owns the local paper. The same judge would later marry <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, who met in law school and wed after a 10-week courtship. After questions were raised this summer about his academic background, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> acknowledged he had never been an exemplary student but refused to release his law school records. He deemed them irrelevant to the campaign and contended `` no rules were broken'' to get him admitted. During the campaign, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was peripherally touched by an old scandal. Former <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lobbyist <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> claimed he had propositioned her on a 1980 golf outing in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> when she was staying in a vacation house with several lawmakers, including <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> angrily denied the accusation and said he had been there only to play golf. His often-stilted delivery and early avoidance of the press contributed to the image of a shaky political newcomer tightly controlled by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> headquarters. His wife was especially protective, pulling his sleeve or abruptly saying, `` Thank you, senator'' to end press encounters. When, two months into the campaign, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> declared his independence from his `` handlers,'' reporters were skeptical. The candidate turned affable and accessible _ but he did n't abandon the mission that the party had laid out for him: to portray Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a liberal out of touch with mainstream <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. While Democrats have preyed on voter doubts about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s qualifications _ polls suggested he was a drag on the ticket _ he did not attempt to dispel the idea he could be president one day In fact, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> says that at one point he talked with his wife about running for president himself this year. `` It was a very casual discussion,'' he added.

<HEAD>Democrats' No. 2 Had to Fight Liberal Label Too</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> knew what it was to run against the `` liberal'' label and tough negative advertising long before he was chosen to be <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate. He is using that experience in a late effort to take the edge off the <ORGANIZATION> Bush-Quayle </ORGANIZATION> campaign. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, a 67-year-old native Texan, was at first shy about directly attacking <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, whom he considered a friend. Now, judging that two months of negative <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> advertising has damaged the Democrats, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has taken off the gloves. In an Oct. 18 speech in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, he made the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ads the central focus of his own campaign, unleashing a blistering attack on the Republicans and their effort to destroy <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' character. `` What happened _ almost without notice _ is an utterly vicious assault of distortion and character assassination'' carried out by Republicans spending `` millions of dollars on television cutting him up,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` They do n't seem to mind if what they say is untrue ... misleading ... downright mean.'' Little of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> fire has been directed at <LOCATION> Bentsen </LOCATION>. Instead, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> have zeroed in on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, taunting him at every turn as a liberal. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, hre a grand jury in <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON>'s church is located, and answered questions about her former pastor. Her lawyer said that the grand jury was investigating matters that included a break-in at her <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> apartment last year and `` the whole <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> thing.'' According to today's indictment, <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON> tried to get Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> to lie to the grand jury about gifts she received from him, including fur coats, casino trips, hotel stays, jewelry, apartment rent and automobile payments. Since the publicity about her involvement with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> has been featured in <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> pictorials and interviews and stayed at the Playboy mansion in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> issued the protection order for Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> at <PERSON> Crusco </PERSON>'s request, despite contentions by <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON>'s lawyer that such an order would add to a `` media circus'' surrounding the case and deprive <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON> of a fair trial Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON> said the order implied that the witness tampering allegations against the minister were true. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> replied there was no such implication and that <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON> would receive a fair trial. <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON>, dressed in a pinstripe suit, lavender shirt, striped tie and ankle-high boots, offered no comment as he was led out of the courtroom and taken to a holding cell in the courthouse. His lawyer refused to discuss the case. `` These charges represent a scheme to cheat the state and all law-abiding taxpayers,'' said state Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>. `` But more importantly, Rev. <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON> allegedly abused the not-for-profit status of a religious organization for his own personal gain.'' In setting $ 25,000 bail, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said he wanted assurances from Gross that the money was n't from church funds. Gross had argued that no bail was needed while <PERSON> Crusco </PERSON> asked for $ 100,000 bail. `` This man has been a minister for over 30 years,'' <PERSON> Gross </PERSON> said. `` He's got a congregation of over 1,000. There is no proof to these charges.'' <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON>, 41, had her case postponed until next month. She is recuperating at home from an infection she contracted after surgery, <PERSON> Gross </PERSON> said. The Profetas each face a maximum of four years in prison on charges of tax evasion and offering a false instrument for filing, the most serious charges against them.

<HEAD>Reagan Seizing Every Opportunity to Put in a Good Word for Bush</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Whether campaigning around the country or hosting an official White House event, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is seizing on every opportunity to plug <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s candidacy and warn Americans against sending a `` liberal'' to the White House. Academics and political experts differ on the extent to which the presidential race between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a referendum on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s nearly 8-year-old presidency. And they disagree about <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s impact on the electorate. But no one questions the 77-year-old president's sincerity in waging a tireless campaign on behalf of his vice president. `` I think he's made the whole <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> learn and remember the experience of 1960,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> governmental studies scholar. `` He's doing for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> what -LRB- Dwight D. -RRB- <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> would n't do for -LRB- Richard M. -RRB- <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>.'' Since Labor Day, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has traveled to 13 states, the bulk of them in the tossup <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, and has raised $ 8.8 million for local and state Republican parties and congressional candidates. He's picked up the tempo in the waning days of the campaign, with a whirlwind tour of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and visits to such border states as <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> Wherever he goes, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> delivers a standard stump speech, telling Americans they'd be risking their future by electing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as his successor. He sprinkles stump speeches with the word `` liberal.'' Most of all, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has reveled in the many appearances he has made at high schools and college campuses, predictably invoking Gen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>'s quote about `` the best blankety-blank kids in the world.'' Standing in a corner of the hardwood floor in the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> fieldhouse on Oct. 21, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> launched a gift basketball in the direction of a basket. While some 12,000 young people roared, he missed, missed again, and then bounced one in off the backboard. His most enthusiastic receptions have come from young people such as those in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, many of whom flashed `` We Love <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>'' and `` Thanks Mr. President'' signs. `` He has an infectious way about him,'' mused <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gable </PERSON>. `` Clearly, they understood him. I have to think the kind of exuberance you saw there will translate into <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as his successor.'' `` I think he loves it,'' said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> political aide <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavin </PERSON>, who said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has appeared at 21 campaign events since Labor Day, including one with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, and has appeared at several events for Republican <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidates. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s top aides have said that the election of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is just one of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s campaign goals. He believes that it must be accompanied by some major <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> strides in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. White House chief of staff <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON>, discussing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s political role before a <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> audience, said the president wants to push <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidacies at the local level `` to encourage fair reapportionment by increasing Republican representation in state legislatures.'' Speaking of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s influence in the campaign, <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> presidential scholar <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> said, `` We ca n't have a controlled experiment because we do n't know what it would be like if he sat on the sidelines. But clearly, there's an awful lot of referendum in this election.'' <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not taken policy stands that are `` measurably different'' from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s, and thus the president has a right `` to claim credit, in fact most of the credit'' if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> beats <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Nov. 8. `` To that degree, he's -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB- an important factor because he's incredibly popular It's phenomenal for a president in his eighth year to have 60 percent approval ratings.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, disagreed. Unimpressed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s foray earlier this month to the blue-collar enclave of <LOCATION> Macomb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, and by the president's appeal to the so-called `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Democrats,'' <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> said, `` I do n't think the visit made much of a difference once way or another.'' `` We saw that in both 1984 and 1986, when he had no coattails here,'' <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> said. But <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> GOP Chairman <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> said he thought <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had been fortunate to be able to take such a high-profile role in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential campaign, noting that <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> in 1968 `` had become a political liability'' and that he likely could not have been used in <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>'s behalf, even if both men had wanted that.

<TEXT>
 Judging by some of the television ads the presidential candidates are running, Americans have a choice this fall between a dangerously naive fringe liberal and an incompetent liar with bad judgment. This year's television drive, with each candidate planning to spend more than $ 30 million, is not only the most expensive but arguably the most negative in the modern history of presidential campaigning. On the sunny side, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is vowing that he's `` on your side'' while Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> swears that he's `` ready on day one to be a great president.'' But Republican <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is also asserting in his ads that `` America ca n't afford'' the risk of a Dukakis presidency. And Democrat <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is belittling not only <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s competence and judgment, but lately his veracity as well. While the 30-second spot reigns supreme as Election Day approaches, particularly in battleground states, the candidates are also purchasing network time for longer appeals to the nation's couch-potato contingent <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> gave two five-minute TV speeches in October and planned two more for Nov. 1 and Nov. 5. He and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> each have bought a half-hour of time on the three major broadcast networks on election eve. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the underdog, also was seeking opportunities for extended television interviews in an attempt to persuade voters to give him another look before making up their minds. In one four-day period he appeared on two network morning news programs, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s talk show on Cable News Network, for 90 minutes on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Nightline,'' and for 14 minutes of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Evening News'' half-hour newscast <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s advertising has taken a double-barreled approach from the start. One set of ads presented the soft-sell: <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the family man with his grandchildren; <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the leader with foreign affairs experience; <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> amid balloons and cheers at the GOP convention insisting he wants `` a kinder and gentler nation.'' `` The vice president spelled out his vision of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and we reinforced it,'' said veteran media consultant <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON>, who heads the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ad team. A second set of ads was used in an attempt _ successful, polls indicate _ to demolish the positive impression many voters had of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> immediately after the Democratic National Convention. One ad charged that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made a $ 6 billion mistake by failing to clean up <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. Another said he gave `` weekend passes to first-degree murderers who were not even eligible for parole,'' opposes the death penalty and vetoed mandatory jail sentences for drug dealers. More-recent spots attacked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' tax and furlough policies as well as his stands on various defense matters. One showed inmates walking in and out a revolving door and said that `` while out, many committed other crimes like kidnapping and rape, and many are still at large.'' Another showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> riding on a tank while a narrator said he opposed `` virtually every defense system we developed.'' The tank ad implied <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opposed a long list of weapons, some of which he is on record as supporting, and provoked an unusually quick response from a campaign widely criticized for failing to defend itself. `` Full of lies, and he knows it,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said of the tank ad in an ad of his own. `` I want to build a strong defense; I'm sure he wants to build a strong defense. So this is n't about defense issues; it's about dragging the truth into the gutter.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also struck back on the furlough front with several radio and television ads, one of them charging that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` has taken a furlough from the truth.'' The spot notes that the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> program was started by a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor and says `` thousands of drug kingpins'' were released under a federal furlough program while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led the war on drugs _ including one ex-inmate who raped and murdered a pregnant mother of two. Along the way <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has also released TV spots attacking <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s record on drugs, education, Social Security and the environment, his role in the Iran-Contra affair and his choice of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as his running mate He has released ads of himself talking simply into the camera about day care, education and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s economic status in the world And he's run a series of `` packaging of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'' ads designed to depict <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as a creature of his handlers. The disjointed nature of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' media campaign has reflected confusion and friction in his advertising ranks as well as the lack of a basic message for his candidacy. But his ads have become feistier and more focused as his poll standings fall, honing in on economic populism and championing middle-class causes. `` There is an overarching theme,'' maintains <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ad chief <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Alessandro </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is on the side of the majority of the people ... His theme is that we must regain our stature and our ability to perform as a country.''

 The morning of Nov. 10, 1938, <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleinmann </PERSON> saw synagogues aflame. By afternoon, the 15-year-old boy and his father had been arrested and beaten by <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. Within months, <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON>, his father and thousands of other Austrian Jews were deported to the <LOCATION> Buchenwald </LOCATION> concentration camp. In April 1945, <PERSON> Kleinmann </PERSON> was freed from the dreaded <LOCATION> Mauthausen </LOCATION>, the third death camp in his ghoulish odyssey through Nazi terror. He weighed just 77 pounds. Today, <PERSON> Kleinmann </PERSON>, 65, a slender, quick-witted man, sits in his apartment in a nondescript tenement bloc in suburban <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and recalls how his terror began on the night now called Kristallnacht: `` In the morning of Nov. 10, we saw two synagogues burning in the Leopoldstadt -LRB- then a largely Jewish district of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> -RRB-. Then we waited for the knock on the door. `` In the afternoon I was arrested. So was my father. After I was maltreated at police headquarters ... I was allowed to go home because I was only 15.'' A day later, police released <PERSON> Kleinmann </PERSON>'s father, who two decades earlier had been seriously wounded and decorated as a soldier in the Austro-Hungarian army. Those World War I decorations did not impress the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> when <PERSON> Kleinmann </PERSON> and many of his family were deported the next year. `` Half of my family were gassed, including one sister and my mother,'' <PERSON> Kleinmann </PERSON> said. Another sister and a younger brother escaped and ended up in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where they still live. `` They burned synagogues and other places of worship. It was terrible ... howling people were standing by,'' screaming anti-Semitic slogans, <PERSON> Kleinman </PERSON> recalled. `` The firefighters arrived all right, but they were under orders not to extinguish the synagogue fires. They protected nearby buildings from catching fire until the Jewish temples were burned out.'' Speaking the broad German dialect of the Viennese working class, <PERSON> Kleimann </PERSON> said the officially endorsed pogrom was a welcome opportunity for many Viennese to vent their anti-Semitism. They looted and stole from Jews, humiliated and mistreated them. `` The terrible thing was that our neighbors, my friends, my father's friends, were among those beating us, vilifying us, spitting at us. Young people who had been my playmates were suddenly <PERSON> Nazis </PERSON> who turned against us,'' he said. Unlike in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, then home to some 200,000 Jews, did not wait for Kristallnacht to start burning and ransacking. Existing Nazi documents and data in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>'s fire department show numerous Jewish temples were devastated in October that year. On Oct. 16, firemen were called to extinguish a fire involving the <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, records show. According to a report on Kristallnacht by Austrian Jews, some 7,800 people were arrested and an unknown number killed in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> alone. The detained were taken to so-called collection camps and brutally treated, while 4,083 <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> shops were plundered, the report found. Some 680 people, many of them Jews, committed suicide on Nov. 10 and subsequent days, said the report by intellectuals, camp survivors and members of the Jewish community Many synagogues, some of them local landmarks, were completely gutted, with mobs throwing hand grenades to set them ablaze. It was only this year that <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> city authorities unveiled plaques to mark remind citizens of the sites where synagogues stood 50 years ago. But <PERSON> Kleinmann </PERSON> and the few who survived the Holocaust never forgot. It took only three weeks after the Nazi Anschluss of March 1938 for <PERSON> Kleinmann </PERSON> to lose his apprenticeship in house decorating, his father's trade. Like tens of thousands of others, he was jobless because he was a Jew. His family was too poor to emigrate and survived on meals from a Jewish relief service. At first, Aryan friends helped <PERSON> Kleinmann </PERSON>'s father survive, slipping him illegal work. Soon, the help turned to scorn and insults. <PERSON> Kleinmann </PERSON>'s two sisters were often picked up by Nazi patrols, mostly former friends, for `` rubbing,'' the practice of forcing Jews to rub walls, pavements and cobblestone roads to remove painted slogans predating the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> annexation. `` I remember that one day I asked a former friend why he was picking up my sister,'' <PERSON> Kleinmann </PERSON> said. `` He said he was ordered to get hold of the girl by a Nazi cell foreman, whom she had once refused to kiss in the doorway.''

<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Underlying <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s recent violent demonstrations is an economic crisis blamed in large measure on the plummeting price of oil. Almost 95 percent of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s export earnings come from petroleum, and the value of these exports has fallen by more than 40 percent since 1981, from $ 14.1 billion to $ 8.4 billion last year. If movements in the dollar's value and world inflation are taken into account, the real purchasing power of these earnings now is barely one-third of what it was eight years ago. The drop in prices was particularly hard on this North African nation because it was in the middle of several huge development projects. The current account balance, which had shown a surplus of more than $ 1 billion in 1985, fell $ 1.48 billion into the red in 1986. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s population is among the fastest growing in the world. Since 1980, the country has grown by 25.6 percent, from 18.7 million people in 1980 to nearly 24 million today. The population has more than doubled since the country won independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1962. About 60 percent of the country is younger than 20, and many of these people took to the streets in October to protest the falling standard of living, rising unemployment, inflation and food shortages _ all related to the sharp drop in oil revenue. More than 150 people were killed, hundreds were injured and an estimated 3,000 people were arrested in nearly a week of demonstrations that rocked the capital and many smaller towns. The riots prompted apparent government reforms. President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON>, who came to power in 1979, announced a Nov. 3 referendum on what reporters describe as `` broad democratization.'' <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> is only the latest victim of violence prompted by falling oil prices. Other countries, including <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, have suffered similar unrest and upheaval. An <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> report published in 1987 noted that the drop in the prices of oil and other raw materials cost Third World countries nearly $ 100 billion in 1986. The loss of revenue came against a backdrop of sharply declining international lending to developing countries. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> is committed to a program of `` trade not aid'' and is seeking to win back revenues by substitute other exports such as uranium. The country has declined rescheduling payments on its $ 20 billion foreign debt. Servicing costs swallow up nearly 60 percent of its export revenue. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> also imports most of its food at a cost of more than $ 1 billion a year.

 The three major networks will project a winner in the presidential race state-by-state as polls close, but refrain from declaring a winner overall until <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> voters cast their ballots _ unless there is a landslide. If one candidate racks up enough electoral votes for victory, based on projections in states where polls have already closed, the networks will not refrain from stating the obvious. `` We're not going to tell the viewer that she has to sit there with a calculator and add it up,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gartner </PERSON>, the new president of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> will pre-empt entertainment programming on Election Night, Nov. 8, and begin coverage with their 7 p.m. EST newscasts. <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>, which as a policy does not project election winners, will run its election coverage from 5 p.m. until 5 a.m. PBS will have updates throughout the evening. The controversy over network projections arose in 1980, when <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> residents reportedly walked off lines at polling places when they heard the networks project <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as the winner over <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. Theoretically, the outcome of close state and local races could have been affected. In fact, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> conceded the election hours before polls closed on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. But the controversy prompted <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to consider legislation setting a national uniform poll-closing time. The heads of the news divisions of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> testified in 1985 in favor of the law and gave its sponsors a handshake agreement that they would not project winners until polls closed. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> reignited the controversy this year when it `` characterized'' the outcome of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary before the polls had closed. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON>, then head of the news division, said the network might not abide by the agreement come November if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did not enact the poll-closing legislation, which it has not done. Under <PERSON> Gartner </PERSON>, who took over the news division this summer, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> has the same policy as the other networks, and all refuse to withhold projections of winners state-by-state. `` A common poll-closing time would solve it because the only other way to do it is to say to a news organization, ` What you know you can not report, what you know as a fact you can not report,' and that's a bad thing,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>' new president said recently. `` ... Assume at 11 o'clock at night I have the whole eastern seaboard as a fact. It is n't a projection. I ca n't withhold it, even if I wanted to.''

<HEAD>Production Stops at Nuclear Weapons Plants amid Firestorm of
Criticism</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Safety problems at aging federal nuclear weapons plants are reaching a critical mass. Production has stopped at major sites, and <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials face a firestorm of criticism from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and angry citizens in the 13 states where the complex operates. `` Tell the truth!'' an irate crowd shouted last week as the manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION>, near <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, argued that the plant's plutonium reprocessing facility was closed because of a single contamination incident. Investigators from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> had found `` very serious'' and repeated safety violations. `` We may sometimes not be good at explaining everything,'' responded the manager, <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Whiteman </PERSON>. `` But we damn well tell the truth.'' Department officials are likely to face a lot more disbelief as they struggle to restart nuclear reactors that produce the plutonium and tritium needed for the nation's nuclear arsenal. Neither is being produced now and tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, may be in critically short supply as early as next summer, according to congressional sources. Federal officials also are likely to face rising anger as they grapple with the daunting task of cleaning up 45 years' worth of radioactive contamination, a job the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says could cost $ 110 billion. If the Manahattan Project, which produced atomic bombs at the end of World War II, was an example of what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can do when it focuses its technological genius, then the current mess in nuclear weapons production may epitomize what can happen when such activities are shrouded for decades in secrecy and bureaucracy. `` This crisis has not arisen suddenly but over a long period, and it stems from inadequate attention to maintenance, safety and operating conditions,'' 31 members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said in a letter Thursday to <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, in a report requested by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, described the complex last year as `` a loose-knit system of largely self-regulated contractors'' under little control of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The complex, comprising many potentially dangerous elements, operated under a regime dictated not by safety concerns but by the need to produce nuclear weapons for the arms race, the academy said. Not only were the reactors and other facilities older than those in the civilian sector, the report said, but they were free of the strict controls imposed by the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on utilities after the near-disaster at Three Mile Island on March 28, 1979. The Energy Department is the latest in a line of civilian agencies that have built and managed the plants that turn out an estimated 1,800 nuclear weapons a year for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> under a $ 7.8 billion budget. The complex, which now employs about 90,000 people in 13 states _ at three laboratories, two test sites, two reactor complexes and 13 other sites _ was born in 1943 in the desert at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Project scientists labored in remote secrecy. Two other weapons laboratories were added, at <LOCATION> Livermore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Sandia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, and the government began operating two reactor complexes, the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, near <LOCATION> Richland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, in 1944, and the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, a decade later. Other materials are produced at the Feed Materials Production Center, in <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Ashtabula </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ashtubula </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; the Y-12 plant and <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gaseous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diffusion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Paducah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gaseous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diffusion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Paducah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>; and the <ORGANIZATION> Portsmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gaseous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diffusion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Piketon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. At the next step, the Rocky Flats Plant near <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> processes plutonium and assembles primary devices; the Y-12 plant manufactures second-stage components; the Mound Facility in <LOCATION> Miamisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, makes detonators and firing circuit components; the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, makes non-nuclear parts; and the <ORGANIZATION> Pinellas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, makes neutron generators, according to `` The Nuclear Weapons Databook,'' written by <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. All the components are shipped to the <ORGANIZATION> Pantex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION>, near <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, assembled into warheads and given to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> NRDC </ORGANIZATION>, a private environmental group in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Nuclear devices are tested underground at two sites in <LOCATION> Nye </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Test Range and the Tonopah Test Range. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has ordered that the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> review all the sites and produce a report by mid-December on which to modernize and which, if any, to close, said department spokesman <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Callicott </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> plans do not call for the construction of a new generation of nuclear weapons reactors until well into the next decade, a $ 3.2 billion facility at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and a $ 3.6 billion facility in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. Budget austerity could cause further delays or cancellation of one site. The public and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> began to complain of serious problems in the nuclear weapons production complex years ago. Although most attention has focused on problems at <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fernald </PERSON> and Rocky Flats, an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report issued in June cited problems at nearly every facility and said remedying them would cost $ 66 billion to $ 110 billion. The biggest expense will be at the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reservation </LOCATION>, where all nine reactors have been closed down. In January 1987, engineers placed the last of them, the N-Reactor, in `` cold standby,'' 25 years after it entered operation. The Energy Department, in 19,000 pages of documents released in February 1986, detailed significant spills of radioactive material over 43 years, particularly during the Cold War years, when secrecy was the by-word and the health hazards of radiation were not as well understood as they are today. The cost of upgrading and decontaminating the Hanford Reservation was forecast by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> at $ 2.4 billion through 1995, with further corrective actions forecast as high as $ 46 billion over 50 years. Department officials have estimated that it could take 18 months to restart N-reactor, if it were needed. The other reactor complex, <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, faces problems that are almost as serious. All three reactors there have been shut down, none will be allowed to run at above 50 percent power in the future, and a select team of engineers is trying to design new safety procedures for a month-long `` phased start-up'' of one reactor, starting no earlier than December. The cost of correcting problems at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and cleaning up contamination is expected to run to $ 3.6 billion through 1985 and as high as $ 8.8 billion thereafter.

 Another alarming situation exists at <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>, about 20 miles from <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. Workers struck the plant nearly a month ago, interrupting production. The state of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, on behalf of the 14,000 people living near the plant, has filed a $ 300 million lawsuit against the federal contractor there, National Lead, based on admissions by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in January 1985 that the facility spewed at least 200,000 pounds of radioactive uranium oxide dust into the air. The department also said the plant leaked radioactive waste into the ground, possibly endangering the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> aquifer, which supplies water for communities throughout southwestern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> earlier this month demanded that the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> close down the plant, but thought better of the idea last Monday and asked the feds to stick around to clean up the mess. `` I shudder to think what would happen if the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> washed its hands of this facility,'' said <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON>. `` We know that a clean-up can be accomplished, and the people best to do it are the people who work here.'' The cleanup and corrective costs at <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION> have been estimated by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> at $ 1.1 billion through 1995 and $ 1.2 billion thereafter. Lesser problems have been reported at two nearby plants, in <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION>, and the department envisioned no clean-up costs for the remaining <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> plant, at <LOCATION> Ashtabula </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, problems at the Rocky Flats Plant are snowballing. Building 771, where plutonium is reprocessed, was closed down after two workers suffered low-grade contamination Sept. 29. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Echart </PERSON>, a spokesman for contractor <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, said the 6,000 employees at the plant have continued working at other buildings on the site. Among their jobs _ processing plutonium for nuclear triggers. Last August, it was disclosed that <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials had considered shutting down <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> because of repeated safety violations and `` lax attitudes,'' charges that were repeated in a congressional study released earlier this month. Safety complaints at the plant jumped six-fold from 1982 to 1987, officials of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 8031 </ORGANIZATION> announced in March 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, reported last June that 103 waste-disposal sites needed to be cleaned up. The Energy Department has estimated the cost of cleanup and correction there at $ 576 million to $ 900 million through 1995, plus $ 185 million subsequently. At other facilities: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Pinellas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> grabbed national headlines in 1983 when the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> reported that its security system failed in a series of mock attacks Security has been tightened there, but investigators have reported that radioactive and toxic wastes from the 100-acre site had seeped into <LOCATION> Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ciega </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, a popular residential and recreational area. The cost of cleaning and correcting the seepage, and coping with other waste problems is forecast to cost $ 42.4 million through 1995, and up to $ 9 million thereafter. _ Environmental improvement at the Oak Ridge site in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> is expected to cost $ 1.3 billion through 1995, with much of the money going to locating buried nuclear waste and cleaning up sediment ponds Four research reactors at <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> have been closed down. _ Early atomic weapons tests at the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> test site were conducted above ground Residents of nearby southern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> contend the tests caused increased incidences of cancer in their communities and among veterans who watched the explosions. Tests are conducted below-ground now, although there have been reports of venting, in which radioactive material escaped to the surface. Environmental costs at the test sites are estimated at $ 634 million through 1995, and up to $ 750 million thereafter.

 Videos reviewed this week: `` Beetlejuice,'' `` Bright Lights, <LOCATION> Big </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' `` Jean de Florette'' and `` Manon of the Spring.'' `` Beetlejuice'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>; VHS-Beta, $ 89.95; Rated PG -RRB- If a newly-deceased yuppie couple finds their <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> Ashley-esque <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> home occupied by a new family with decorating taste so bad it could awaken the dead, who ya gon na call? `` Beetlejuice!'' And not a bad call at that, with a hilarious <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON> starring in the title role of this wacky film which pokes fun at life and death in the 1980s, and leaves you puzzled whether there's any important difference between those two states `` Beetlejuice'' opens with <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Maitland </PERSON> perishing when they drive their standard-issue yuppie <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> stationwagon off a wooden bridge. Upon dying, the first thing they learn is that the crucial difference between life and death is that ghosts seem to assume pastel tones and dress more flamboyantly. They then learn that they are to spend the next 125 years haunting the home they so lovingly decorated. That sounds OK at first. But that fate turns hellish when an upscale <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> couple named <PERSON> Deetz </PERSON> and their death-obsessed daughter move in and threaten the decor with the most tacky taste imaginable. The rest of the film describes how the Maitlands, played in low-key fashion by <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Geena </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, fail miserably in their efforts to scare the <ORGANIZATION> Deetzes </ORGANIZATION> out, and finally enlist the help of the oversexed, supersleezy poltergeist Beetlejuice. For all its zaniness, the film is n't as funny as the plot suggests, especially in the long, dry spells when <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON> is n't on screen. But see `` Beetlejuice'' for three reasons: <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON> -LRB- of SCTV fame -RRB-, who plays Mrs. <PERSON> Deetz </PERSON> to tacky perfection, film great <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> who has a terrific cameo as the <PERSON> Maitland </PERSON>'s guidance counselor from `` the other side'' and above all, <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON>. `` Beetlejuice'' is rated PG, for mildly racy language. _ By <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitgang </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Bright Lights, <LOCATION> Big </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> Home Video; VHS-Beta, $ 89.95; Rated R -RRB- Poor <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Conway </PERSON>. His mother died, his gorgeous model wife left him, he ca n't seem to get his fiction writing moving and he's obviously about to lose his job as a fact-checker for a prestigious magazine To soothe his pain, <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> -RRB- dives into a huge vat of self-pity and into the cocaine haze of the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> nights in `` Bright Lights, <LOCATION> Big </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.'' While there are some great details in the movie version of <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> McInerney </PERSON>'s hit novel, `` Bright Lights'' is not very engaging on screen. The book entertains mostly through a running narrative which falls short in <LOCATION> James </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridges </LOCATION>' movie, for which <PERSON> McInerney </PERSON> also gets screenwriting credit. Among the winning moments are those on the subway; in a nightclub where the bartender is a pretty, bald woman and the bathrooms are co-ed drug dens; and a tender, loving conversation between <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> and his mother -LRB- <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiest </PERSON> -RRB-. The actors perform well, including <PERSON> Wiest </PERSON>, who makes you feel her pain as she dies of cancer; <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Robards </PERSON> as an alcoholic has-been editor; <PERSON> Swoozie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON> as a co-worker who never gives up on <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Keifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> as <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON>'s crass best pal. The talented cast also includes <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Sternhagen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Phoebe </PERSON> <PERSON> Cates </PERSON>, who has precious little to do but look precious as <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON>'s model-wife. _ By <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> MacVean </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Jean de Florette'' and `` Manon of the Spring'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>; VHS-Beta, $ 89.98; Rated PG; in French, subtitled -RRB- The <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> films `` Jean de Florette'' and `` Manon of the Spring'' are halves of a movie in which a good man is undone by jealous enemies and is avenged by his daughter in the haunted light and flinty hills of <LOCATION> Provence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Set in the 1920s, `` Jean de Florette'' concerns the young farmer, Ugolin -LRB- <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Auteuil </PERSON> -RRB-, who wants to grow carnations and covets a plot of land with a secret spring. With his scheming uncle, Papet -LRB- <PERSON> Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> Montand </PERSON> -RRB-, he caps the spring to buy the land at a bargain price. He is thwarted by <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Depardieu </PERSON> -RRB-, a hunchback with Romantic ideals, who inherits the farm and returns to nature with his wife, <PERSON> Aimee </PERSON>, and young daughter, <PERSON> Manon </PERSON>. Ugolin and <PERSON> Papet </PERSON> turn the townspeople against <PERSON> Jean </PERSON>, who remains ignorant of the spring. His attempts to farm end in disaster. Only <PERSON> Manon </PERSON> in the last scene learns of the treachery. It is 10 years later in `` Manon of the Spring,'' and <PERSON> Manon </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Emanuelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Beart </PERSON> -RRB- is a wild young shepherdess in the hills who avenges her father. By the final scene all the raveled threads of the plot are rewoven. <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Brach </PERSON>'s adaptation of <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Pangnol </PERSON>'s `` L'eau des Colines'' evokes the pessimism of Guy de Maupassant in its twisted plot. The movie's beauty and atmosphere survive translation to the small screen. So do the sloppy subtitles. <PERSON> Montand </PERSON> and <PERSON> Depardieu </PERSON> -LRB- `` The Return of <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guerre </ORGANIZATION>'' and `` <PERSON> Danton </PERSON>'' -RRB- are both excellent, <PERSON> Auteuil </PERSON> superb. And yet, with all these nice things happening, the thematic richness of water and secret springs, soil and seasons, these two half-movies never quite fuse. Ultimately they do n't run nearly as deep as the spring. _ By <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy expanded at a modest 2.2 percent annual rate during the summer, the slowest pace in almost two years, as the drought and a worsening trade deficit slowed economic activity.

 News that the economy expanded during the summer at the slowest pace in nearly two years has driven the dollar to its lowest point since late June. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday taht the gross national product, the broadest measure of the economy, grew at a modest 2.2 percent annual rate in the third quarter. Financial market forecasts widely expected a 3 percent to 3.5 percent rise. Slower growth reduces the chance that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will raise interest rates to cool off inflation, and lower <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rates would reduce demand for dollars. The dollar was quoted in late <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading at 125.71 Japanese yen, down from 126.80 yen late Tuesday. By contrast, the bond market, which usually rallies at signs of slower growth, rose only modestly. The yield on the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s closely watched 30-year bond slipped to 8.90 percent from 8.93 percent late Tuesday In other economic developments Wednesday: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that family earnings increased a median $ 23 a week or 4 percent _ slightly less than the consumer price inflation rate of 4.2 percent _ in the past 12 months _ The <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> said nearly $ 19 billion changes hands in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> yearly as family members help one another such as children aiding aging parents or mom and dad helping offspring start a household _ The government said first-year base wage increases _ excluding cost-of-living adjustments _ averaged 3.3 percent in major union contracts negotiated in the first nine months of this year The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, hoping a buoyant economy will propel <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> into the White House, played down the significance of the new GNP report, blaming much of the sluggishness on temporary factors such as the drought. Commerce Undersecretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortner </PERSON> predicted economic growth would pick up again in the final three months of the year, reflecting further improvement on the trade front and continued consumer and business spending. Private economists generally agreed with that assessment, saying the slowdown was a welcome development because it should help to ease inflationary pressures that had been building because of tight labor markets and high factory operating rates. A price index tied to the GNP indicated inflation moderated in the third quarter. The index, which reflects changing consumption patterns, rose at an annual rate of 4.4 percent, down from a 5.5 percent rate of increase from April through June. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has been forecasting the overall economy would expand at a 3.5 percent annual rate in 1988, giving the country the best performance since 1984, also a presidential election year. GNP grew 3.4 percent last year.

 In the absence of any market-moving developments, crude oil futures prices have been mixed in dull, quiet trading. `` The market is just waiting for the next rumor to come out of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, an energy analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

Other contract months also were higher. Among refined products, unleaded gasoline closed at 51.67 cents a gallon, down 0.27 cent. The contract had risen 1.98 cents on Tuesday.

 The man who soon will take the helm of beleaguered brokerage <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> says the firm can succeed in the hotly competitive investment business by serving specific markets instead of the masses. `` <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> is a really sound organization. It has been around for 114 years,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarb </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` There is room in this business for a high-quality firm that is in selected areas and is not trying to be all things to all people.'' <PERSON> Zarb </PERSON>, 53, a prominent Wall Street figure who served as energy czar under President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, will be working for old-time acquaintance <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weill </PERSON> effective Nov. 1, as chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Weill </PERSON> is chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which is acquiring <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>'s parent <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Weill </PERSON>, 55, will be chairman, president and chief executive officer of the merged company, while <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION>, will be a director and chairman of the executive committee <PERSON> Weill </PERSON> created the brokerage firm that now is <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Zarb </PERSON> worked in various capacities at its predecessor firms. In addition to serving as President <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>'s chief energy administrator, <PERSON> Zarb </PERSON> currently is an adviser to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and several foreign governments. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> <PERSON> Barney </PERSON>, a mid-size investment bank specializing in retail brokerage and municipal finance, disbanded its arbitrage department _ which essentially speculated on takeover stocks _ after losing $ 43 million in last year's stock market crash. <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION> posted a $ 15 million profit in the first quarter of this year and a $ 3 million loss in the second quarter. Analysts say <PERSON> Zarb </PERSON> has his work cut out for him. Greenwich-based <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> acquired <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION> last year for $ 750 million, loading itself up with new debt just months before the stock market crash, and subsequent slowdown in the securities business. The success of <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION> is regarded as a swing factor for the profit of the entire corporation. `` The key to success there is to control the operating expenses and try to generate additional revenues from high margin businesses,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hochstim </PERSON>, equity analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hochstim </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION> needs a strong merger and acqusitions department to boost its earnings. `` That's not something that is easily built overnight,'' he said in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> office. `` They have a good retail sales force, a good equity research department, but they are not a real force in M & amp; A -LRB- mergers and acqusitions -RRB- or investment banking and that's where the money is being made. But he also said the announcement of the merger between <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> already had benefited <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>. `` One of the key points is that since the announced merger, morale at <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION> has improved dramatically and that's worth a lot,'' he said. `` You no longer have people worrying about their jobs and future. They're back to work.'' Other analysts say <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION> needs to be a full-service firm _ right now, it does n't offer a full line of financial products _ but <PERSON> Zarb </PERSON> disagrees. `` Full service implies a large warehouse that does everything for everyone, whether they do it well or not,'' <PERSON> Zarb </PERSON> said. `` That's not what we're going to do. `` I want to build on what has been a very old and fine reputation and built it into a firm in the 1990s that will be an important participant in the upper ends of the marketplace,'' he said. <PERSON> Weill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> say <PERSON> Zarb </PERSON>'s record and leadership qualities are what <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION> needs. `` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> has two characteristics that I think are key,'' <PERSON> Weill </PERSON> said in an interview earlier this week. `` Number one, he is a leader and I think a leader is a person who knows how to listen and get the most out of people and move something from point a to point b. `` Number two, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> is a winner. He started in <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s back office ... and take that through his success in government. He was assistant secretary of labor and left as energy czar on the President's <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Weill </PERSON> said. `` I'm convinced he will bring in new talent and motivate the current management team,'' <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> said in an interview Wednesday. `` It's a difficult market and if everybody is having a tough time and you have a new breath of fresh air ... I think he will do a lot.''

<HEAD>Roderick: Takeover Frenzy Hindering Manufacturing Competitiveness</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Corporate takeovers financed with debt produce short-term profits on Wall Street but handicap <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers as they battle foreign competitors, the chairman of steelmaker <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says. `` It's absolutely critical that we strengthen our manufacturing sector,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said Wednesday. In leveraged buyouts, where the target's assets and future earnings are often pledged as collateral for loans, `` you load those companies with debt,'' the head of the steel and oil company said. `` That means ... you have to cut all spending in order to service the debt. You cut the research. You cut the capital spending,'' he said at <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> management's quarterly news conference. `` Is it desirable in a competitive world, where we are fighting for our manufacturing lives? The answer is no. It's going to make us progressively less competitive in those sectors that are being taken over with the use of debt.'' Even in light of the recent takeover frenzy, involving multibillion dollar battles for such huge manufacturers as <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> does not favor regulating corporate takeovers, even though he believes they reflect shortsightedness. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> itself could be a takeover target. <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said the stock market has undervalued the company's stock, which closed at $ 28 a share, down 50 cents on Wednesday in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. Takeover strategist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, who has held an 11.4 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> since 1986, seems content with his investment and has not renewed his threat to make an offer for the company, <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> chairman, who dines occasionally with <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s apparent reluctance to make a run at the company is not the result of any personal courtesy to <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON>, who will retire next spring `` I would assume that Mr. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> will ultimately do what he thinks is good for Mr. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said. `` I remember <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> told me at one point ... if you want a friend on Wall Street, you buy a dog.'' The shift in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy from manufacturing to service industries should not be allowed to go too far, <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said. `` You ca n't ... have manufacturing disappear. How do you defend the country and lead the world in free-world defense by knowing how to make hamburgers?'' he said. `` Ninety-two percent of the non-medical research done in this country is done by manufacturing,'' <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said. `` You do n't have to research a lot if you're talking about travelers checks or barbers.''

<HEAD>Fate of Two Copper Mines to be Decided Next Week</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pending sales of two government-owned copper mines could bring debt-ridden <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> $ 2 billion, a government spokesman says. The winning bidders for Mexicana de Cobre and <ORGANIZATION> Compania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cananea </ORGANIZATION> will be announced next Tuesday, the government said Wednesday. Bidding on the two mines in northern <LOCATION> Sonora </LOCATION> state closed today. The announcement ended speculation that the government had changed its mind on the controversial sale. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> <PERSON> Contente </PERSON>, of the government development bank <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financiera </ORGANIZATION>, said he expects Mexicana de Cobre will be sold for at least $ 1.1 billion while not less than $ 910 million will be accepted for <ORGANIZATION> Compania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cananea </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s most historic mine. The two companies have debts totaling about $ 2 billion, <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> <PERSON> Contente </PERSON> said, but are considered good investments mainly because of the price of copper is rising in world markets. Under a plan to reduce government subsidies and help <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> overcome its economic crisis, President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> has sold many government-owned companies, most of them money losers, to private investors. Most of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s $ 104 billion foreign debt is owed by the government. <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> <PERSON> Contente </PERSON> said the mine sales would be the crowning achievement in de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s re-privatization plan. `` Either one of those is the biggest sale by any government in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in history,'' <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> <PERSON> Contente </PERSON> said by telephone Wednesday from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` They signify an important part of de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s pledge to reduce the size of the public sector,'' said <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> <PERSON> Contente </PERSON>, coordinator of the mine sales for <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financiera </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> Nafinsa </ORGANIZATION>. But the sale has met opposition in <LOCATION> Cananea </LOCATION>, 25 miles south of the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> border, where the `` martyrs of 1906'' have not been forgotten. A bloody strike at what was then the American-owned <ORGANIZATION> Cananea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Copper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> 82 years ago has come to symbolize the birth of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s nationalistic spirit and union movement. At least 11 men died in the strike, launched by Mexican miners who got paid less than American workers at the mine. <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quijano </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>, general secretary of the powerful <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Section </ORGANIZATION> 65 that represents the 3,000 unionized workers at <LOCATION> Cananea </LOCATION>, said in a recent interview that the union would oppose the sale. `` They can sell a company, but they ca n't sell workers,'' <PERSON> Quijano </PERSON> said in a telephone interview last month. `` We hope they do n't find someone to sell it to.'' Calls to <PERSON> Quijano </PERSON>'s office at the mine did not go through Wednesday. <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> <PERSON> Contente </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Nafinsa </ORGANIZATION> has had `` no problem with the union. It knows the federal government's policy.'' Two companies have bid on Cananea, Penoles and <ORGANIZATION> Protexa </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in this northern <LOCATION> Nuevo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leon </LOCATION> state capital. <ORGANIZATION> Protexa </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 910 million finanincing package was rejected this summer by <ORGANIZATION> Nafinsa </ORGANIZATION>, which led to speculation that the mine would not be sold during the current administration that ends Dec. 1. <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> <PERSON> Contente </PERSON> said four companies have put deposits of nearly $ 11,000 for the right to bid Thursday on Mexicana de Cobre.

<HEAD>Dollar Plunges Over Slow U.S. Growth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar dropped sharply today in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, apparently reflecting disappointment over the slow growth of the American economy, while share prices rose on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar's decline followed the release of the latest gross national product figure, showed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy grew at an annual rate of 2.2 percent during the third quarter of the year compared to 3 percent and 3.4 percent growth in the first two quarters. The dollar closed at 125.90 yen, down 0.90 yen from Wednesday's close of 126.80 yen The currency opened sharply lower at 125.95 yen and declined further, ranging between 125.80 yen and 126.15 yen. To keep the dollar from declining further, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> intervened and bought dollars shortly after the market opened, according to <PERSON> Takamasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamasaki </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>'s governor <PERSON> Satoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON> declined comment on the bank's intervention. The central bank of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> rarely comments on its actions. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, share prices gained 102.31 points, or 0.37 percent, to finish at 27,722.92. The index gained 106.00 points shortly after the market opened and kept most of that. On Wednesday, it closed at 27,620.60 points. The lower-than-expected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> GNP figure helped end investors' concerns over inflation and spurred their buying interest today, said an analyst with a major securities firm in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Trading was hectic with volume on the first section estimated at 2 billion shares. Among the issues attracting investors were steels and shipbuilding.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar was mixed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> today after falling to four-month lows on a report of unexpectedly low <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic growth. Gold also was mixed. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency fluctuated in a narrow range in moderately active trading. Dealers in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> reported modest intervention by the West German and Japanese central bank in support of the dollar. The banks, as is their custom, declined to comment. Dealers said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic performance was keeping the dollar low, but market fears of central bank intervention were preventing it falling further. `` The dollar is falling and it has to fall. The only question mark is the central bank intervention policy,'' said an Italian trader. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.90 yen to a closing 125.90 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it slipped back even further to 125.70 yen. It was the lowest dollar-yen rate recorded in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> since June 17, when the dollar closed at 125.73 yen. The dollar's latest decline was triggered by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gross national product figures which showed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy grew at an annual rate of 2.2 percent during the third quarter of the year compared with 3 percent and 3.4 percent growth in the first two quarters. Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.7750 West German marks, up from 1.7745; 1.4975 Swiss francs, down from 1.5065; 6.0635 French francs, down from 6.0725; 2.0035 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0005; 1,322.00 Italian lire, down from 1,323.50; and 1.1990 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1988 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound fell to $ 1.7580, compared with $ 1.7600 Wednesday. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 408.10 a troy ounce, up from $ 407.05 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning today, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 407.15 In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 406.95, down from $ 407.10 bid late Wednesday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell 54 cents to close at a bid $ 409.22. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> today at a bid price of $ 6.22 a troy ounce, up from Wednesday's $ 6.21.

 The management of <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, who failed in their own bid to buy the company, have approved the sale of the retail and manufacturing conglomerate to two <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment groups for $ 2.7 billion The agreement by <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Wasserstein </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Perella </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> to buy <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> followed by 12 days the termination of the management-led effort to put the company under private ownership. <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION>' announcement Wednesday suggested the agreement would result in the departure of chairman <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigoloff </PERSON>, who brought the company out of bankruptcy in 1985 and organized the failed management buyout. The agreement calls for <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Wasserstein </PERSON> <PERSON> Perella </PERSON> to pay $ 11.25 a share in cash for 80 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION>' 49.8 million shares. The remaining stock would be converted to preferred stock in <ORGANIZATION> WCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the company formed to handle the purchase.

<HEAD>Great Western Fed Up With Federal Thrift Regulators; Wants Out</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's third largest savings and loan, says it wants to leave the troubled federal system that bails out failed thrifts and to join the insurance system for commercial banks The move would save Great Western at least $ 27 million a year in insurance premiums and send a message to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that the nation's healthy thrifts are fed up with paying to rescue faltering, often badly managed S & amp; Ls, analysts said `` This is a very important statement,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Treadway </PERSON>, an analyst for the investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` This is a signal that Great Western is not going to put up with any more nonsense and have its net worth stolen without a fight.'' Great Western said Wednesday it has applied for permission to drop <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> coverage of deposits in its 263 retail branches in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> in favor of insurance by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which covers most banks and some thrifts. At least one other big <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> thrift, <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, was considering pulling out of the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>, but was prevented from doing so immediately by its charter. Most savings institutions are barred by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from leaving the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>, although <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> says it is exempt from that rule. Great Western's action appeared unlikely to mark the beginning of a mass exodus from the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>, which faces $ 50 billion to $ 100 billion in bailout costs. But the move was seen to have great symbolic significance as members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are expected this session to put a high priority on the issue of thrift bailouts. `` This is sure to get the attention of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Coulson </PERSON>, chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Glendale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has got to address this problem sooner or later. They ca n't continue tapping the healthy thrifts forever.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, chairman of parent <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said the application was made to protect the firm's stockholders from special insurance levies The insurance switch, if approved, would n't affect customers or employees, but would save the parent company and its stockholders about $ 26 million a year in special <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> premiums, said spokesman <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>. Great Western is among about 40 of the nation's 3,200 <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls that filed documents making them eligible for exemptions from the ban on defections from the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> that was imposed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in August 1987 and renewed Aug. 10. About 10 S & amp; L's, none of them as large as Great Western, have left the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> to be insured by the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> while retaining their savings and loan charters. What irks healthy thrifts are the high <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> premiums they are charged to offset the losses of a minority troubled thrifts. Those premiums run about 2 -LCB- times more than those assessed by the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>. Both the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> insure customers accounts up to $ 100,000. But while the thirft insurer is insolvent, the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> expects to have at least $ 15 billion in reserves by the end of the year. Great Western Financial, based in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, is the nation's No 3 thrift holding company with $ 31 billion in assets and 900 offices nationwide. It focuses its business in industry's traditional area of home mortgages, as opposed to aggressive and sometimes shaky thrifts that have made commercial loans Great Western said it would accomplish the insurance switch by merging its <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> retail operations into a small thrift subsidiary in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state that already has <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> insurance. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, defections from the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> are hampered by state thrift laws, which do n't allow state-chartered S & amp; Ls to carry <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> insurance.

<HEAD>West Point Puts Severance Plan In Place To Protect Employees In
Takeover</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Textile giant <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, facing a takeover fight with <ORGANIZATION> Farley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, has created a financial cushion for more than 14 percent of its employees who might find themselves without a job under a new owner. However, <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday, the severance pay package has nothing to do with the $ 1.4 billion tender offer announced Monday by <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, one of the nation's largest privately held conglomerates. <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Roark </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s vice president of human resources, said the severance plan was adopted by the board last week. `` This is not something we did in response to <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Roark </PERSON> said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> heads the conglomerate which owns underwear manufacturer Fruit of the Loom and other companies. `` We had been talking -LRB- about the plan -RRB- in the management group for several months,'' <PERSON> Roark </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from the company's <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, headquarters. `` This was not, and we do n't now consider it, ` shark repellent,''' he said, referring to jargon used to describe tactics companies use to fend off corporate raiders. A <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> spokesman said the company would have no comment on the provision. <PERSON> Roark </PERSON> said the plan _ which guarantees at least three months pay to some 5,900 salaried and clerical employees _ would not involve enough money to dissuade a suitor. However, he had no estimate on the amount of money involved, saying it would depend on how many employees were involved and their level of seniority. The decision fits in with a series of moves <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> has taken this year to strengthen its ability to fight a takeover. In June, the company adopted a shareholder rights plan which would allow the board to issue a special class of stock as a dividend to current stockholders. The `` poison pill'' plan would take effect as soon as a tender offer is launched or if someone purchases 10 percent of <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> stock. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> notified the company in May it was seeking up to 25 percent of <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> stock and so far has spent $ 88 million for 9.8 percent of the stock. The company is also one of the first to adopt <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s new anti-takeover law, enacted by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> principally at the urging of textile industry lobbyists. The main provision of the law, which took effect in March, limits a new owner's ability to sell off parts of a company for five years. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> also has had in place for some time so-called `` golden parachutes'' for executives, including a $ 1.39 million payout to Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> if he were to be fired by new owners. The new state law, and the `` poison pill'' plan have been challenged by <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> in federal court and a <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> stockholder, who filed a suit in state <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday, claiming stockholders are deprived of the highest possible stock price. The severance plan covers all salaried and certain skilled clerical workers. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> is the nation's largest publicly held textile and apparel company. Earlier this year, the company and the investment group <ORGANIZATION> Odyssey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> jointly acquired <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stevens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>.

In a statement, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> said that in addition to the high costs of incentives, which the company used extensively to lure buyers into showrooms, and the closing for the entire period of the <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, assembly plant, the company had a heavier proportion of fleet sales over more profitable individual car sales. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was expected to announce its third-quarter results today, a day after No. 2 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> posted a 21.8 percent rise in its third-quarter earnings _ its 10th straight report of record quarterly profits. For the first nine months of this year, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings fell 34.4 percent to $ 616.6 million, or $ 2.77 a share, from $ 939.5 million, or $ 4.33 a share, last year. Sales for the first nine months of 1988 amounted to $ 23.17 billion, compared with $ 18.61 billion in 1987, a 24.5 percent increase. Also today, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported record third-quarter earnings of $ 59 million, 20 percent more than the $ 49 million it earned during the third quarter of last year. For the first nine months of 1988, the financial arm of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 185 million, a nine-month record and up 12 percent from the $ 166 million it earned during the January-September period last year. On Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 856.3 million, or $ 1.78 per share, on sales of $ 17.73 billion during the July-September period this year. That compares with earnings of $ 703.2 million, or $ 1.38 a share, on sales of $ 15.25 billion during the same period last year. For the first nine months of the year, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 4.1 billion, or $ 8.53 a share, on sales of $ 60.9 billion, up 12.2 percent from earnings of $ 3.7 billion, or $ 7.17 a share on sales of $ 52.9 billion during the January-September period last year. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McCammon </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for finance and treasurer, said the company continued to do well overseas, especially in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` We do have a declining -LRB- profit -RRB- margin in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and that's been the case all year,'' he said. `` The overseas margin has been increasing because of outstanding results this year in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and also <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has come back substantially.'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 384 million from its overseas operations in the third quarter of 1988, up 249 percent from the $ 110 million earned overseas during the period last year. The company earned $ 472 million from its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operations, down 20.4 percent from the $ 593 million it earned in the July-September period last year. Because of the depressed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> results, profit sharing for unionized workers will be down this year compared with last, <PERSON> McCammon </PERSON> said. Although he was n't specific about just how much a worker would receive, he said it would fall somewhere between the $ 3,700 average per worker in 1987 and the $ 2,100 average the year before. <PERSON> McCammon </PERSON> blamed much of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decline on development of new products, lower earnings by the company's <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and higher production of lower-profit cars. He said that during the quarter, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> produced 30 percent fewer of its high-profit Thunderbirds than it did last year, and made more lower-profit Ford Tempos and Mercury Topazes.

 <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> took its $ 20.3 billion takeover offer directly to <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s stockholders today, after managers of the consumer products giant ended talks with the investment firm. <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON>'s management said it would continue to work with its investment adviser, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, on its own buyout proposal. In an advertisement appearing in the Wall Street Journal, <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> said its offer was conditioned on <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON>'s board supporting the bid. But corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was watching the fight closely to see how far the firm would go to protect its position as the nation's premier leveraged buyout firm. Since its founding in 1976, <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> has not acquired a company without the support of the target's board, although the firm gradually has become more aggressive in its deal making. <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> had announced Monday that it might begin the $ 90-a-share tender offer. That was just four days after <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON> said its top managers were considering trying to buy the company for $ 75 a share, which would be worth $ 17 billion. <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON> stock edged up 12 -LCB- cents a share to $ 84.87 -LCB- in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The sheer size of <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION>'s bid for <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON> has forced corporations to reassess their own vulnerability. `` There's been a gradual awakening over the past week that if deals above $ 10 billion are successful, it gives credibility to even larger deals, and it's getting down to almost a handful of companies that are secure'' based on sheer size alone, said one top takeover lawyer, who spoke on condition of anonymity. According to one takeover specialist, who spoke on condition he not be identified, <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> is `` attempting to keep bidding on bigger and bigger deals so other people in leveraged buyout business ca n't compete with them. They'd like to be thought of as ... the only ones that come to mind when it's a super-big deal.'' The stakes are high with <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON>. Not only are the potential financial rewards astronomical, but there is the cachet that comes with succeeding in a deal that carries a gargantuan price tag. And on a more subtle level are the egos of those who are driven to establish new benchmarks. Supervising the firm's proposal is <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON>, as prominent on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> social circuit as he is in the takeover game. He is widely expected to go the distance to protect his company's lockup of mega-sized leveraged buyouts. <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> was particularly miffed that <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON> was working with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>, because he had been interested in the Atlanta-based food and tobacco conglomerate for some time. <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> first broached the subject of leading a <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> buyout a year ago over dinner with <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON>'s decision to stick with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> even after meeting with <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> pits him against his one-time skiing partner, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>. The sometimes abrasive <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> has let slip in the press his astonishment that <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> would be such a tough competitor after skiing and socializing with him. But those who know them wonder just how close the pair was. `` They are competitors in the same arena. They know one another, but I do n't know if they are good friends. They're both very cool individuals,'' a takeover specialist said. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> is benefiting from <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s more subtle ties to <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON> in addition to having the support of the management team. <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> is said to be a close friend of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s parent In an earlier era, <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> worked on the same side of the fence as <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>. Within the past year <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> acquired <ORGANIZATION> Jim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 2.43 billion as <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> served as the board's banker And <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> served in the same capacity when <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> acquired <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 1.2 billion.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Narrows Sharply and Unexpectedly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s merchandise trade deficit narrowed sharply and unexpectedly in September, partly helped by erratic items such as exports of aircraft repairs and precious stones, the government said Thursday. The pound and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> stock prices shot up on the news, which somewhat eased growing concerns about <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s ballooning trade shortfall. The pound's jump, in turn, diminished fears that interest rates would head even higher. The trade deficit narrowed to 1.06 billion pounds, or $ 1.87 billion, in September from 1.81 billion pounds in August, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> said. The financial markets had expected the deficit to widen slightly. The current account deficit narrowed to 560 million pounds from 1.31 billion pounds, the department said. The current account includes `` invisible'' trade such as services, overseas investment earnings and official transfer payments, which the government estimated to be in surplus of 500 million pounds in the most recent month. Exports totaled 7.56 billion pounds in September, up from 6.75 billion pounds in August. Imports totaled 8.62 billion pounds in September, up from 8.56 billion pounds in August. Explaining the erratic items, the department said planes brought here for repair counted as imports in August and became exports last month when the work was done. Excluding these items, the merchandise trade deficit was 1.49 billion pounds in September, compared with 1.66 billion pounds in August. The pound gained almost 1.5 cents to $ 1.7735 in very active dealing minutes after the report was released. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index, off 5.6 points before the report, later was up 8 points at 1,858.7. Although markets were heartened by the report, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmonds </PERSON>, an economist at <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, said it was too early to conclude that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s trade deficit is narrowing significantly. He pointed out that Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> has said the trade deficit could remain large until 1990. The government's economic policies have come under criticism in recent months as inflation has heated up, prompting authorities to push up interest rates sharply. At the same time, the trade deficit outstripped government forecasts to hit record levels. Opposition Labor lawmaker <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, party spokesman on trade, called the latest figures `` a freak.'' Since the beginning of 1988, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s merchandise trade balance has been in deficit by 13.9 billion pounds, compared with a 6.88-billion-pound deficit a year earlier. In March, <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> predicted the trade deficit for the latest year would total 4 billion pounds.

 Americans' personal income rose 0.5 percent in September, despite a drop in farm income, while spending growth was the slowest since the October stock market crash, the government said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said income rose $ 19.9 billion to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 4.10 trillion last month, following a weak 0.3 percent increase in August and a strong 0.7 percent jump in July. Personal consumption spending, which includes everything except interest payments on debt, was flat in September at an annual rate of $ 3.26 trillion, following a 0.6 percent gain in August and a 0.4 percent increase the month before that. It was the weakest month for spending since October 1987, when it fell 0.2 percent. Analysts had attributed that drop to the shock from the stock crash. The spending data fits in with other statistics showing the economy growing more slowly at the end of the third quarter. Retail sales fell in both August and September and overall economic growth as measured by the gross national product was an anemic 2.2 percent in the third quarter. With spending holding steady and income rising, Americans saved more in September than in any month since May. The personal savings rate _ savings as a percentage of after-tax income _ was 4.2 percent last month, up from 3.8 percent in August. Personal income was held back by a $ 6.5 billion decrease in farm income, an apparent effect of the summer drought, even though government subsidy payments were unchanged. Wages and salaries, a key component of personal income, were up $ 14.1 billion, or 0.6 percent, in September, led by a 0.8 percent jump in manufacturing payrolls. Disposable, or after-tax, income was up 0.5 percent last month after a 0.3 percent gain. Personal tax payments in September, one of four payment months for taxpayers filing quarterly, were up $ 3.6 billion compared with an increase of $ 2.0 billion in August. Americans purchased $ 3.1 billion fewer durable goods, `` big ticket'' items expected to last three or more years. That nearly offset increases of $ 400 million in non-durable goods and $ 3.4 billion in services.

 Wheat futures prices opened slightly higher while soybeans and corn were mixed in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Wheat prices gained some strength from reports that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> may be targeted for a large wheat purchase, analysts said.

Despite some gains, the surge of follow-through buying that had been anticipated after Wednesday's late rally in grains and beans did not materialize, analysts said. In early trading, wheat was unchanged to -LCB- cent higher, with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.12 \ a bushel; corn was 1 -LCB- cents lower to 1 cent higher, with December at $ 2.79 a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 3 cents lower with December at $ 2.37 a bushel; and soybeans were 3 cents lower to 1 cent higher, with November at $ 7.66 -LCB- a bushel Live cattle and hog futures prices were mixed while pork belly prices dipped in early trading at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Chairman of MCorp Says Bankruptcy Filing `A High Probability'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The chairman of <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>, a Dallas-based bank holding company, says there is a high probability the company will file for reorganization in bankruptcy court or be forced into that action by creditors. `` I think everybody recognizes that there is a high probability that we will be in -LRB- Chapter 11 -RRB- bankruptcy within 30 days,'' chairman <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday. `` It's obvious that we can be forced and that we may not have any choice. `` In the interest of protecting our assets and our creditors, it's really the only alternative,'' he said. There had been recent speculation that the bank holding company, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' second-largest behind <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, was forcing the reorganization issue to advance its own plan to recapitalize. Chapter 11 protection would free the corporation from the threat of creditor lawsuits until it could develop a plan to put its finances in order. <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> announced earlier this week it would stop paying dividends to preferred shareholders and would cease payments on about $ 470 million in debt. That action effectively put the company's creditors on notice that they could push <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> into bankruptcy court after Nov. 21. `` When we made the decision last week to quit paying dividends and interest -LRB- on debt -RRB-, that gives us 30 days from that date, which is Nov. 21,'' <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> said. `` It's sometimes very hard to get the government's attention, and I do think now that we've got their attention,'' <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> said. `` The time clock is running now.'' <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> proposed a recapitalization package earlier this month that would include $ 400 million from the bank holding company itself, $ 400 million raised from investors and shareholders, and an undisclosed amount of aid from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts have estimated the company would need at least $ 1 billion in federal money <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> has set aside $ 400 million for the rescue and the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> wants the company to spread that money around to its ailing banks. `` The regulators... are saying we should use our money, and put it down in the banks and then they'll see what they can do for us,'' <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> said. `` They will give us no assurance they will do anything.'' <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> attorneys have told the company to leave the money where it is, partly for the recapitalization and partly so the board wo n't be sued by creditors upset that the holding company was putting all of its assets into its subsidiary banks. `` What we hope is that we'll be able to use that $ 400 million -LRB- belonging to the holding company -RRB- in connection with the recapitalization of all of the <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> banks,'' <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> said. The company could work out its differences with creditors, preferred shareholders and the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> in bankruptcy court, he said. <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> depositors, customers, and suppliers would not be affected by a reorganization proceeding, a spokesman said. `` The deposits would still be insured by the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, and it would be business as usual,'' the spokesman said.

 A judge has dismissed fines totaling $ 690,000 against <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morrell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for safety problems at its <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, plant, the company says. The fines, recommended by the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in April 1987, were at that time the third-largest in <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>'s history. They resulted from charges by <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Morrell </PERSON>, the nation's fifth-largest meatpacker, had willfully failed to record accidents at the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> plant. But the company, which is based here, said in a news release Wednesday that Administrative Law Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> ruled against <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>, saying the statute of limitations governing the violations had expired. The company said the judge he added that even if time had not run out, he would have reduced the fines should to only $ 11,000. <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON>, a judge with the <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, said the agency was incorrect to fine <PERSON> Morrell </PERSON> $ 10,000 for each of the 69 safety violations. The review commission in the past has said it is fundamentally unfair to assess multiple penalties for similar violations. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> representative <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikelson </PERSON> said the agency probably will appeal <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON>'s ruling to a higher review panel. Further appeals could take the case into the federal court system. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> is investigating <PERSON> Morrell </PERSON> for repetitive motion injuries sustained by its workers as well as other alleged physical hazards. Repetitive motion injuries include tendonitis, various postural strains and carpal tunnel syndrome, a debilitating nerve disorder. They occur when workers repeat the same motions over and over. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Crim </PERSON>, senior vice president at the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> plant, said, `` We have always felt the fines were grossly unfair and we would win our appeal to have them overturned.'' <PERSON> Morrell </PERSON> chairman <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Schloss </PERSON> has said he implemented a safety program that sharply reduced injury rates in the past few months.

<HEAD>Perot Drops Part of Lawsuit Against EDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>

 <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> billionaire <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> has withdrawn a request for a temporary order prohibiting <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> from interfering with his new data processing company, <ORGANIZATION> Perot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>. With Wednesday's action, <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> dropped part of his countersuit to a claim filed by EDS, which argued that by founding the new firm, <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> was violating a non-competition clause in the agreement he signed when he left EDS. In a hearing last week on EDS' suit, a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> judge ruled that <ORGANIZATION> Perot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> does not violate the agreement as long as it is operated on a non-profit basis until December 1989. <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> <PERSON> Yarbrough </PERSON>, <PERSON> Perot </PERSON>'s attorney, said the ruling negated the need to seek the preliminary injunction. EDS officials called the move a retreat from a `` nonsense'' lawsuit. `` <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> has just got to quit being so mad,'' EDS spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's just so long that you can carry on a vendetta like that before it becomes detrimental to business.'' <PERSON> Perot </PERSON>'s attorneys have contended that EDS has tried to put <ORGANIZATION> Perot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> out of business by interfering with pending contracts, intimidating prospective clients of <ORGANIZATION> Perot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> and intimidating EDS employees who might be considering joining <PERSON> Perot </PERSON>. The development is the latest in an ongoing legal battle involving <PERSON> Perot </PERSON>, EDS and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, EDS' parent company. The dispute centers around several paragraphs of a December 1986 buyout agreement between <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, in which <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> promised not to compete for profit with EDS until December 1989. EDS had sought to prevent <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> from operating any competing business until the terms of the contract expired. The full trial is set for April in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Koppers To Divide and Sell Chemical Unit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

 British industrialist <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON> said Thursday he plans to split up the chemicals unit of his Pittsburgh-based <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and sell them by January. <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> declined to disclose the total selling price, but indicated it would be more than the $ 660 million offered earlier this year by a management-led group. The number of employees at <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> headquarters, which has dropped from 500 to 280 since <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> was acquired in June, will be reduced to 90 after the sale of the chemicals units, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> also announced that <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' name would be changed to <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Materials </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> once the chemical unit was sold. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> manufactures construction materials and chemicals and is one of the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concerns producing road-building materials. <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON> told a group of investment bankers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that he had received at least three serious bids for each section of the chemical division, which has been split along product lines. `` We would expect to receive sales proceeds higher than if it had been sold -LRB- as one unit -RRB- last June,'' he said. `` At the present time we are negotiating with seven individual buyers. We consider it in the best interests of all concerned.'' <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a Bath, England-based homebuilding and construction materials company, purchased <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> in June for $ 1.8 billion after a bitter struggle by <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> management. <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>'s stock will be listed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> starting Friday. The company said its expansion efforts had been strengthened by the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>, coming after the 1986 purchase of Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> Gifford-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which makes cement and builds houses in several states Since the purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> has sold four of its units for $ 90 million and is in the process of selling two others for $ 60 million, <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> said.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar fell Thursday against most major currencies in active European trading after hitting four-month lows on a report of unexpectedly low <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic growth. Gold prices were higher. The dollar came under renewed pressure at midday, partly pushed down by a report of a narrower-than-expected British trade deficit in September and continued selling pressure related to Wednesday's report of a modest rise in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gross national product `` People are uncertain following the surprisingly good figures from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>,'' said a senior dealer at a bank in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` They were buying -LRB- British -RRB- pounds and selling dollars.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s merchandise deficit narrowed to 1.06 billion pounds -LRB- $ 1.87 billion -RRB- in September, partly helped by erratic items such as exports of aircraft repairs and precious stones, the government said Thursday. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government said the third-quarter gross national product rose at an annual rate of 2.2 percent, the smallest rise in almost two years. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar fell 0.90 Japanese yen to a closing 125.90 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it slipped back further to 125.75 yen. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound rose to $ 1.7695 from $ 1.7600 late Wednesday. Dealers said the dollar recovered some ground in late European trading on buying by Japanese traders. Market fears of central bank intervention had prevented the dollar from falling further. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.7725 West German marks, down from 1.7745; 1.4915 Swiss francs, down from 1.5065; 6.0455 French francs, down from 6.0725; 1.9977 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0005; 1,320.00 Italian lire, down from 1,323.50; and 1.2024 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1988 Gold bullion edged higher in lethargic trading in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Construction Contracts to Fall 4 Percent in 1989, Economist Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Embargoed for Release at 6:30 p.m. EDT</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Contracting for new construction will fall 4 percent next year to a total of $ 241 billion, an economist said Thursday. Continuing high vacancy rates in offices and apartments, and rising mortgage interest rates, will bring a decline in both commercial and residential building, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>, vice president and chief economist of <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. In the first nine months of this year, new building contracting declined about 3 percent from the 1987 level, according to <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION>. `` The state of the construction industry as we near the close of 1988 is best described as one quarter in decline, another quarter in limbo, and the remaining half in jeopardy,'' <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executives </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. Contracting is off 40 percent in the overdeveloped commercial building sector, where high vacancy rates persist, <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> said. He said public works construction is in limbo because of the drive to cut the federal budget deficit. Single-family housing and institutional construction are in jeopardy, <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> noted, since they are sensitive to interest rates. `` Rising mortgage and bond rates pose a threat in the near future to at least half of all construction activity,'' he said. <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> predicted that rising interest rates will produce a drop in single-family housing starts to 900,000 units in 1989 from 975,000 this year. The economist forecast that an 18 percent drop in retail building, to $ 18.9 billion, will help fuel an anticipated 8 percent decline next year in commercial construction.

 The stock market posted a broad loss today as traders showed signs of wariness over the recent wave of corporate buyout bids. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 24.71 to 2,140.47 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.

Huge bids for companies like <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> in recent days have dominated conversations on Wall Street.

<HEAD>City Growth Seems Fastest in Midwest, Accounting Firm Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Economic growth in the nation's largest cities appears to be rising fastest in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, according to a study released Thursday by the accounting firm <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>. In the past three years, by contrast, economic growth has been strongest in Eastern cities, New York-based <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> said. The <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> index showed that, in the second quarter, the average rate of economic growth for Midwestern cities rose more than the comparable rates for cities in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> and South. The index is a quarterly composite of seven economic indicators collected for 24 major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities. In the second quarter, the firm said, the seven fastest-growing metropolitan economies were those of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. The index for three cities _ <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> _ was unchanged in the second quarter from the first, <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> said. Three other cities showed an economic decline: <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The economic indicators used to rank the cities include commercial and residential construction permits, average weekly hours worked by manufacturing employees, business starts and failures, and retail sales. After the seven cities with the fastest-growing economies, the others in descending order of magnitude are <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> is a 64-year-old firm that provides accounting, audit, tax and management consulting services in more than 50 countries.

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday reported an industry earnings record of $ 859.2 million for the third quarter, eclipsing rival <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, while <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said its earnings dropped 54.3 percent for the period. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said its quarterly earnings, which work out to $ 2.46 a share, came on sales of $ 25.04 billion. On Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> reported third-quarter earnings of $ 856.3 million, or $ 1.78 a share, on sales of $ 17.73 billion. It was the first time in five quarters that <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> has outearned <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stempel </PERSON> credited the company's performance to growing North American sales and continued strength in the foreign markets, especially in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> had originally reported a profit of $ 812.3 million, or $ 2.28 a share, for the third quarter of 1987, but said today that accounting changes made the comparable figures for last year $ 421 million, or $ 1.05 per share. Adjusted sales for the third quarter of last year amounted to $ 22.6 billion, the company said. For the first nine months of 1988, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 3.46 billion, or $ 10.09 per share, up 27.4 percent from $ 2.72 billion, or $ 7.70 per share, during the January-September period last year. Sales for the first nine months of this year amounted to $ 81.38 billion, up 7.9 percent from the $ 75.4 billion in sales during the first three quarters of 1987. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s results surprised auto analysts. `` The consensus for guys on Wall Street for the third quarter was a $ 1.50 -LRB- per share -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` I think they did better in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> than most people expected,'' <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON> said. `` <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, last year through the first three quarters, did n't make any money on their North American operations.

The benefit came from overseas and the benefit came from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' While <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> was spreading good news about its earnings on Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> was spreading hope for the future in the nation's third-largest automaker. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 112.5 million, or 50 cents a share, on sales of $ 7.01 billion during the July-September period this year. During the three-month period last year, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 246 million, or $ 1.12 a share, on sales of $ 6.17 billion. In a statement, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> said its earnings were hurt by high costs of incentives, which the company used extensively to lure buyers into showrooms, and the closing for the entire period of the <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, assembly plant. For the first nine months of this year, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings fell 34.4 percent to $ 616.6 million, or $ 2.77 a share, from $ 939.5 million, or $ 4.33 a share, last year. Sales for the first nine months of 1988 amounted to $ 23.17 billion, compared with $ 18.61 billion in 1987, a 24.5 percent increase. `` We're launching promising products here and overseas, and we're proceeding with our plan to spend $ 13.5 billion in the next five years on new products, processes and plant improvements,'' <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said `` These investments will give us an edge as we do battle with scores of competitors from every corner of the globe.'' Also Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported record third-quarter earnings of $ 59 million, 20 percent more than the $ 49 million it earned during the third quarter of last year. For the first nine months of 1988, the financial arm of the corporation earned $ 185 million, a nine-month record and up 12 percent from the $ 166 million it earned during the January-September period last year.

The Toronto-based compaa retail industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prescott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Turben who tracks <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, said investors were uneasy about the overall leveraged buyout situation, but said there also were concerns about <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s financial health. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said the sales of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> units had not been strong, noting that the store divisions reported hefty losses from high interest expenses in its most recent quarterly report.

 <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday its earnings soared eightfold in the third quarter as the company continued to benefit from a record cash settlement of its litigation with <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> said all segments of its Houston-based energy company contributed toward the improved profits, with increased earnings in the oil and gas, sulphur and refinery operations For the third quarter, after-tax profits totaled $ 39.8 million, or 93 cents per share, compared with $ 4.7 million, or 2 cents per share, a year earlier. Third-quarter revenue rose 37.1 percent to $ 617 million from $ 450 million in the July-September quarter of 1987. Profits for the first nine months of 1988 were $ 1.4 billion, or $ 36 per share, on revenues of $ 1.65 billion, compared with $ 26 million, or 35 cents per share, on revenues of $ 1.34 billion during the same 1987 period. Earnings for the nine-month period of 1988 include a $ 1.7 billion extraordinary gain, or $ 41.83 per share, associated with the $ 3 billion cash settlement with <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier this year, <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> agreed to accept the settlement from <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> to resolve an $ 11.1 billion court judgment won by <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> against its oil company rival in a 1985 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> trial. In that case, a jury found <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> had interfered with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to buy <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. In the most recent quarter, <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> also showed after-tax non-cash charges of $ 303 million, or $ 7.65 per share, resulting from the disposition and write-down of certain assets and other charges. Third-quarter earnings improved dramatically because of investment income and increased operating income in all divisions, including $ 5.1 million from <ORGANIZATION> Facet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a filtration products company acquired in May 1988. Investment income in the third quarter was $ 53.3 million, compared with $ 11.2 million in the third quarter of 1987, the company said.

 The dollar ended mostly higher Thursday after a seesaw session influenced largely by rumors of central bank support, but money dealers said the underlying trend for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency is down. Gold prices eased in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> after strengthening in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> quoted bullion at $ 407.50 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $ 408.15 at the same time Wednesday. Currency dealers said the dollar weakened early in the day based on its sharp decline Wednesday, when a government report of slower-than-expected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic growth depressed the dollar to the lowest level in four months. But rumors quickly surfaced that the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> had intervened by buying dollars to support the currency. Traders said there were other rumors, later denied, that the Swiss and West German central banks were buying dollars. The dollar strengthened on those rumors although it lost ground to the British pound, which surged on news of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s narrowing trade deficit. `` We actually saw the dollar move in a relatively wide range,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON>, senior corporate dealer at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> branch of <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. `` Most of the movement on the back of unconcrete information.'' <PERSON> Zlatko </PERSON> <PERSON> Glamuzina </PERSON>, a senior trader for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> branch of <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> di </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sicilia </ORGANIZATION>, said that because of the rumors and the dollar's upward move, `` we lost the drive to push the dollar down. Although he predicted the dollar could rise more over the next few days, `` there are quite a few people who expect the dollar to go lower.'' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar fell 0.90 Japanese yen to 125.90 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> it slipped further to 125.75 yen.

<TEXT>
 Elderly people who are `` house rich and cash poor'' will be able to apply for government-backed reverse mortgages that could pay them up to several hundred dollars a month for the rest of their lives, under a plan announced Thursday. The demonstration project sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> and backed by federal lending institutions will provide 2,500 home equity conversion mortgages beginning next April. The reverse mortgage, in effect, gives the elderly income in exchange for a lien on their property. `` This is another option to help older people survive and thrive in our country,'' said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON>, national commissioner on aging, who appeared with housing officials at a news conference announcing the plan. To be eligible, applicants must be at least 62 years old, either own or have a very low mortgage on the home in which they live, and undergo counseling by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> housing experts. Such counseling ordinarily would include potential heirs to the property, who likely would have to sell the house to pay off the principal, interest and mortgage fees after the borrower dies, officials said. The reverse mortgages will be available from regular lending institutions but will be backed by the government so there will be no risk of payments being cut off or of loss to the lender, said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beirne </PERSON>, assistant housing secretary. By pooling the risk, lenders will be protected against the small percentage of cases in which borrowers might live long enough to collect more than the value of the house, he said. `` Too many Americans who work most of their lives to pay off their mortgages wake up one morning to find that they are house rich and cash poor,'' said Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wortley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who worked on legislation setting up the program. The project effectively will double the number of reverse mortgages available in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. About 2,000 have been issued by private lenders in about seven states, most of them allowing the lender to share in the increased value of the home. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> also may insure such loans, but lender profits generally would be limited to interest on the loan and a possible co-insurance arrangement where they absorb some of the risk involved, officials said. `` It will be possible for the elderly to take out a reverse mortgage without putting out a penny,'' said <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> policy analyst who helped design the program. She said borrowers can either receive monthly payments that will end only if they die or sell the house, or they may get payments for a set term or a line of credit that can be drawn upon as they need it. The amount available will depend on the interest rate, age of the youngest borrower, value of the house and the maximum <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> loan available for the area where the house is located. The maximum ranges from $ 67,500 to $ 101,250. Monthly payments on a 10 percent mortgage would range from $ 81 for a 62-year-old borrower in a house valued at $ 50,000 to $ 662 for an 85-year-old in a house valued at $ 100,000 or more. The older the applicant, the higher the amount of money available. Some adjustments could be made before final rules are adopted, following a 60-day period for public comment, officials said. The limited number of loans to be available initially will be distributed by regions of the country according to the number of elderly home owners living in the area, officials said. Representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Fannie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- announced they would purchase loans under the plan. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> says 73 percent of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s 18.9 million elderly own their own homes, and 83 percent of those, or 11.5 million, owe nothing on them. That creates a potential reverse mortgage market of $ 700 billion, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schainker </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Fannie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION> senior vice president.

<HEAD>Data General Losses Widen In Quarter; Prime Earnings Drop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the minicomputer company, said Thursday its losses widened to nearly $ 50 million in the latest quarter because of a major charge to pay for a cost-cutting consolidation. <ORGANIZATION> Prime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, another minicomputer maker, said its third-quarter profit fell 26 percent in spite of the increased revenue from its acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Computervision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The company said its fortunes were improving because revenue was up and income from operations, not counting restructuring charges, had also increased. Data General, based in <LOCATION> Westboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said it lost $ 49.8 million in the fourth quarter ended Sept. 24, double the losses of $ 24.6 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 3 percent to $ 341.5 million from $ 332.3 million. A restructuring charge of $ 48.7 million in the quarter covered the cost of consolidation of manufacturing and product repair operations. For the full fiscal year, <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> said its losses fell to $ 15.5 million from $ 123.7 million a year earlier. The 1987 period included a restructuring charge of $ 53.8 million. Revenue for the fiscal year rose 7 percent to $ 1.36 billion from $ 1.27 billion. Prime Computer in <LOCATION> Natick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, attributed its own earnings decline to reorganization and softening demand. For the third quarter, earnings totaled $ 11.7 million, or 24 cents per share, on revenue of $ 391.4 million, compared with earnings of $ 15.9 million, or 32 cents per share, on revenue of $ 236.2 million in 1987. For the first nine months of its fiscal year, net income totaled $ 33.4 million, or 69 cents a share, down from $ 43.5 million, or 88 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $ 1.16 billion from $ 694 million. The 1987 results do not include <ORGANIZATION> Computervision </ORGANIZATION>, which Prime acquired in February 1988.

<HEAD>Copper See-Saws On Concerns Over Strike In Peru</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS lead to CLARIFY prices touched lows and rebounded, also
CORRECT demand to supplies.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
 Copper futures prices touched the lows of the week before rallying Thursday at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where a strike in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and tight supplies remained the major concerns. In other markets, wheat prices were mixed; corn and soybeans declined; gold and silver prices dipped; cattle prices were mostly lower and hog prices fell. Crude oil and heating oil rallied but unleaded gasoline prices were mostly lower. Copper prices continued the slide that began Wednesday on expectations of possible negotiations between striking miners and officials in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, one of the world's major copper producers, but the slide was reversed later in the session, analysts said. As the session progressed, there were no signs of an imminent settlement to the strike, which could further restrict already tight copper supplies, said <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Raptopoulous </PERSON>, a metals analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` One of the major producers says if the strike continues, they'll declare a ` force majeure,''' a declaration of an inability to deliver supplies, she said, and anticipation of tightening supplies sparked a late flurry of buying. Copper prices settled .35 cent to 1.65 cents higher, with October at $ 1.38 cents a pound. At the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, word from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is being offered 550,000 tons of wheat under the export bonus plan sparked buying in the wheat pit, analysts said. But the slide of corn and soybean prices confirmed sentiment that Wednesday's late rally `` was just a bubble,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Harvest pressure, lack of demand and improved weather in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, a major soybean producer, all kept the lid on prices, <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> said. `` The markets are showing their true colors'' after Wednesday's rally, he said Wheat settled -RCB- cent lower to 4 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.11 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 5 -RCB- cents lower, with December at $ 2.74 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 3 -LCB- cents to 7 -RCB- cents lower, with December at $ 2.32 \ a bushel; and soybeans were 5 cents to 9 cents lower, with November at $ 7.59 a bushel Cattle prices were mostly lower and hog prices declined in trading at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Reports of good box beef movement added an early firm tone to cattle prices, but they fell on concerns over ample supplies of competitive meats later in the day, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Sterling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. A weaker cash market sparked selling in the live hog pit, while larger-than-expected movement of pork bellies into storage last week pressured belly prices, he said Live cattle prices settled .23 cent lower to .2 cent higher, with December at 73.67 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 1.05 cents lower to .5 cent higher, with October at 81.45 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent to .53 cent lower, with December at 41.21 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were 1.07 cents to 1.40 cents lower, with February at 48.10 a pound. Trading in gold and silver was quiet at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where traders are moving cautiously in the waning days before the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential election, Ms. <PERSON> Raptopoulous </PERSON> said. Uncertainty over the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar and crude oil prices also has kept a lid on activity in the precious metals pits, she said. Gold prices settled 70 cents to $ 1.40 lower, with the contract for delivery in October at $ 407.60 a troy ounce; silver prices were 2.4 cents to 3.4 cents lower, with October at $ 6.20 a troy ounce. Oil futures prices rallied while unleaded gasoline prices settled mixed in trading at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Selling on technical factors pressured gasoline prices, while trading in crude oil was quiet as traders cautiously await some word from <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> on production quotas, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in Crude oil prices settled unchanged to 27 cents higher, with the December contract at $ 13.68 dollars a barrel; heating oil prices were .64 cent to 1.49 cents higher, with November at 43.04 cents a gallon; and unleaded gas was .95 cent lower to 1.12 cents higher, with November at 50.72 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>UAL, Delta Post Higher Profit in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> and the parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that strong passenger traffic boosted their third-quarter profit substantially from a year earlier. Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said its net income in the three months ended Sept. 30 more than quadrupled to $ 402.4 million, or $ 18.68 a share, from $ 82.3 million, or $ 1.41 a shre, a year earlier. The latest per-share profit was calculated on the basis of about 21.5 million shares outstanding, while the third quarter of 1987 was based on 58.4 million shares. Third-quarter revenue rose to $ 2.41 billion from $ 2.26 billion. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, whose main subsidiary is <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, said its revenue passenger miles increased 5 percent during the quarter from a year earlier. A revenue passenger mile represents one paying passenger flown one mile and is used to determine an airline's capacity. United is the nation's largest airline. In August, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> completed the sale of 50 percent of its interest in the <ORGANIZATION> Covia </ORGANIZATION> partnership, which owns the Apollo computer reservations system, for $ 499 million. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, formerly called <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, sold the stake to five airlines: <ORGANIZATION> Alitalia </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Swissair </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. In the first nine months of the year, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s profit surged to $ 1.10 billion, or $ 34.35 a share, from $ 125.2 million, or $ 2.26 a share. Nine-month revenue rose to $ 6.75 billion from $ 6.19 billion. `` While we are pleased with the achievements of the last three quarters, we understand we must produce these kinds of results consistently if we are to meet the capital requirements of replacing and expanding our fleet,'' Chairman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, the third-largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline, said its third-quarter profit jumped 69 percent to $ 99.95 million, or $ 2.03 a share, from $ 59.1 million, or $ 1.22 a share, a year earlier. Third-quarter revenue rose 15 percent, to $ 1.88 billion from $ 1.63 billion. `` Strong growth in passenger revenue was a principal ingredient in <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s record financial results,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roeck </PERSON>, chief financial officer. Revenue passenger miles were up 10 percent, reflecting `` general good economic conditions, the benefits of our merger with <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, and growth in domestic and international operations,'' <PERSON> Roeck </PERSON> said. In the first nine months, net income surged 80 percent to $ 259.4 million, or $ 5.30 a share. Nine-month revenue increased 18 percent, to $ 5.47 billion from $ 4.65 billion.

 The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply rose in mid-October, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,043.1 billion in the week ended Oct. 17 from $ 3,036.1 billion the previous week.

The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a seasonally adjusted $ 783.6 billion from $ 784.8 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds.

Newspapers officials are hoping a victory before the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> scheduled to hear arguments in the case Friday convinces opponents of a joint operating agreement to forgo a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> challenge. That would allow the newspapers to merge advertising, circulation and business operations _ while keeping separate news and editorial departments _ a move they have said is vital if the Free Press is to survive. An adverse ruling by the three-judge panel could force <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, owner of the 157-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, to decide whether it wants to pursue a lengthy <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> battle. `` That's such a hypothetical question, I do n't see any value in speculating on something like that,'' <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, owner of the News, has said it will operate the News with or without a JOA <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> has said if a <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> were denied it would close the Free Press, putting its 2,200 employees out of work. But <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> said he did n't know if the chain would choose to ride out another year or more of uncertainty and newspaper losses that a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> battle would involve. `` The options are beginning to narrow now,'' he said. Former Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> approved a <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> in an Aug. 8 ruling.

 Canadian auto parts maker <ORGANIZATION> Magna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it has formed a new unit to build small-volume specialty vehicles, or niche cars, for its large automaker customers. The new <ORGANIZATION> Vehma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> will prove its capabilities by unveiling a high-performance concept car at the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and Exposition in February in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingl </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Magna </ORGANIZATION> president, said at a news conference. `` It will measure up to anything which is running on four wheels today,'' <PERSON> Gingl </PERSON> said. He said the car wo n't compete with the big manufacturers. The aim is to show them that the design, styling, engineering, tooling, manufacturing and testing capabilities Magna already uses to supply parts can be combined to produce entire cars, <PERSON> Gingl </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Vehma </PERSON> is negotiating with `` one or more'' auto companies for such contracts, he said. He said depending on the outcome, Vehma may build one or more assembly plants in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Magna currently employs 13,000 people at 120 plants in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and makes more than 6,000 products for the global automotive market. It had sales of $ 1.2 billion in its 1988 fiscal year, which ended July 31. Magna is made up of four subsidiaries: <ORGANIZATION> Cosma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, making body parts; <ORGANIZATION> Atoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, making interior assemblies; <ORGANIZATION> Decoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, making exterior trim, and <ORGANIZATION> Tesma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, making drivetrain systems. <PERSON> Gingl </PERSON> said <PERSON> Vehma </PERSON> would carry out assembly operations involving 8,000 to 15,000 cars a year. A moderately sized plant operated by a major automaker produces volumes in the 250,000-a-year range. Vehma could build one of its specialized plants for $ 40 million to $ 70 million, he said. Auto analyst <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Sudol </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Fitch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said an automaker could save by contracting with <PERSON> Vehma </PERSON> to assemble a vehicle aimed at a small marketing niche rather than interrupting a high-volume assembly line for such a project. Profits would have to be high to justify contracting out the work, <PERSON> Sudol </PERSON> said. `` It could make sense to farm them out if they were upmarket vehicles with large profit margins and limited runs. I do n't think you could build econoboxes that way,'' she said. <PERSON> Gingl </PERSON> said the operation would not resemble companies that take manufacturers' finished vehicles and modify them _ to make convertibles or custom vans, for example. `` I'm not talking about a conversion factory here,'' he said.

 The price Americans pay for imported goods fell 1.1 percent from July through September, the first decline in more than two years, the government reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attributed the quarterly drop to a fall in crude oil prices and a rise in the value of the dollar against overseas currencies. A stronger dollar boosts Americans' purchasing power for foreign goods and also tends to make <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports more expensive. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export prices rose 2 percent during the July-September quarter, the department said. The report said the dollar, after falling in value for three years, rose by 4.2 percent on a trade-weighted basis against other currencies during the third quarter. It had edged up by 0.3 percent in the second quarter. Despite these increases, the dollar is still 28.8 percent lower than its high point reached in March 1985, according to the currency index used by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Many economists contend that further improvement in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchandise trade deficit will require further declines in the dollar, with some suggesting a drop of 20 percent may be needed. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ran a record $ 170.3 billion merchandise trade deficit for all of 1987. For the first eight months of this year, the deficit has been running at an annual rate of $ 139 billion. The 1.1 percent drop in import prices from July through September was the first since a 3.3 percent decline in the first quarter of 1986 that was attributed primarily to a fall in energy prices. Lower oil prices also played a large part in the July-September drop. Without a 7.1 percent plunge in the price of imported energy, the overall import decline would have been a smaller 0.6 percent. There were also declines in other areas, including a 1.1 percent drop in imported food prices and a 0.5 percent redcution in machinery prices. Even with the July-September decline, import prices are still 4.1 percent higher than they were a year ago. The 2 percent rise in export prices followed a 2.8 percent increase in the April-June quarter. Export prices are now 8.7 percent higher than a year ago. Food exports led the list of third-quarter price increases, shooting up 14.8 percent in reflecting the impact of the summer drought in the Farm Belt. Food exports had risen by 8.6 percent in the second quarter and are now 36.8 percent higher than a year ago. The category of machinery and transport equipment, which constitutes nearly one-half of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports, rose by 0.5 percent in the third quarter following a 0.8 percent rise in the second quarter. Prices of crude materials, which had been rising rapidly, edged up just 0.6 percent in the third quarter, the smallest increase in two years.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has subpoenaed the owners of a partnership making a $ 2.7 billion hostile takeover bid for <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in connection with an investigation of possible antitrust violations, the partnership disclosed Thursday. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rales </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partnership </ORGANIZATION>, and others were served with subpoenas on Oct. 24 requiring the Raleses to produce documents, said <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>, a spokesperson for the brothers. Ms. <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>, an employee of D.F. <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said neither her company nor the Raleses, who are <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, businessmen, would comment regarding the subpoena. The Rales brothers lead an investor group that controls about 8.7 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION>'s stock, and has offered to pay $ 74 a share to acquire the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis-based </LOCATION> furniture and apparel company. In August, <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> charged in a lawsuit that the group violated various provisions of the Hart-Scott-Rodino federal antitrust law. Sens. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo., and <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, R-Mo., then asked the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> to expedite its investigation of the hostile bid for A statement issued Thursday on behalf of the Raleses reiterated the partnership's previous contention that it believed it had not violated the antitrust law in connection with the purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> shares. It also noted that the <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 23, 1988 concluded that <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> failed to prove that antitrust laws were violated in connection with the purchase of its shares by the Rales group. <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> rejected the <PERSON> Rales </PERSON> offer on Sept. 20 and countered with a multibillion-dollar defensive restructuring that includes special $ 25-a-share dividend to its stockholders. The company is the maker of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Fog rainwear, <PERSON> Ethan </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> furniture and <ORGANIZATION> Florsheim </ORGANIZATION> shoes, among other products. <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> said it was considering alternatives to the Rales offer, including the possible sale of the company to other parties. In a <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> filing, <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> said confidential information had been given to unnamed parties that agreed not to buy <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> stock or make an offer for three years without <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION>'s permission The Rales brothers own <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which markets home siding for <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>; Mid-South Building Supply; and <ORGANIZATION> Easco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tools </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which makes the Craftsman line of hand tools. In August, the <PERSON> Rales </PERSON> won regulatory approval to take over local radio station <ORGANIZATION> WGMS </ORGANIZATION> in partnership. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> scrutinizes bidders in takeover attempts to ensure that companies comply with various disclosure provisions and waiting periods that give the agency information to determine if companies violated antitrust and disclosure laws. If an investor group led by the <PERSON> Rales </PERSON> brothers were found guilty of violating antitrust laws, the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> could impose fines, bar future purchases of <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> stock and force the divestiture of <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> shares. But Ms. <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> issued a statement Thursday saying `` The Purchaser believes that the investigation will have no impact upon the offer.''

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar moved higher against the Japanese yen Friday morning, while stock prices declined moderately. After opening at 126.10 yen, up 0.20 yen from Thursday's close, the dollar held to a narrow range and was changing hands at 126.04 yen by mid-morning. Currency dealers said the market was being cautious about possible intervention by the nation's central bank to brake any sudden plunge in the dollar. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> stepped into the market to buy dollars and prop up the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency Thursday when the dollar opened at a four-month low. The opening followed the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> quarterly economic figures showing unexpectedly lower growth during the July-September period. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 102.31-point winner the previous day, was down 100.67 points at 27,622.25 by the close of the morning session. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, dealers said the slip in the market's main barometer was triggered by profit-taking among some investors after three consecutive days of gains in the index. `` The market still has a lot of energy, but the index is n't moving yet,'' said one dealer with a major securities firm in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, speaking anonymously
